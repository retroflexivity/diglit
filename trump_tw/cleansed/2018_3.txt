Alan Dershowitz These are not crimes He (Mueller) has no authority to be a roving Commissioner I don’t see any evidence of crimes  This is an illegal Hoax that should be ended immediately Mueller refuses to look at the real crimes on the other side Where is the IG REPORT
This demonstrates the Robert Mueller and his partisans have no evidence not a whiff of collusion between Trump and the Russians Russian project legal Trump Tower meeting (son Don) perfectly legal He wasn’t involved with hacking     Gregg Jarrett  A total Witch Hunt
Just landed in Argentina with  Melania  
As RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel oversaw history defying gains in the Senate and unprecedented fundraising strength I have asked her to serve another term for my 2020 re-elect because there is no one better for the job
We have been working hard on this and it’s only going to get better

 has written an absolutely fascinating book (BACK IN THE GAME) on the world of DC politics and more He has experienced so much in a short period of time Few people have had his bravery or courage and he has come all the way back A big power and great person
in Argentina with President Vladimir Putin I look forward to a meaningful Summit again as soon as this situation is resolved
Based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to Ukraine from Russia I have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting
Billions of Dollars are pouring into the coffers of the USA because of the Tariffs being charged to China and there is a long way to go If companies don’t want to pay Tariffs build in the USA Otherwise lets just make our Country richer than ever before
When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever end-or will it just go on forever After wasting more than $40000000 (is that possible) it has proven only one thing-there was NO Collusion with Russia So Ridiculous
Did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime At the same time Mueller and the Angry Democrats aren’t even looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats A total disgrace
General Motors is very counter to what other auto and other companies are doing Big Steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country Auto companies are pouring into the US including BMW which just announced a major new plant The USA is booming
So much happening with the now discredited Witch Hunt This total Hoax will be studied for years
Sebastian Gorka a very talented man who I got to know well while he was working at the White House has just written an excellent book Why We Fight Much will be learned from this very good read
On behalf of  Melania and the entire Trump family I want to wish you all a very MERRY CHRISTMAS May this Christmas Season bring peace to your hearts warmth to your homes cheer to your spirits and JOY TO THE WORLD 🎄

and GM would not be closing their plants in Ohio Michigan  Maryland Get smart Congress Also the countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the US for decades The President has great power on this issue Because of the GM event it is being studied now
The reason that the small truck business in the US is such a go to favorite is that for many years Tariffs of 25percent have been put on small trucks coming into our country It is called the chicken tax If we did that with cars coming in many more cars would be built here
While the disgusting Fake News is doing everything within their power not to report it that way at least 3 major players are intimating that the Angry Mueller Gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts  they will get relief This is our Joseph McCarthy Era
Congratulations to Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith on your big WIN in the Great State of Mississippi We are all very proud of you
Brenda Snipes in charge of voting in Broward County Florida was just spotted wearing a beautiful dress with 300 I VOTED signs on it Just kidding she is a fine very honorable and highly respected voting tactician
The Mueller Witch Hunt is a total disgrace They are looking at supposedly stolen Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails (even though they don’t want to look at the DNC Server) but have no interest in the Emails that Hillary DELETED  acid washed AFTER getting a Congressional Subpoena
for electric cars General Motors made a big China bet years ago when they built plants there (and in Mexico) don’t think that bet is going to pay off I am here to protect America’s Workers
Very disappointed with General Motors and their CEO Mary Barra for closing plants in Ohio Michigan and Maryland Nothing being closed in Mexico  China The US saved General Motors and this is the THANKS we get We are now looking at cutting all  subsidies including
Polls are open in Mississippi We need Cindy Hyde-Smith in Washington GO OUT AND VOTE Thanks
terrible Gang of Angry Democrats Look at their past and look where they come from The now $30000000 Witch Hunt continues and they’ve got nothing but ruined lives Where is the Server Let these terrible people go back to the Clinton Foundation and Justice Department
The Fake News Media builds Bob Mueller up as a Saint when in actuality he is the exact opposite He is doing TREMENDOUS damage to our Criminal Justice System where he is only looking at one side and not the other Heroes will come of this and it won’t be Mueller and his
The Phony Witch Hunt continues but Mueller and his gang of Angry Dems are only looking at one side not the other Wait until it comes out how horribly  viciously they are treating people ruining lives for them refusing to lie Mueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue

and false way Something has to be done including the possibility of the United States starting our own Worldwide Network to show the World the way we really are GREAT
While CNN doesn’t do great in the United States based on ratings outside of the US they have very little competition Throughout the world CNN has a powerful voice portraying the United States in an unfair
On the ten-year anniversary of the Mumbai terror attack the US stands with the people of India in their quest for justice The attack killed 166 innocents including six Americans We will never let terrorists win or even come close to winning
hundreds of people closely involved with my campaign who never met saw or spoke to a Russian during this period So many campaign workers people inside from the beginning ask me why they have not been called (they want to be) There was NO Collusion  Mueller knows it
When Mueller does his final report will he be covering all of his conflicts of interest in a preamble will he be recommending action on all of the crimes of many kinds from those on the other side(whatever happened to Podesta) and will he be putting in statements from
Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants many of whom are stone cold criminals back to their countries Do it by plane do it by bus do it anyway you want but they are NOT coming into the USA We will close the Border permanently if need be Congress fund the WALL
children from parents as did Bush etc because that is the policy and law I tried to keep them together but the problem is when you do that vast numbers of additional people storm the Border So with Obama seperation is fine but with Trump it’s not Fake 60 Minutes
 did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the Obama Administration In fact a picture of children in jails was used by other Fake Media to show how bad (cruel) we are but it was in 2014 during O years Obama separated
Clinton Foundation donations drop 42percent which shows that they illegally played the power game They monetized their political influence through the Foundation During her tenure the State Department was put in the service of the Clinton Foundation  Andrew McCarthy
Europe has to pay their fair share for Military Protection The European Union for many years has taken advantage of us on Trade and then they don’t live up to their Military commitment through NATO Things must change fast
General Anthony Tata President Trump is a man of his word  he said he was going to be tough on the Border and he is tough on the Border He has rightfully strengthened the Border in the face of an unprecedented threat It’s the right move by President Trump Thanks General
Mississippi Vote for  on Tuesday Respected by all We need her in Washington Thanks
So great that oil prices are falling (thank you President T) Add that which is like a big Tax Cut to our other good Economic news Inflation down (are you listening Fed)
Would be very SMART if Mexico would stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in US No longer) Dems created this problem No crossings
The large and violent French protests don’t take into account how badly the United States has been treated on Trade by the European Union or on fair and reasonable payments for our GREAT military protection Both of these topics must be remedied soon
I will be in Gulfport and Tupelo Mississippi on Monday night doing two Rallies for Senator Hyde-Smith who has a very important Election on Tuesday She is an outstanding person who is strong on the Border Crime Military our great Vets Healthcare  the 2nd A Needed in DC
Victor Davis Hanson was a very good and interesting guest of Mark Levin on  He wrote a highly touted book called The Second World Wars and a new book will soon be coming out called The Case For Trump Recommend both 
All will stay in Mexico If for any reason it becomes necessary we will CLOSE our Southern Border There is no way that the United States will after decades of abuse put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore
Migrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court We only will allow those who come into our Country legally Other than that our very strong policy is Catch and Detain No Releasing into the US
I am extremely happy and proud of the job being done by  Secretary  The FAKE NEWS likes to write stories to the contrary quoting phony sources or jealous people but they aren’t true They never like to ask me for a quote b/c it would kill their story
Really good Criminal Justice Reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support  Mitch McConnell and  have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country Already passed with big vote in House Would be a major victory for ALL

Republicans and Democrats MUST come together finally with a major Border Security package which will include funding for the Wall After 40 years of talk it is finally time for action Fix the Border for once and for all NOW
Our highly trained security professionals are not allowed to do their job on the Border because of the Judicial Activism and Interference by the 9th Circuit Nevertheless they are working hard to make America a safer place though hard to do when anybody filing a lawsuit wins
This is the coldest weather in the history of the Thanksgiving Day Parade in NYC and one of the coldest Thanksgivings on record
Will be speaking with our great military in different parts of the world through teleconference at 9:00 AM Eastern Then it will be off to see our Coast Guard patriots  to thank them for the great job they have been doing especially with the hurricanes Happy Thanksgiving
and Safety at the Border or anywhere else They know nothing about it and are making our Country unsafe Our great Law Enforcement professionals MUST BE ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB If not there will be only bedlam chaos injury and death We want the Constitution as written
Justice Roberts can say what he wants but the 9th Circuit is a complete  total disaster It is out of control has a horrible reputation is overturned more than any Circuit in the Country 79percent  is used to get an almost guaranteed result Judges must not Legislate Security
HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL
It’s a mean  nasty world out there the Middle East in particular This is a long and historic commitment  one that is absolutely vital to America’s national security   I agree 100percent In addition many Billions of Dollars of purchases made in US big Jobs  Oil
You just can’t win with the Fake News Media A big story today is that because I have pushed so hard and gotten Gasoline Prices so low more people are driving and I have caused traffic jams throughout our Great Nation Sorry everyone
Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS Whatever happened to Global Warming
79percent of these decisions have been overturned in the 9th Circuit   A terrible costly and dangerous disgrace It has become a dumping ground for certain lawyers looking for easy wins and delays Much talk over dividing up the 9th Circuit into 2 or 3 Circuits Too big
There are a lot of CRIMINALS in the Caravan We will stop them Catch and Detain Judicial Activism by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens is putting our country in great danger Not good
Thank you to President Trump on the Border No American President has ever done this before Hector Garza National Border Patrol Council
are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there and why are a vast number of those cases overturned Please study the numbers they are shocking We need protection and security these rulings are making our country unsafe Very dangerous and unwise
Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts but you do indeed have Obama judges and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an independent judiciary but if it is why

I hope the discovery and eventual recovery of the Argentine submarine San Juan brings needed closure to the wonderful families of those brave missing sailors I look forward to hearing more from my friend President  in Argentina later this month
The Fake News is showing old footage of people climbing over our Ocean Area Fence This is what it really looks like no climbers anymore under our Administration 
We no longer pay Pakistan the $Billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us Bin Laden being a prime example Afghanistan being another They were just one of many countries that take from the United States without giving anything in return That’s ENDING
Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center President Clinton famously missed his shot We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars  they never told us he was living there Fools
 loves Mississippi and our Great USA 
From day one Rick Scott never wavered He was a great Governor and will be even a greater Senator in representing the People of Florida Congratulations to Rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign
Catch and Release is an obsolete term It is now Catch and Detain Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the USA often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for US Asylum will be detained or turned away Dems must approve Border Security  Wall NOW
The Mayor of Tijuana Mexico just stated that the City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants the backlog could last 6 months Likewise the US is ill-prepared for this invasion and will not stand for it They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico Go home
So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate
I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on  at 2:00 PM and 7:00 PM Enjoy

Congratulations to Andrew Gillum on having run a really tough and competitive race for Governor of the Great State of Florida He will be a strong Democrat warrior long into the future a force to reckon with
I can get Nancy Pelosi as many votes as she wants in order for her to be Speaker of the House She deserves this victory she has earned it but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away She will win 
Thank you  Look forward to joining you and  tomorrow in California We are with you 
their country’s flag Can this be possible Yes because it is all a BIG CON and the American taxpayer is paying for it
Isn’t it ironic that large Caravans of people are marching to our border wanting USA asylum because they are fearful of being in their country yet they are proudly waving
Congratulations to Brian Kemp on becoming the new Governor of Georgia Stacey Abrams fought brilliantly and hard she will have a terrific political future Brian was unrelenting and will become a great Governor for the truly Wonderful People of Georgia

The only Collusion is that of the Democrats with Russia and many others Why didn’t the FBI take the Server from the DNC They still don’t have it Check out how biased Facebook Google and Twitter are in favor of the Democrats That’s the real Collusion
Universities will someday study what highly conflicted (and NOT Senate approved) Bob Mueller and his gang of Democrat thugs have done to destroy people Why is he protecting Crooked Hillary Comey McCabe Lisa Page  her lover Peter S and all of his friends on the other side
care how many lives the ruin These are Angry People including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller who worked for Obama for 8 years They won’t even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY
The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts They are screaming and shouting at people horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want They are a disgrace to our Nation and don’t
The White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good We are the envy of the world But anytime I even think about making changes the FAKE NEWS MEDIA goes crazy always seeking to make us look as bad as possible Very dishonest

MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN
The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France 26percent and an unemployment rate of almost 10percent He was just trying to get onto another subject By the way there is no country more Nationalist than France very proud people-and rightfully so
On Trade France makes excellent wine but so does the US The problem is that France makes it very hard for the US to sell its wines into France and charges big Tariffs whereas the US makes it easy for French wines and charges very small Tariffs Not fair must change
Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the US China and Russia But it was Germany in World Wars One  Two How did that work out for France They were starting to learn German in Paris before the US came along Pay for NATO or not

The prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches
The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere and many ballots are missing or forged An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected Must go with Election Night
of money spent on protecting other countries and we get nothing but Trade Deficits and Losses It is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection or protect themselvesand Trade must be made FREE and FAIR
hundreds of billions of dollars for the great privilege of losing hundreds of billions of dollars with these same countries on trade I told them that this situation cannot continue It is and always has been ridiculously unfair to the United States Massive amounts
Just returned from France where much was accomplished in my meetings with World Leaders Never easy bringing up the fact that the US must be treated fairly which it hasn’t on both Military and Trade We pay for LARGE portions of other countries military protection

These California fires are expanding very very quickly (in some cases 80-100 acres a minute) If people don’t evacuate quickly they risk being overtaken by the fire Please listen to evacuation orders from State and local officials
More than 4000 are fighting the Camp and Woolsey Fires in California that have burned over 170000 acres Our hearts are with those fighting the fires the 52000 who have evacuated and the families of the 11 who have died The destruction is catastrophic God Bless them all

Happy 243rd Birthday to our GREAT US Marine Corps🇺🇸 
I am in Paris getting ready to celebrate the end of World War One Is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war in particular that one which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time
There is no reason for these massive deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor Billions of dollars are given each year with so many lives lost all because of gross mismanagement of the forests Remedy now or no more Fed payments
Mr Whitaker is very highly thought of by  Senator  Ambassador  Leonard Leo of Federalist Society and many more I feel certain he will make an outstanding Acting Attorney General
Matthew G Whitaker is a highly respected former US Attorney from Iowa He was chosen by Jeff Sessions to be his Chief of Staff I did not know Mr Whitaker Likewise as Chief I did not know Mr Whitaker except primarily as he traveled with AG Sessions No social contact
President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US China and Russia Very insulting but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO which the US subsidizes greatly
Just out  in Arizona SIGNATURES DON’T MATCH Electoral corruption Call for a new Election We must protect our Democracy
Thank you  for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to Election Theft in Broward and Palm Beach Counties The WORLD is now watching closely
In the 2016 Election I was winning by so much in Florida that Broward County which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a number couldn’t do it because not enough people live in Broward for them to falsify a victory
Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him back into play Bill Nelson conceded Election now he’s back in play This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy
Rick Scott was up by 50000+ votes on Election Day now they found many votes and he is only up 15000 votes The Broward Effect How come they never find Republican votes
Jeff Flake(y) doesn’t want to protect the Non-Senate confirmed Special Counsel he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in Arizona for the crime of doing a terrible job A weak and ineffective guy
As soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer Marc Elias to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes Don’t worry Florida I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD
You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia  but the Election was on Tuesday Let’s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin
 ran a great race in Georgia  he won It is time to move on

According to NBC News Voters Nationwide Disapprove of the so-called Mueller Investigation (46percent) more than they Approve (41percent) You mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting Witch Hunt led by 17 Angry Democrats is all about
In all fairness Nancy Pelosi deserves to be chosen Speaker of the House by the Democrats If they give her a hard time perhaps we will add some Republican votes She has earned this great honor
If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information and much else at the Senate level Two can play that game
To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election just remember two words FAKE NEWS

unbelievably lucky to have him and I’m just awed at how well they’ve done It’s all the Trump magic Trump is the magic man Incredible he’s got the entire media against him attacking him every day and he pulls out these enormous wins Ben Stein The Capitalist Code
There’s only been 5 times in the last 105 years that an incumbent President has won seats in the Senate in the off year election Mr Trump has magic about him This guy has magic coming out of his ears He is an astonishing vote getter  campaigner The Republicans are

Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship something he knows nothing about Our new Republican Majority will work on this Closing the Immigration Loopholes and Securing our Border

Harry Reid was right in 1993 before he and the Democrats went insane and started with the Open Borders (which brings massive Crime) stuff Don’t forget the nasty term Anchor Babies I will keep our Country safe This case will be settled by the United States Supreme Court

So Revealing 
I will be interviewed by Laura Ingraham  tonight at 10:00 PM on 
Check out tweets from last two days I refer to Fake News Media when mentioning Enemy of the People but dishonest reporters use only the word Media The people of our Great Country are angry and disillusioned at receiving so much Fake News They get it and fully understand
CNN and others in the Fake News Business keep purposely and inaccurately reporting that I said the Media is the Enemy of the People Wrong I said that the Fake News (Media) is the Enemy of the People a very big difference When you give out false information not good
Great job being done by Congressman Keith Rothfus of Pennsylvania Thank you Keith

There is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news The Fake News Media the true Enemy of the People must stop the open  obvious hostility  report the news accurately  fairly That will do much to put out the flame
The Fake News is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans Conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our Country Actually it is their Fake  Dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand
Just watched Wacky Tom Steyer who I have not seen in action before be interviewed by  He comes off as a crazed  stumbling lunatic who should be running out of money pretty soon As bad as their field is if he is running for President the Dems will eat him alive

Events in Pittsburgh are far more devastating than originally thought Spoke with Mayor and Governor to inform them that the Federal Government has been and will be with them all the way I will speak to the media shortly and make further statement at Future Farmers of America
Watching the events unfolding in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Law enforcement on the scene People in Squirrel Hill area should remain sheltered Looks like multiple fatalities Beware of active shooter God Bless All

A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description Mainstream Media must clean up its act FAST
Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council is right when he says on  that the Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the Border MUST BE CHANDED but I am bringing out the military for this National Emergency They will be stopped
