Little Marco Rubio the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician 
Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21 2012 and then only after being humiliated by Harry R A bad messenger for estab

 was just banned by  their loss Tough loyal guy
I started my business with very little and built it into a great company with some of the best real estate assets in the World Amazing
I only wish my wonderful father Fred gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says He didn't total fabrication
Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version amazing people
I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz
Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit After the audit no problem

Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night The problem is he is a choker and once a choker always a choker Mr Meltdown
Wow every poll said I won the debate last night Great honor
Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage Not presidential material
Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement They failed

Why would Texans vote for liar Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently
When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win
Mitt Romneywho totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool is now playing tough guy
The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters That is how I got to 46percent When others drop out I will pick up more  Sad but true

Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again The Evangelicals in SC figured him out  said no
Ted Cruz does not have the right temperment to be President Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm BAD
Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog Ted panicked
Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in SC He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration

Just saw the phony ad by Cruz totally false more dirty tricks He got caught in so many lies is this man crazy
Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks No wonder he has lost Evangelical support
Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false no basis in fact Take ad down Ted Biggest liar in politics
Wow Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director More dirty tricks
It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done
Thank you for your endorsement    Video  
Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry
I hear the Rickets family who own the Chicago Cubs are secretly spending $'s against me They better be careful they have a lot to hide
The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in SC is because he is a world class LIAR and Evangelicals do not like liars
I am in Las Vegas at the best hotel (by far) Trump International I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada

Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in Don't allow it
I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque Very sad that he did not go
I am the only candidate (in many years) who is self-funding his campaign Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates
Lying  Cruz just (on election day) came out with a sneak and sleazy Robocall He holds up the Bible but in fact is a true lowlife pol

Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses He wants to look cool but it's far too late 1percent in Nevada
Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1percent he should take his dumb mouthpiece  and just go home
 is so biased it is disgusting They do not want Trump to win All negative
I will beat Hillary easily but Lindsey Graham says I won't and yet he got zero against me- no cred Why does FOX put him on
 who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on 
Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I would never be president This from perhaps the worst president in US history
Why does  devote so much time on her shows to me almost always negative  Without me her ratings would tank Get a life Megyn
Thank you   for your nice words great knowledge and style We are doing really well in South Carolina  
 thinks that when Republicans drop out of the race someone will pick up ALL of that vote The fact is I will get much of it
Explain to  and  who know nothing that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem-indie votes) that no other R can

RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ  
JEB is a hypocrite Used massive private Eminent Domain --- Just another clueless politician 
Jeb used Eminent Domain  took advantage of a disabled vet in the process (2/2)
I'd like to call JEB a liar but the truth is he has no clue  never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me (1/2)
Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb() is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center Iraq War and eco collapse Careful
I will be in South Carolina all week Saturday is BIG BIG BIG Get out and vote MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates Hillary would destroy them Ted may not be eligible to run born in Canada
Funny that Jeb() didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last nameThen mommy now brother
Ted Cruz along with Jeb Bush pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice but didn't
Wow in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties Thank you
Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists  special interests the bosses
Loved the debate last night and almost everyone said I won but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution All donors  special ints
Thank you for your support TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  
I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning Enjoy

Even though every poll Time Drudge etc has me winning the debate by a lot  only puts negative people on Biased a total joke
  
Hey  see how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll Your endorsement means nothing 
 
All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge TIME etc Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty He has zero cred- totally dishonest
How can  beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the  stage with $150M I am the only one who can

Millions of $'s of false ads  paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater   and sleepy  are now running in SC
Last time lightweight  tried to knock off  he made a total fool of himself If he doesn't do better this time he is out
If  doesn’t clean up his act stop cheating  doing negative ads I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen
Lightweight  is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC False advertising- desperate and sad
After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect  ill-informed ads
Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution which naturally they did not get
You must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary //tco/lPuprzJBQ5

Jeb Bush spent more than $40000000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5 I spent $3000000 to come in 1st Big difference in capability
There are no buyers for the worthless  but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking It is bleeding red ink a total loser

Politicians are trying to chip away at the 2nd Amendment I won’t let them take away our guns  
This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone a misdemeanor at minimum 
  as per the show an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone
    discuss what Ted Cruz did to the great people of Iowa- as they went to vote 
Thank you    Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa with each candidate moving up one notch
Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me He would be so easy to beat
THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock Arkansas tonight A record crowd of 12K  
Stop the assault on American values Stand w/ Trump to   
Thank you New Hampshire   
Dr Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies
Cruz just lied again- I am and have been totally against  repeal and replace
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud
This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote  
I will be interviewed on  at 7:00 PM Enjoy 
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified
And finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and choice a total lie
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz Fraud
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus Cruz put out a release that  was quitting the race and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa he stole it That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated Bad
Great job on  tonight    begged us for a job We said no and she went hostile A real dummy 
On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd    
Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment
   on  He finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro
I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one I will keep doing but not worth it
I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire Big crowd
The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history
Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa I spent very little there a fraction of Cruz  Rubio Came in a strong second Great honor
My experience in Iowa was a great one I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place Nice
It all begins today WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Join us  WATERLOO  CEDER RAPIDS

If I would have done the last debate a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved) Also VETS got $6000000
By not doing the failed poorly rated debate I was able to make the point of not allowing unfairness while raising $6000000 for VETS
Wow just saw an ad Cruz is lying on so many levels There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me will repeal  replace He lies
Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form Very low interest loans scam

A wonderful article by a writer who truly gets it I am for the people and the people are for me  
Is Cruz honest He is in bed w/ Wall St  is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi low interest loans No legal disclosure  never sold off assets
Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for  He could be Canadian Prime Minister
Cruz says I supported TARP which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose Puppet
The only reason irrelevant  doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show asked many times Very few listeners sad
 one of the National Review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog Why doesn't he say that
Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin

Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about  demeaning 
Wow Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul  $1M low int loan from Goldman Sachs Hypocrite
Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm Thank you  
Greatly dishonest of  to file a financial disclosure form  not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St
When will  give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him
Everybody that loves the people of New York and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics
If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage
Ted is the ultimate hypocrite Says one thing for money does another for votes 
Great new numbers Thank you   
Ted Cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks They own him
Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a natural born Canadian did he borrow unreported loans from C banks
Oh no just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan this one from Citi Wow no wonder banks do so well in the US Senate
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace Remember his wife's employer and his lender is located there
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file Goldman Sachs owns him he will do anything they demand Not much of a reformer
Ted Cruz said he didn't know that he was a Canadian Citizen He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papersNot believable
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow I told you so

I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women
Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president Jeb Bush is a low energy individual but Hillary is not much better
Hillary Clinton said that it is OK to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL but not OK to do so in the US We must be vigilant
 is a low energy stiff who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls Has no chance
 is a sad case A total embarrassment to both himself and his family he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads

We need a real President 
Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs Iowa later today Despite weather rally is on -- will be fantastic 
So I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place Jeb Bush has spent $59 million  done Run country my way
My campaign for president is $35000000 under budget I have spent very little (and am in 1st place)Now I will spend big in Iowa/NH/SC
Minorities line up behindDonald Trump    
 is terrific at hosting on  he really gets it
Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008 He was terrible failed badly and was called a racist
Thank you- Nashua New Hampshire      
Thank you   
Thank you to a  supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months Video 
Strange but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes while he will double  triple them a disaster
Wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few  and people have lost faith in our leadersWe need smart and strong leadership now
Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries We now are part time sad I WILL FIX
The middle-class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of and no  effective raise in years BAD
If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women's card on me she's wrong
Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party FAST
Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late Stupid  RNC
 blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that I feel wages in America are too high Lie
The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory The Dems LOVE IT Be smart and win for a change
RPVirginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row Will now not allow desperately needed new voters Suicidal mistake RNC MUST ACT NOW
It begins Republican Party of Virginia controlled by the RNC is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters BAD
I will do far more for women than Hillary and I will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina
Thank you  
Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM so inappropriate
A new terror warning was issued for European cties At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart Weak leaders
  Story  
Criminal deportations in the US are the lowest number in many years We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country MUST CHANGE
The Phoenix VA it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before The wait is horrendous and people are dying I will fix it
The same people that said I wouldn't run or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21percent) now say I won't beat Hillary
 is so dishonest in his reportingand to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings I will beat Hillary
 just announced that TRUMP was  story of 2015 Totally meaningless however if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again
When will the Democrats and Hillary in particular say we must build a wall a great wall and Mexico is going to pay for it Never
Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the VA That will stop I will fix this quickly
Remember when failed candidate  said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE He's spent $59 million and is at 3percent
We have many problems in our house (country) and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally Politics
 was GREAT today on   She gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly Have her on more
Merry Christmas to all Have a great day and have a really amazing year Together we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN It will be done
  Great job on  today Very wise indeed
 Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video Bad reporting Perhaps  will do better next year-but doubt it
I am now in Palm Beach Florida and will be going to church tonight MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
 and  very dishonest in not showing the new  Poll where I am at 39percent 21points higher than Cruz Be honest Chuck
Why isn't  using the much newer  Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll CNN even better
Wow because of the pressure put on by me ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS It's about time
Next year will be an interesting one I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly
Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing  are totally in the Hillary circle of bias Think about Bill
Wow even lowly Rand Paul has just past  in the new  Poll Jeb is at 3percent I'm at 39percent Stop throwing your money down the drain
In the ridiculous  ad about me Jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn't allow my answer which destroys him SO SAD
Poor  spent $50 million on his campaign I spent almost nothing He's bottom (and gone) I'm top (by a lot) That's what US needs
A great Christmas movie  perfect   Story  
Hillary said I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity
Merry Christmas  Happy Holidays  
Hillary when you complain about a penchant for sexism who are you referring to I have great respect for women BE CAREFUL
It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media  New  Poll amazing in ALL categories 21 pt Lead
Why does  give  so much airtime He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased Still thinks Romney won Unfair coverage of Trump
 treats me so badly Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out  Poll All negative
The  which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on  today did a nasty cartoon attacking  kids Bad
The silent majority- is silent no more Remember the importance of VOTING  
The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card
  
Thank you America Together- we will  
Big news just out NEW  POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category Likeability way up CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10
We need a PRESIDENT with strength stamina heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again
It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong Sad
When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama it meant got beaten badly The media knows this Often used word in politics
  
Wow new Reuters Poll just out Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge
For those on TV defending my use of the word schlonged bc  is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly Dishonest 
NPR's  said schlonged to WaPo re 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls 
Once again  is dishonest Schlonged is not vulgar When I said Hillary got schlonged that meant beaten badly
Jeb's big ad buy against me paid for by lobbyists shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements He is really pathetic
Watching  and consider  to be one of the least talented people on television Boring and biased
Women defy media narrative love Trump at packed Michigan rallyVIDEO  
 opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around incoherent
Why doesn't  in his ads show my answer to his statement in the debate
Will  in his phony advertising campaign show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate
 just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy Will never work
Weak and low energy  whose campaign is a disaster is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy
Video from Michigan last night After asking for months the media panned their cameras  
THANK YOU America   
Thank you Michigan  
Thank you New Hampshire  
THANK YOU Grand Rapids Michigan Time to end political correctness  secure our homeland  
 thanks for your support- it is very much appreciated
Getting ready to leave for Michigan will be an amazing evening See you there
Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about the video of me being used by ISIS There is no video
Thanks  for all of your kind words and thoughts Big progress is being made Keep up the great work
A suicide bomber has just killed US troops in Afghanistan When will our leaders get tough and smart We are being led to slaughter
It's the Democrats' total weakness  incompetence that gave rise to ISIS --  not a tape of Donald Trump that was an admitted Hillary lie
Phyllis Schlafly Trump is 'last hope for America'  
Getting ready to go to the great State of Michigan Big crowd tonight Make America Great Again
Just out TRUMP GOP DEBATE 18000000 CLINTON DEMOCRAT DEBATE 6700000 And they were on major network vs cable
Hillary said with respect to ISIS we are finally where we need to be Do we want 4  more years of incompetent leadership  MAGA
I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate There never was a video
Hillary said at debate ISIS is going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst She made up story-want apology
Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant I sold it 6 months ago for a record price This would never have happened
 today said he didn't want to be the front-runner he would rather be where he is now 2percent That is the talk of a loser can't win
Great poll out of Illinois Thank you  
 final 3 on now Great people great new owner  WATCH
My friend  of  bought the Miss Universe pageants from me and they are on tonight on  Tune in
It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night Not very presidential
Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me Therefore Hillary LIED at the debate last night SAD
 was terrible on Face The Nation today Being at 2percent and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence A basket case
We need a  with great strength  stamina Hillary does not have that  
Hillary Clinton lied when she said that ISIS is using video of Donald Trump as a recruiting tool This was fact checked by  FALSE
 stupidly believes that Hillary wants to run against me because she said so She says that so people believe it opposite
  
Thank you America  post-debate poll with +/- from previous poll   
Thank you Cedar Rapids Iowa  
President Obama spends so much time speaking of the so-called Carbon footprint and yet he flies all the way to Hawaii on a massive old 747
See Sanders backed Hillary on E-mails at the debate hurting himself and then she threw him under the bus (but failed) Disloyal person
Another new post-debate poll THANK YOU   
Thank you for all of your support Most importantly we need to get everyone out to VOTE  
The last thing our country needs is another BUSH Dumb as a rock
 has embarrassed himself  his family with his incompetent campaign for President He should remain true to himself
  
Weak  ineffective  is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response False advertising
I have an idea for  whose campaign is a disaster Try using your last name  don’t be ashamed of it
  Don’t misrepresent in order to make a point I was always tough on ISIS--as you’ll find out after I get elected
As I have been saying Only the beginning ISIS Suspects Arrested in Turkey 150 European Passports Seized

 the most overrated anchor at  worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead She said 15
Why isn't anyone using the  Iowa Poll with me having a big lead They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place)Dishonest press
Isn't it amazing that  paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll which shows me in first place over Cruz by 13percent 33percent to 20percent then doesn't use it
Wow I just had two very good Iowa polls and a phenomenal just out National Poll from   38percent  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
