cruz- as iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote   i will be interviewed on  at 7:00 pm enjoy  based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified and finally cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers voters that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and choice a total lie the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting votergrade of f and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz fraud many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud also cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters during primetime of the iowa caucus cruz put out a release that  was quitting the race and to caucus or vote for cruz ted cruz didn't win iowa he stole it that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated bad great job on  tonight    begged us for a job we said no and she went hostile a real dummy  on my way to new hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd     anybody who watched all of ted cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his howard dean moment    on  he finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro i don't believe i have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one i will keep doing but not worth it i will be talking about my wonderful experience in iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in new hampshire big crowd the media has not covered my long-shot great finish in iowa fairly

one thing for money does another for votes  great new numbers thank you    ted cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks they own him based on the fact that ted cruz was born in canada and is therefore a natural born canadian did he borrow unreported loans from c banks oh no just reported that ted cruz didn't report another loan this one from citi wow no wonder banks do so well in the us senate the ted cruz wiseguy apology to the people of new york is a disgrace remember his wife's employer and his lender is located there was

voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how hillary abused those women hillary clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president jeb bush is a low energy individual but hillary is not much better hillary clinton said that it is ok to ban muslims from israel by building a wall but not ok to do so in the us we must be vigilant  is a low energy stiff who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls has no chance  is a sad case a total embarrassment to both himself and his family he just announced he will continue to spend on trump hit

happy birthday to my son  very proud of you    i would feel sorry for  and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me    people ask why do

at the top win   a great day in south carolina record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm this is now a movement to make america great again i predict that dying  newspaper which has been run into the

  i'm going to be live with  and  to ring in the new year 2016 everybody should tune in to  tomorrow night thank you hilton head south carolina    thank you hilton head south carolina     i never thought i'd be saying this but i've really enjoyed   on television lately and he was terrific hosting  joe mcquaid  is desperately trying to sell the  it's a loser and my comments haven't helped him much the dying  newspaper in nh is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out iowa was fantastic last night amazing crowd and people i'm now in florida getting ready to go to south carolina big crowd very exciting    you were great on  last night thanks for the nice words make america great again thank you council bluffs iowa the silent majority is silent no more    joe mcquaid  of the dying union leader wanted ads lunches donations speeches from me and tweets---very unethical the great people of new hampshire who i love are not properly served by the dying union leader newspaper shows how dumb joe mcquaid  of the dying union leader is to put out the letter i wrote saying why i didn't do his failed debate i hope  does better for rubio than he did at the  hearings which were a total disaster for republicans  america we need a real president  looking forward to being in council bluffs iowa later today despite weather rally is on -- will be fantastic  so i have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place jeb bush has spent $59 million  done run country my way my campaign for president is $35000000 under budget i have spent very little and am in 1st placenow i will spend big in iowa/nh/sc minorities line up behinddonald trump      is terrific at hosting on  he really gets it remember that bill clinton was brought in to help hillary against obama in 2008 he was terrible failed badly and was called a racist thank you- nashua new hampshire       thank you    thank you to a  supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months video  strange but i see wacko bernie sanders allies coming over to me because i'm lowering taxes while he will double  triple them a disaster wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few  and people have lost faith in our leaderswe need smart and strong leadership now many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries we now are part time sad i will fix the middle-class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of and no  effective raise in years bad if hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women's card on me she's wrong hopefully the republican national committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in virginia's republican party fast straighten out the republican party of virginia before it is too late stupid  rnc  blew his campaign when he gave hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that i feel wages in america are too high lie the voters the republican party of virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory the dems love it be smart and win for a change rpvirginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row will now not allow desperately needed new voters suicidal mistake rnc must act now it begins republican party of virginia controlled by the rnc is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters bad i will do far more for women than hillary and i will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina thank you   hillary clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but he's demonstrated a penchant for sexism so inappropriate a new terror warning was issued for european cties at what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart weak leaders   story   criminal deportations in the us are the lowest number in many years we are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country must change the phoenix va it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before the wait is horrendous and people are dying i will fix it the same people that said i wouldn't run or that i wouldn't lead or do well 1st place and leading by 21percent now say i won't beat hillary  is so dishonest in his reportingand to think he was going off the air until i came along-no ratings i will beat hillary  just announced that trump was  story of 2015 totally meaningless however if we don't win it all and make america great again when will the democrats and hillary in particular say we must build a wall a great wall and mexico is going to pay for it never our great veterans are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the va that will stop i will fix this quickly remember when failed candidate  said that illegals came across the border as an act of love he's spent $59 million and is at 3percent we have many problems in our house country and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay make america great again does everyone see that the democrats and president obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally politics  was great today on   she gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly have her on more merry christmas to all have a great day and have a really amazing year together we will make america great again it will be done   great job on  today very wise indeed  why didn't you report hillary lying about the isis video bad reporting perhaps  will do better next year-but doubt it i am now in palm beach florida and will be going to church tonight make america great again  and  very dishonest in not showing the new  poll where i am at 39percent 21points higher than cruz be honest chuck why isn't  using the much newer  poll when discussing how well i am doing instead of the older q poll cnn even better wow because of the pressure put on by me ice to launch large scale deportation raids it's about time next year will be an interesting one i look forward to running against hillary clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly third rate reporters amy chozick and maggie haberman of the failing  are totally in the hillary circle of bias think about bill wow even lowly rand paul has just past  in the new  poll jeb is at 3percent i'm at 39percent stop throwing your money down the drain in the ridiculous  ad about me jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn't allow my answer which destroys him so sad poor  spent $50 million on his campaign i spent almost nothing he's bottom and gone i'm top by a lot that's what us needs a great christmas movie  perfect   story   hillary said i really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign i deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity merry christmas  happy holidays   hillary when you complain about a penchant for sexism who are you referring to i have great respect for women be careful it is hard to believe i am winning by so much when i am treated so badly by the media  new  poll amazing in all categories 21 pt lead why does  give  so much airtime he and other fox pundits is so biased still thinks romney won unfair coverage of trump  treats me so badly using old quinnipiac poll where i have a much smaller lead than the just out  poll all negative the  which is the lobbyist power for not imposing taxes on  today did a nasty cartoon attacking  kids bad the silent majority- is silent no more remember the importance of voting   the hillary clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic be careful hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card    thank you america together- we will   big news just out new  poll  trump  39 and leads in every major category likeability way up cruz 18  carson 10  rubio 10 we need a president with strength stamina heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again it is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong sad when i said that hillary clinton got schlonged by obama it meant got beaten badly the media knows this often used word in politics    wow new reuters poll just out big lead if you want to make america great again  trump 37  cruz 11 this is at the top of drudge for those on tv defending my use of the word schlonged bc  is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly dishonest  npr's  said schlonged to wapo re 1984 mondale/ferraro campaign that ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls  once again  is dishonest schlonged is not vulgar when i said hillary got schlonged that meant beaten badly jeb's big ad buy against me paid for by lobbyists shows my face but doesn't have me answering jeb's statements he is really pathetic watching  and consider  to be one of the least talented people on television boring and biased women defy media narrative love trump at packed michigan rallyvideo    opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around incoherent why doesn't  in his ads show my answer to his statement in the debate will  in his phony advertising campaign show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate  just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy will never work weak and low energy  whose campaign is a disaster is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy video from michigan last

debate isis is going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst she made up story-want apology very sad what happened last night at the miss universe pageant i sold it 6

hillary clinton lied when she said that isis is using video of donald trump as a recruiting tool this was fact checked by  false  stupidly believes that hillary wants to run against me because she said so she says that so people believe it opposite    thank you america  post-debate poll with +/- from previous poll    thank you cedar rapids iowa   president obama spends so much time speaking of
