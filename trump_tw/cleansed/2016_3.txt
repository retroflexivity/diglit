donald trump is already helping the working class'  president-elect donald j trump today announced his intent to nominate steven mnuchin wilbur ross  todd ricketts  join me in cincinnati ohio tomorrow evening at 7:00pm i am grateful for all of your support thank youtickets:  hence legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations the presidency is a far more important task do this under the law i feel it is visually important as president  to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to make america great again while i am not mandated to  i will be holding a major news conference in new york city with my children on december 15 to discuss the fact that i will be leaving my  isis is taking credit for the terrible stabbing attack at ohio state university by a somali refugee who should not have been in our country big day on thursday for indiana and the great workers of that wonderful statewe will keep our companies and jobs in the us thanks carrier i will be going to indiana on thursday to make a major announcement concerning carrier ac staying in indianapolis great deal for workers president-elect donald j trump nominates elaine chao as secretary of the department of transportation' president-elect donald j trump intends to nominate congressman tom price and seema verma'  my thoughts and prayers are with the great people of tennessee during these terrible wildfires stay safe nobody should be allowed to burn the american flag if they do there must be consequences perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail i thought that  would get better after they failed so badly in their support of hillary clinton however since election they are worse the great state of michigan was just certified as a trump win giving all of our make america great again supporters another victory 306  is so embarrassed by their total  100percent support of hillary clinton and yet her loss in a landslide that they don't know what to do just met with general petraeus--was very impressed if cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the cuban people the cuban/american people and the us as a whole i will terminate deal serious voter fraud in virginia new hampshire and california so why isn't the media reporting on this serious bias big problem states instead of the 15 states that i visited i would have won even more easily and convincingly but smaller states are forgotten it would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the electoral college in that i would only campaign in 3 or 4-- in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally trump is going to be our president we owe him an open mind and the chance to lead so much time and money will be spent same result sad this election that is a direct threat to our democracy she then said we have to accept the results and look to the future donald -- of position then separately she stated he said something truly horrifying  he refused to say that he would respect the results of -- during a general election i for one am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind -- and fair elections we've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a - hillary's debate answer on delay that is horrifying that is not the way our democracy works been around for 240 years we've had free -- hillary clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in nothing will change the democrats when they incorrectly thought they were going to win asked that the election night tabulation be accepted not so anymore the green party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated  demoralized dems fidel castro is dead i am working hard even on thanksgiving trying to get carrier ac company to stay in the us indiana making progress will know soon happy thanksgiving to everyone we will together make america great again let us give thanks for all that we have and let us boldly face the exciting new frontiers that lie ahead happy th  bus crash in tennessee so sad  so terrible condolences to all family members and loved ones these beautiful children will be remembered i am seriously considering dr ben carson as the head of hud i've gotten to know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people the meeting with the  is back on at 12:30 today look forward to it jeff sessions a fitting selection for attorney general' president-elect donald j trump's cia director garners praise'  great meetings will take place today at trump tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years the failing  just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high i can fully understand that but why announce perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the  in the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone i cancelled today's meeting with the failing  when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment not nice many people would like to see  represent great britain as their ambassador to the united states he would do a great job prior to the election it was well known that i have interests in properties all over the worldonly the crooked media makes this a big deal  update and policy plans for the first 100 days  i have always had a good relationship with chuck schumer he is far smarter than harry r and has the ability to get things done good news general james mad dog mattis who is being considered for secretary of defense was very impressive yesterday a true general's general i watched parts of  saturday night live last night it is a totally one-sided biased show nothing funny at all equal time for us numerous patriots will be coming to bedminster today as i continue to fill out the various positions necessary to make america great again the cast and producers of hamilton which i hear is highly overrated should immediately apologize to mike pence for their terrible behavior the theater must always be a safe and special placethe cast of hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man mike pence apologize our wonderful future vp mike pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of hamilton cameras blazingthis should not happen the only bad thing about winning the presidency is that i did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on trump u too bad i settled the trump university lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as president i have to focus on our country will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to make america great again i worked hard with bill ford to keep the lincoln plant in kentucky i owed it to the great state of kentucky for their confidence in me just got a call from my friend bill ford chairman of ford who advised me that he will be keeping the lincoln plant in kentucky no mexico my transition team which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job will be seeing many great candidates today  australia new zealand and more i am always available to them  is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me i have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing  said russia uk china saudi arabia japan the failing  story is so totally wrong on transition it is going so smoothly also i have spoken to many foreign leaders i am not trying to get top level security clearance for my children this was a typically false news story very organized process taking place as i decide on cabinet and many other positions i am the only one who knows who the finalists are the electoral college is actually genius in that it brings all states including the smaller ones into play campaigning is much different if the election were based on total popular vote i would have campaigned in  ny florida and california and won even bigger and more easily the debates especially the second and third plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies plus our great supporters gave us the win i will be interviewed on  tonight after the nfl game 7:00 pm enjoy the  states today that djt believes more countries should acquire nuclear weapons how dishonest are they i never said this governor john kasich of the great great great state of ohio called to congratulate me on the win the people of ohio were incredible jeb bush george w
