So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave It was my great honor they do an amazing job
Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5600000 that I raised/gave
I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so Watch
So many great things happening new poll numbers looking good News conference at 11:00 AM today Trump Tower
I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge Gonzalo Curiel who is totally biased against me
I have a judge in the Trump University civil case Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego) who is very unfair An Obama pick Totally biased-hates Trump
I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day
I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent instead of sixteen Broke record
Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
The endorsement of me by the 16500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate Nice
In getting the endorsement of the 16500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you) the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary
Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at WH
If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent say good bye to the Supreme Court
The Republican Party has to be smart  strong if it wants to win in November Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate
Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser but if the GOP can't control their own then they are not a party Be tough R's
Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100percent behind everything we do
Heading to DC to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY Great spirit
Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country We love them
Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan Thousands of American lives lost 
Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign The only quote that matters is a quote from me
I am always on the front page of the failing  but when I won the GOP nomination I'm in the back of the paper Very dishonest
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style I spend much less money  get much better results What we need as Prez
The failing  wrote a story about my management style  that I don't have many people I have 73 Hillary has 800-  I'm beating her
I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary by a lot and with many states left to go Thank you
The US has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders How nice but what do we get NOT ENOUGH
Great rally in Fresno California- great crowd Thank you

Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates Hillary doesn't have it
Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren  has done less in the US Senate than practically any other senator All talk no action
  Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes known as Pocahontas bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing Total hypocrite
 Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas because she faked the fact she is native American is a lowlife
Great rally in New Mexico amazing crowd Now in LA Big rally in Anaheim

Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs Most importantly she suffers from plain old bad judgement
I just released my financial disclosure forms the largest numbers in the history of the FEC Even the dishonest media thinks great
Amazingly with all of the money I have raised for the vets I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media
Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups
While under no obligation to do so I have raised between 5  6 million dollars including 1million dollars from me for our VETERANS Nice
Join me in California or Montana5/25/16 Anaheim California/26/16 Billings Montana

What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly and for years trying to come back I said no

In politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in US history
The writer of the now proven false story in the  Michael Barbaro who was interviewed on CBS this morning was unable to respond
Over 50 women were interviewed by the  yet they only wrote about 6 That’s because there were so many positive statements
No wonder the  is failingwho can believe what they write after the false malicious  libelous story they did on me
The failing  is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women
Rowanne Brewer the most prominently depicted woman in the failing  story yesterday joined

Why doesn't the failing  write the real story on the Clintons and women The media is TOTALLY dishonest
Everyone is laughing at the  for the lame hit piece they did on me and womenI gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use
The failing  wrote yet another hit piece on me All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women they found nothing A joke

Isn’t it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump  gets nothing done in Senate
Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage See mediaasking for increase
Our Native American Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren couldn’t care less about the American workerdoes nothing to help
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked Hillary See her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you
If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been she would lose
Thanks Piers 
  
Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn’t have the guts to run for POTUS Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold
Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire US Senate She has done nothing

Get out and vote West Virginia we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Thank you Jason Greenblatt  For Our Children Let's Elect Donald Trump  
I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current
I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people
If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did
Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump But I had 17 people to beatshe had one

Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy
Goofy Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clinton’s flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie She is not Native American
Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American I say she’s a fraud
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate I will defeat them both
Response to

Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him Typical politician can't make a deal work
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one Shows weakness
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate Their donors  special interest groups are not happy with them Sad
Wow just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination DESPERATION
I am happy to hear how badly the  is doing It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down Becoming irrelevant

Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race He said Kasich should get out for same reason I think both should get out
I will be doing the  with my wife Melania and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall Hopefully it will be fun Enjoy7AM

Trump defends campaign manager charged for bruising a reporter
Thank you  
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference What is in her hand 
This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility she changed her tune 
Victory press conference was over Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions Can I press charges 
Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened that is before she found out the episode was on tape
Wow Corey Lewandowski my campaign manager and a very decent man was just charged with assaulting a reporter Look at tapes-nothing there
How come the    show the new  Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz
I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC
Wow  has nothing but my opponents on their shows Really one-sided and unfair reporting Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight
We need to secure our borders ASAP No games we must be smart tough and vigilant MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN
Lyin' Ted I have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates You should focus on jobs  illegal imm
Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak  losing big so now he wants to debate again But according to DrudgeTime and on-line polls I have won all debates
After the way I beat Gov Scott Walker (and Jeb Rand Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries no way he would ever endorse me
Just released that international gangs are all over our cities This will end when I am President
Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE a must
A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American When will our so-called leaders ever learn
Kirsten Powers Anti- Trump Operative was Aggressively Shopping Cruz Story via the Gateway Pundit 
I will be interviewed on  at 7:30 Things are looking good had a great Easter-look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin
The United States cannot continue to make such bad one-sided trade deals There are only so many jobs we can give up No more
See Lyin' Ted even the  (no fan of mine) says this story came from Rubio not Trump 
Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming
Why can't the pundits be honest Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again I will make it strong and great  JOBS
Another radical Islamic attack this time in Pakistan targeting Christian women  children At least 67 dead400 injured I alone can solve
Happy Easter to all have a great day
My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the US are now finally receiving plaudits
Wow sleepy eyes  is at it again He is do totally biased The things I am saying are correct far better vision than the others
I am interviewed on This Week on  this morning Enjoy
Remember I am the only candidate who is self-funding While I am given little credit for this by the voters I am not bought like others
Don't believe the  Polls they are just another phony hit job on me I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election
Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in US jobs are leaving I will make our economy strong again bring in jobs
Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J Trump Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong Illegals out
Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enqwere caused by me I had NOTHING to do with story
The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite
The media is so after me on women  Wow this is a tough business Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump
Top suspect in Paris massacre Salah Abdeslam who also knew of the Brussels attack is no longer talking Weak leaders ridiculous laws
Wow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me How am I still number one by a lot
I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania he did He knew the PAC was putting it out hence Lyin' Ted
Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it If I lost-monster story
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Endorsements for Lyin' Ted Cruz- 
Europe and the US must immediately stop taking in people from Syria This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it So sad
Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe Also many in US  I TOLD YOU SO I alone can fix this problem
Explain how the women on The View which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left ever got their jobs  is wasting time
 TV show which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on I TELL THEM NO
Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE AND FAST
It is amazing how often I am right only to be criticized by the media Illegal immigration take the oil build the wall Muslims NATO
Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing  wrote a critical article I was so right
These politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better
 and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike ALL TALK AND NO ACTION Both talk about ISIS do nothing
It is amazing how  gets on so many TV shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run
We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of NATO Why It is time to renegotiate and the time is now
NATO is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
I want to thank  for all of his help in our historic Arizona win Could not have done it without you Joe
While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race
I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted Jeb spent more than $150000000 and got nothing I spent a fraction of that and am first
I will be the best by far in fighting terror I’m the only one that was right from the beginning  now Lyin’ Ted  others are copying me
Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror She’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are
Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates Lyin’ Ted Cruz Honestly I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion
Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from Michael Douglas just another dishonest politician
Thank you Arizona   
Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the GQ model photo post of Melania That's why we call him Lyin' Ted
Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices
Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona Thank you I will never forget
Thank you Arizona   
Incompetent Hillary despite the horrible attack in Brussels today wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in  No way
Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a GQ shoot in his ad Be careful Lyin' Ted or I will spill the beans on your wife
Pres Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately  get home to Washington- where a  under a serious emergency belongs
Obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger Shame
 message from   
 message from    
 video      
My heart  prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible  tragedy This madness must be stopped and I will stop it
Watch this clip from earlier this year Time  time again I have been right about terrorism It’s time to get tough 
I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it’s not even close Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba especially in the shadows of Brussels He is being treated badly
Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was Not anymore it is from a different world US must be vigilant and smart
Wow President Obama just landed in Cuba a big deal and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him He greeted Pope and others No respect
Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach I will be there
So the highly overrated anchor  is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but I can't fight back Wrong
The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters

Thank you- New York I love you  
Landing in Phoenix now Tomorrow's events will be amazing 
Reading  of the NY Times is a total waste of time he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him- dummy

Heading to Phoneix Will be arriving soon Tomorrow a big day Tremendous crowds expected  
Watching  fantastic show Has very interesting take on Paul Ryan
Just leaving Salt Lake City Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions Love Utah- will be back

Everybody should boycott the  show Never worth watching Always a hit on Trump She is sick  the most overrated person on tv
Thank you Arizona- I love you   
Join me tomorrow  
Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue No wonder he lost
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich  Marco Rubio and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz 1/2
Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney the man who choked and let us all down is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz This is good for me
Going to Salt Lake City Utah for a big rally Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there Mormons don't like LIARS I beat Hillary
Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $100000000 from me Remember I said- NO 
Club For Growth tried to extort $1000000 from me When I said NO they went hostile with negative ads Disgraceful
With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up Can anyone explain this
 got fired like a dog from RedStateand now he is the one leading opposition against me
Senator  made horrible statements about   and then he endorsed him No wonder nobody trusts politicians

Join us in Salt Lake City Utah- tonight 
Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life

Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio Two more days and Ohio was mine
See you in Arizona on Friday and Saturday 
Please explain to the dummies at the   Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won according to Drudge etc all 11 of them
 is bad at math The good news is nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore especially me
 Editorial says Clinton primary vote total is 8646551Trump's is 7533692-a knock But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16Apologize
The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem
Crazy  is now complaining that   did not defend her against me yet her bad show is a total hit piece on meTough
Great news that  has cancelled the additional debate How many times can the same people ask the same question I beat Cruz debating
Crazy  supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse Ted can't win
Stuart Stevens the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump Sad

I will bring our jobs back to the US and keep our companies from leaving Nobody else can do it Our economy will sing again
In presidential voting so far John Kasich is ZERO for 22 So why would he be a good candidate Hillary would beat him I will beat Hillary
Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico now losing Ford (and many others) Kasich is weak on illegal immigration We need strong borders now
Watching John Kasich being interviewed acting so innocent and like such a nice guy Remember him in second debate until I put him down

Good morning Ohio Some additional information from my daughter    
Don't reward Mitt Romney who let us all down in the last presidential race by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA open borders etc)
Please remember I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign Kasich Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists
I will bring our jobs back to America fix our military and take care of our vets end Common Core and ObamaCare protect 2nd A build WALL
Rubio is weak on illegal immigration with the worst voting record in the US Senate in many years He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events Be careful Bernie or my supporters will go to yours
Wow Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania not enough signatures Big problem
USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage He has ties to ISIS Should be in jail 
Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core In other words education of your children from DC No way
   
Just finished my second speech 20K in Dayton  25K in Cleveland- perfectly behaved crowd Thanks- I love you Ohio 
It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago and then they say I must talk to my people Phony politicians
