charged with assaulting a reporter look at tapes-nothing there how come the    show the new  poll for hillary vs bernie but do not show the same poll where i am killing cruz i have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than cruz or kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the republican party or the rnc wow  has nothing but my opponents on their shows really one-sided and unfair reporting maybe i shouldn't do their town-hall tonight we need to secure our borders asap no games we must be smart tough and vigilant make america great again  make america strong again lyin' ted i have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates you should focus on jobs  illegal imm lyin'ted cruz is weak  losing big so now he wants to debate again but according to drudgetime and on-line polls i have won all debates after the way i beat gov scott walker and jeb rand marco and all others in the presidential primaries no way he would ever endorse me just released that international gangs are all over our cities this will end when i am president ted cruz is incensed that i want to refocus nato on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to pay fair share a must a detainee released from gitmo has killed an american when will our so-called leaders ever learn kirsten powers anti- trump operative was aggressively shopping cruz story via the gateway pundit  i will be interviewed on  at 7:30 things are looking good had a great easter-look forward to spending the week in wisconsin the united states cannot continue to make such bad one-sided trade deals there are only so many jobs we can give up no more see lyin' ted even the  no fan of mine says this story came from rubio not trump  just to show you how unfair republican primary politics can be i won the state of louisiana and get less delegates than cruz-lawsuit coming why can't the pundits be honest hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again i will make it strong and great  jobs another radical islamic attack this time in pakistan targeting christian women  children at least 67 dead400 injured i alone can solve happy easter to all have a great day my statement on nato being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive and unfair for the us are now finally receiving plaudits wow sleepy eyes  is at it again he is do totally biased the things i am saying are correct far better vision than the others i am interviewed on this week on  this morning enjoy remember i am the only candidate who is self-funding while i am given little credit for this by the voters i am not bought like others don't believe the  polls they are just another phony hit job on me i will beat hillary clinton easily in the general election wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in us jobs are leaving i will make our economy strong again bring in jobs nobody will protect our nation like donald j trump our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong illegals out lyin' ted cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with the national enqwere caused by me i had nothing to do with story the press is going out of their way to convince people that i do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite the media is so after me on women  wow this is a tough business nobody has more respect for women than donald trump top suspect in paris massacre salah abdeslam who also knew of the brussels attack is no longer talking weak leaders ridiculous laws wow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me how am i still number one by a lot i didn't start the fight with lyin'ted cruz over the gq cover pic of melania he did he knew the pac was putting it out hence lyin' ted just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the trump u case but the press refuses to write about it if i lost-monster story make america great again  endorsements for lyin' ted cruz-  europe and the us must immediately stop taking in people from syria this will be the destruction of civilization as we know it so sad just announced that as many as 5000 isis fighters have infiltrated europe also many in us  i told you so i alone can fix this problem explain how the women on the view which is a total disaster since the great barbara walters left ever got their jobs  is wasting time  tv show which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on i tell them no hillary clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years time for a change i will solve and fast it is amazing how often i am right only to be criticized by the media illegal immigration take the oil build the wall muslims nato remember when i recently said that brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing  wrote a critical article i was so right these politicians like cruz and graham who have watched isis and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better  and lyin' ted cruz are two politicians who are very much alike all talk and no action both talk about isis do nothing it is amazing how  gets on so many tv shows talking negatively about me when i beat him so badly zero in his pres run we pay a disproportionate share of the cost of nato why it is time to renegotiate and the time is now nato is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on make america great again i want to thank  for all of his help in our historic arizona win could not have done it without you joe while i believe i will clinch before cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race i think having jeb's endorsement hurts lyin' ted jeb spent more than $150000000 and got nothing i spent a fraction of that and am first i will be the best by far in fighting terror i'm the only one that was right from the beginning  now lyin' ted  others are copying me just watched hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror she's been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are low energy jeb bush just endorsed a man he truly hates lyin' ted cruz honestly i can't blame jeb in that i drove him into oblivion lyin' ted cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from michael douglas just another dishonest politician thank you arizona    lyin' ted cruz denied that he had anything to do with the gq model photo post of melania that's why we call him lyin' ted hopefully the republican party can come together and have a big win in november paving the way for many great supreme court justices much bigger win than anticipated in arizona thank you i will never forget thank you arizona    incompetent hillary despite the horrible attack in brussels today wants borders to be weak and open-and let the muslims flow in  no way lyin' ted cruz just used a picture of melania from a gq shoot in his ad be careful lyin' ted or i will spill the beans on your wife pres obama should leave the baseball game in cuba immediately  get home to washington- where a  under a serious emergency belongs obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger shame  message from     message from      video       my heart  prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible  tragedy this madness must be stopped and i will stop it watch this clip from earlier this year time  time again i have been right about terrorism it's time to get tough  i have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it's not even close hopefully az and ut will be voting for me today make america great again president obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in cuba especially in the shadows of brussels he is being treated badly do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place brussels was not anymore it is from a different world us must be vigilant and smart wow president obama just landed in cuba a big deal and raul castro wasn't even there to greet him he greeted pope and others no respect big republican dinner tonight at mar-a-lago in palm beach i will be there so the highly overrated anchor  is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but i can't fight back

take on paul ryan just leaving salt lake city utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions love utah- will be back why haven't they released the final missouri victory for us yet could it be because

ohio two more days and ohio was mine see you in arizona on friday and saturday  please explain to the dummies at the   editorial board that i love to debate and have won according to drudge etc all 11

had only 3 opponents-i had 16apologize the reason lyin' ted cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem crazy  is now complaining that   did not defend her against me yet her bad show is a total hit piece on metough great news that  has cancelled the additional debate how many times can the same people ask the same question i beat cruz debating crazy  supposedly had lyin' ted cruz on her show last night ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse ted can't win stuart stevens the failed campaign manager of
