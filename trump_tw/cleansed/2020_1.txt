LAW  ORDER
Our National Guard stopped them cold last night Should have been called up sooner 
SO TERRIBLE Where are the arrests and LONG TERM jail sentences 
STRENGTH 
Get tough Democrat Mayors and Governors These people are ANARCHISTS Call in our National Guard NOW The World is watching and laughing at you and Sleepy Joe Is this what America wants NO
Law  Order in Philadelphia NOW They are looting stores Call in our great National Guard like they FINALLY did (thank you President Trump) last night in Minneapolis Is this what voters want with Sleepy Joe All Dems
The Lamestream Media is doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy As long as everybody understands what they are doing that they are FAKE NEWS and truly bad people with a sick agenda we can easily work through them to GREATNESS
The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization
Other Democrat run Cities and States should look at the total shutdown of Radical Left Anarchists in Minneapolis last night The National Guard did a great job and should be used in other States before it is too late
Congratulations to our National Guard for the great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis Minnesota last night The ANTIFA led anarchists among others were shut down quickly Should have been done by Mayor on first night and there would have been no trouble
Let New York’s Finest be New York’s Finest There is nobody better but they must be allowed to do their job
The National Guard has been released in Minneapolis to do the job that the Democrat Mayor couldn’t do Should have been used 2 days ago  there would not have been damage  Police Headquarters would not have been taken over  ruined Great job by the National Guard No games
MN Gov Walz We Estimate 80percent of the Rioters Are from out of State  via 
Hopefully a great successful and safe ROCKET LAUNCH Lifting off soon    
80percent of the RIOTERS in Minneapolis last night were from OUT OF STATE They are harming businesses (especially African American small businesses) homes and the community of good hardworking Minneapolis residents who want peace equality and to provide for their families
Much more disinformation coming out of CNN MSDNC  and  by far than coming out of any foreign country even combined Fake News is the Enemy of the People
Crossing State lines to incite violence is a FEDERAL CRIME Liberal Governors and Mayors must get MUCH tougher or the Federal Government will step in and do what has to be done and that includes using the unlimited power of our Military and many arrests Thank you
Here we go again Fake News  is blaming RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA They are sick losers with VERY bad ratings PS Can’t blame China because they need the cash
It’s ANTIFA and the Radical Left Don’t lay the blame on others
Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis will never be mistaken for the late great General Douglas McArthur or great fighter General George Patton How come all of these places that defend so poorly are run by Liberal Democrats Get tough and fight (and arrest the bad ones) STRENGTH
These are Organized Groups that have nothing to do with George Floyd Sad
The professionally managed so-called protesters at the White House had little to do with the memory of George Floyd They were just there to cause trouble The  handled them easily Tonight I understand is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE
They professionally managed so-called protesters at the White House had little to do with the memory of George Floyd They were just there to cause trouble The  handled them easily Tonight I understand is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE
They professionally managed so-called protesters at the White House had little to do with the memory of George Floyd They were just their to cause trouble The  handled them easily Tonight I understand is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE
good practice As you saw last night they were very cool  very professional Never let it get out of hand Thank you On the bad side the DC Mayor  who is always looking for money  help wouldn’t let the DC Police get involved Not their job Nice
have been greeted with the most vicious dogs and most ominous weapons I have ever seen That’s when people would have been really badly hurt at least Many Secret Service agents just waiting for action We put the young ones on the front line sir they love it and
Great job last night at the White House by the US  They were not only totally professional but very cool I was inside watched every move and couldn’t have felt more safe They let the protesters scream  rant as much as they wanted but whenever someone
got too frisky or out of line they would quickly come down on them hard didn’t know what hit them The front line was replaced with fresh agents like magic Big crowd professionally organized but nobody came close to breaching the fence If they had they would
Time for a change  
It was spoken as a fact not as a statement It’s very simple nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters and those looking to cause trouble on social media Honor the memory of George Floyd
Looting leads to shooting and that’s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot I don’t want this to happen and that’s what the expression put out last night means
REVOKE 230
The National Guard has arrived on the scene They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared George Floyd will not have died in vain Respect his memory
The National Guard has been activated In Minneapolis They have arrived on the seen George Floyd will not have died in vain Respect his memory
CHINA
Regulate Twitter if they are going to start regulating free speech    Well as they have just proven conclusively that’s what they are doing Repeal Section 230
The President has been targeted by Twitter   What about all of the lies and fraudulent statements made by Adam Schiff and so many others on the Russian Witch Hunt Plus Plus Plus What about China’s propaganda WHO’s mistakes No flags  
Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies  propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party They have targeted Republicans Conservatives  the President of the United States Section 230 should be revoked by Congress Until then it will be regulated
These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd and I won’t let that happen Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way Any difficulty and we will assume control but when the looting starts the shooting starts Thank you
I can’t stand back  watch this happen to a great American City Minneapolis A total lack of leadership Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor Jacob Frey get his act together and bring the City under control or I will send in the National Guard  get the job done right

The men and women of the National Guard have been doing a great job fighting the CoronaVirus This week I will extend their Title 32 orders through mid-August so they can continue to help States succeed in their response and recovery efforts

Thank you to  and  for their hard work and leadership Look forward to being back with you on Saturday
WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE OF AMERICANS IS WRONG
Twitter has now shown that everything we have been saying about them (and their other compatriots) is correct Big action to follow
The Radical Left Lamestream Media together with their partner the Do Nothing Democrats are trying to spread a new narrative that President Trump was slow in reacting to Covid 19 Wrong I was very fast even doing the Ban on China long before anybody thought necessary
Psycho Joe Scarborough is rattled not only by his bad ratings but all of the things and facts that are coming out on the internet about opening a Cold Case He knows what is happening
We pass 15000000 Tests Today by far the most in the World Open Safely
We are acting as a police force not the fighting force that we are in Afghanistan After 19 years it is time for them to police their own Country Bring our soldiers back home but closely watch what is going on and strike with a thunder like never before if necessary
OBAMAGATE MAKES WATERGATE LOOK LIKE SMALL POTATOES
New papers make CLEAR that the Obama Administration SPIED in an unprecedented manner on the Trump Campaign and beyond and even on the United States Senate Nobody would ever have believed that this level of illegality and corruption would be taking place in our beautiful USA
We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute Thank you
happen again Just like we can’t let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country It would be a free for all on cheating forgery and the theft of Ballots Whoever cheated the most would win Likewise Social Media Clean up your act NOW
Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices We will strongly regulate or close them down before we can ever allow this to happen We saw what they attempted to do and failed in 2016 We can’t let a more sophisticated version of that
Former CBS Reporter One Of The First ‘To Identify Myself As A Target of Illegal Spying Under Obama Admin’ 
Congratulations to author Nick Adams on the  publication of your new book Trump and Churchill Defenders of Western Civilization Certainly a great honor to be compared in any way to Winston Churchill  
The Failing  winner of  for its totally flawed coverage of the illegal Russia Witch Hunt does its research as follows Think of the absolute worst things you can say about Donald J Trump pretend there are sources and just say it RETURN THE PULITZERS
Great News The boring but very nasty magazine The Atlantic is rapidly failing going down the tubes and has just been forced to announce it is laying off at least 20percent of its staff in order to limp into the future This is a tough time to be in the Fake News Business
Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH and I as President will not allow it to happen
 is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots which will lead to massive corruption and fraud is incorrect based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post
I hope all Republican House Members vote NO on FISA until such time as our Country is able to determine how and why the greatest political criminal and subversive scandal in USA history took place
A total double standard The only thing the Dems have going for them is their very close relationship with the Fake News Lamestream Media
Didn’t Obama whose Administration has now been caught cold illegally spying on the Trump campaign recently also get caught playing golf on a course in Virginia despite his wife Michelle urging people to stay home before and after his round in a major public service message
How brilliant are our FARMERS Thank you  real talent  
One person lost to this invisible virus is too much it should have been stopped at its source China but I acted very quickly and made the right decisions Many of the current political complainers thought at the time that I was moving far to fast like Crazy Nancy
For all of the political hacks out there if I hadn’t done my job well  early we would have lost 1 1/2 to 2 Million People as opposed to the 100000 plus that looks like will be the number That’s 15 to 20 times more than we will lose I shut down entry from China very early
We made most Governors look very good even great by getting them the Ventilators unlimited Testing and supplies all of which they should have had in their own stockpiles So they look great and I just keep rolling along doing great things and getting Fake Lamestream News
Stock Market up BIG DOW crosses 25000 SP 500 over 3000 States should open up ASAP The Transition to Greatness has started ahead of schedule There will be ups and downs but next year will be one of the best ever
about whether or not Joe could have done such a horrible thing Maybe or maybe not but I find Joe to be a total Nut Job and I knew him well far better than most So many unanswered  obvious questions but I won’t bring them up now Law enforcement eventually will
The opening of a Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough was not a Donald Trump original thought this has been going on for years long before I joined the chorus In 2016 when Joe  his wacky future ex-wife Mika would endlessly interview me I would always be thinking
The opening of a Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough
Sean Parnell is an American Hero Conor Lamb has proven to be an American fraud and a puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi He said he would NOT vote for her for Speaker and did Will kill 2A Voted to impeach (on nothing) A TOTAL  COMPLETE Sean Parnell Endorsement 
living in the state no matter who they are or how they got there will get one That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people many of whom have never even thought of voting before how and for whom to vote This will be a Rigged Election No way
There is NO WAY (ZERO) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent Mail boxes will be robbed ballots will be forged  even illegally printed out  fraudulently signed The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people anyone
Joe Biden’s handling of the H1N1 Swine Flu was a complete and total disaster Even polls on the matter were terrible
Great reviews on our handling of Covid 19 sometimes referred to as the China Virus Ventilators Testing Medical Supply Distribution we made a lot of Governors look very good And got no credit for so doing Most importantly we helped a lot of great people
Nobody in 50 years has been WEAKER on China than Sleepy Joe Biden He was asleep at the wheel He gave them EVERYTHING they wanted including rip-off Trade Deals I am getting it all back
Sleepy Joe Biden (mostly his reps) went crazy when I banned in late January people coming in from China He called me xenophobic  then went equally nuts when we let in 44000 people until he was told they were American citizens coming home He later apologized
Sean Parnell is an American Hero Connor Lamm has proven to be an American fraud and a puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi He said he would NOT vote for her for Speaker and did Will kill 2A Voted to impeach (on nothing)  A TOTAL  COMPLETE Sean Parnell Endorsement 
I have zero interest in moving the Republican National Convention to Doral in Miami as falsely reported by the Fake News  in order to stir up trouble Ballroom is not nearly big enough  would like to stay in NC whose gov doesn’t even know if he can let people in 
Hawaii in a big fully loaded 747 to play What did that do to the so-called Carbon Footprint He also played moments after the brutal killing by ISIS of a wonderful young man Totally inappropriate and it was me who shattered 100percent of the ISIS Caliphate I was left a MESS
3 months and if I waited 3 years they would do their usual hit pieces anyway They are sick with hatred and dishonesty They are truly deranged They don’t mention Sleepy Joe’s poor work ethic  or all of the time Obama spent on the golf course often flying to
Some stories about the fact that in order to get outside and perhaps even a little exercise I played golf over the weekend The Fake  Totally Corrupt News makes it sound like a mortal sin I knew this would happen What they don’t say is that it was my first golf in almost
TRANSITION TO GREATNESS Get ready it is already happening again
HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY
to find with all of the jobs and economic development it brings another Republican National Convention site This is not something I want to do Thank you and I LOVE the people of North Carolina
made by many thousands of enthusiastic Republicans and others to head to beautiful North Carolina in August They must be immediately given an answer by the Governor as to whether or not the space will be allowed to be fully occupied If not we will be reluctantly forced
full attendance in the Arena In other words we would be spending  millions of dollars building the Arena to a very high standard without even knowing if the Democrat Governor would allow the Republican Party to fully occupy the space Plans are being
I love the Great State of North Carolina so much so that I insisted on having the Republican National Convention in Charlotte at the end of August Unfortunately Democrat Governor  is still in Shutdown mood  unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

I give and have given from the beginning my entire yearly salary $400000 to $450000 back to our government Last check to HHS Covid relief My great honor 
vacationing relaxing  making shady deals with other countries  that Barack was always playing golf doing much of his traveling in a fume spewing 747 to play golf in Hawaii Once even teeing off immediately after announcing the gruesome death of a great young man by ISIS
Sleepy Joe’s representatives have just put out an ad saying that I went to play golf (exercise) today They think I should stay in the White House at all times What they didn’t say is that it’s the first time I’ve played golf in almost 3 months that Biden was constantly
The Democrats are trying to Rig the 2020 Election plain and simple 
A disgrace Total corruption 
Thank you We love our boaters 
Be sure to watch Witch Hunt the Flynn Vindication hosted by the very knowledgeable  on  tonight at 8:00 PM This is yet another part of the greatest Criminal Hoax in American History

Cases numbers and deaths are going down all over the Country
A lot of interest in this story about Psycho Joe Scarborough So a young marathon runner just happened to faint in his office hit her head on his desk  die I would think there is a lot more to this story than that An affair What about the so-called investigator Read story

We’ve done a GREAT job on Covid response making all Governors look good some fantastic (and that’s OK) but the Lamestream Media doesn’t want to go with that narrative and the Do Nothing Dems talking point is to say only bad about Trump I made everybody look good but me
95percent Approval Rating in Republican Party 51percent Plus overall But you NEVER read or see this in the Fake News Media Always hearing bad made up numbers on how badly I’m doing Lamestream Media is unhinged and CORRUPT 
Mexico must take control of this very big problem

As I have said for a long time dealing with China is a very expensive thing to do We just made a great Trade Deal the ink was barely dry and the World was hit by the Plague from China 100 Trade Deals wouldn’t make up the difference and all those innocent lives lost
When the so-called rich guys speak negatively about the market you must always remember that some are betting big against it and make a lot of money if it goes down Then they go positive get big publicity and make it going up They get you both ways Barely legal
Obama was always wrong 
Does anybody believe this man Caught

For the constant criticism from the Do Nothing Democrats and their Fake News partners here is the newest chart on our great testing miracle compared to other countries Dems and LameStream Media should be proud of the USA instead of always ripping us down 
Governors should let roads and highway construction begin before heavy traffic starts which will be soon Some Governors never stopped which proved to be very smart They built and fixed roads during long no traffic periods Also saved big dollars

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January just prior to my banning China from the US Also they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening or matter of fact manner
Fake News got it wrong again as always and tens of thousands of lives were saved by my EARLY BAN of China into our Country The people that we’re allowed were heavily scrutinized and tested US citizens and as such I welcome them with open arms
Thank you very much to our beautiful boaters I will never let you down

Cryin Chuck Schumer compared to what other Senators have brought home to their states has brought very little back to NY A totally overrated loser the one thing he has given them is SALT He never even called me to stop it No wonder Cuomo  most others can’t stand him AOC
Cryin’ Chuck Schumer was on a late night show using a false talking point over  over again We don’t have enough testing  he would repeat when he knows we have done a great job on Testing just like we have on Ventilators and everything else He lied gave NY SALT Run AOC

Plus many 
Really Have you looked at the numbers lately 
FAKE POLLING just like 2016 (but worse)
What happened to General Michael Flynn a war hero should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the United States again
Does anybody really believe that Roger Stone a man whose house was raided early in the morning by 29 gun toting FBI Agents (with Fake News  closely in toe) was treated fairly How about the jury forewoman with her unannounced hatred  bias Same scammers as General Flynn
Despite reports to the contrary Sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown As of today 2462 people have died there a much higher number than the neighboring countries of Norway (207) Finland (206) or Denmark (443) The United States made the correct decision
Lyin’ Brian Williams of MSDNC 
I must admit that Lyin’ Brian Williams is while dumber than hell quite a bit smarter than Fake News  anchorman Don Lemon the dumbest man on television Then you have Psycho Joe What Ever Happened To Your Girlfriend Scarborough another of the low IQ individuals
Lyin’ Brian Williams of MSDNC a Concast Scam Company wouldn’t know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead Remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter Totally made up story He’s a true dummy who was thrown off Network News like a dog Stay tuned
Just told that Fake News  is falsely reporting that I was recently shouting at my campaign manager over made up nonsense Actually he is doing a great job I never shouted at him (been with me for years including the 2016 win)  have no intention to do so Just FAKE NEWS
 doesn’t want to speak about their persecution of General Michael Flynn  why they got the story so wrong They along with others should pay a big price for what they have purposely done to this man  his family They won’t even cover the big breaking news about this scam
Happy Birthday to three time Olympian and five term Congressman

THANK YOU  

At least they admit it The Failing    never correct their Fake Reporting 
The only reason the US has reported one million cases of CoronaVirus is that our Testing is sooo much better than any other country in the World Other countries are way behind us in Testing and therefore show far fewer cases

We are doing far more and better Testing than any other country in the world and yet the media does nothing but complain No matter how good a job is done the same as with the Ventilators they will never say we are doing a great job they will only viciously gripe
Because Shifty is a crooked politician 
I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:30 PM Thank you
Why should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois as example) and cities in all cases Democrat run and managed when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help I am open to discussing anything but just asking
FAKE NEWS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE
There has never been in the history of our Country a more vicious or hostile Lamestream Media than there is right now even in the midst of a National Emergency the Invisible Enemy
Blame the Democrats for any lateness in your Enhanced Unemployment Insurance I wanted the money to be paid directly they insisted it be paid by states for distribution I told them this would happen especially with many states which have old computers
So true 
American citizens We were long ahead of Dems who were all against the BAN 
Great 
They are one of the worst in the news business Total slime balls 
They asked me to be at West Point on June 13th  I will be there 
Laura just another Fake News Report 
Does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called Noble (not Nobel) Prize is especially as it pertains to Reporters and Journalists Noble is defined as having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals Does sarcasm ever work
Reports that HHS Secretary  is going to be fired by me are Fake News The Lamestream Media knows this but they are desperate to create the perception of chaos  havoc in the minds of the public They never even called to ask Alex is doing an excellent job
fraud  (and others who are even worse) Chris Wallace is nastier to Republicans than even Deface the Nation or Sleepy Eyes The people who are watching  in record numbers (thank you President Trump) are angry They want an alternative now So do I
Even the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats laughed at the Fox suggestion No respect for the people running  But Fox keeps on plugging to try and become politically correct They put RINO Paul Ryan on their Board They hire debate questions to Crooked Hillary
 just doesn’t get what’s happening They are being fed Democrat talking points and they play them without hesitation or research They forgot that Fake News   MSDNC wouldn’t let  participate even a little bit in the poor ratings Democrat Debates
Lawsuits should be brought against all including the Fake News Organizations to rectify this terrible injustice For all of the great lawyers out there do we have any takers When will the Noble Committee Act Better be fast
to the REAL REPORTERS  JOURNALISTS who got it right I can give the Committee a very comprehensive list When will the Noble Committee DEMAND the Prizes back especially since they were gotten under fraud The reporters and Lamestream Media knew the truth all along
When will all of the reporters who have received Noble Prizes for their work on Russia Russia Russia only to have been proven totally wrong (and in fact it was the other side who committed the crimes) be turning back their cherished Nobles so that they can be given
schedule and eating habits written by a third rate reporter who knows nothing about me I will often be in the Oval Office late into the night  read  see that I am angrily eating a hamburger  Diet Coke in my bedroom People with me are always stunned Anything to demean
I work from early in the morning until late at night haven’t left the White House in many months (except to launch Hospital Ship Comfort) in order to take care of Trade Deals Military Rebuilding etc and then I read a phony story in the failing  about my work
The people that know me and know the history of our Country say that I am  the hardest working President in history I don’t know about that but I am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any President in history The Fake News hates it

I never said the pandemic was a Hoax Who would say such a thing I said that the Do Nothing Democrats together with their Mainstream Media partners are the Hoax They have been called out  embarrassed on this even admitting they were wrong but continue to spread the lie

We have now Tested more than 5 Million People That is more than any other country in the World and even more than  all major countries combined
It is a wonderful feeling to know that our States are loaded up with Ventilators many brand new and high quality just off of our production lines and that we are now in a position to help other countries that so desperately need them Every person needing a Ventilator got one
Just spoke to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali of Ethiopia His Country needs Ventilators and the US is in good position to help him We will

It is amazing that I became President of the United States with such a totally corrupt and dishonest Lamestream Media going after me all day and all night Either I’m really good far better than the Fake News wants to admit or they don’t have nearly the power as once thought

Last month all you heard from the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats was Ventilators Ventilators Ventilators They screamed it loud  clear  thought they had us cold even though it was the State’s task But everyone got their V’s with many to spare Now they scream

Great book by  
 Dems say President Trump is trying to open the United States Economy too quickly but if I took even a little more time they would loudly chant that I am moving too slowly Just political talking points for them For me it’s about lives   the future of our Country
Nervous Nancy is an inherently dumb person She wasted all of her time on the Impeachment Hoax She will be overthrown either by inside or out just like her last time as Speaker Wallace   are on a bad path watch 
Just like I was right on Ventilators (our Country is now the King of Ventilators other countries are calling asking for help-we will) I am right on testing Governors must be able to step up and get the job done We will be with you ALL THE WAY
Great credit must be given to  and all of those that are helping our States make it big

I gave up on Drudge (a really nice guy) long ago as have many others People are dropping off like flies 
The most often used phrase in the Lamestream Media by far is sources say or officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity or anything similar which allows Fake News to make up a phony quote from a person who doesn’t even exist The American people should demand NAMES
them happy or even a little bit satisfied They were RUDE and NASTY This is their political playbook and they will use it right up to the election on November 3rd They will not change because they feel that this is the only way they can win America will not be fooled
Example VP Mike Pence held a conference call yesterday with all Democrat Senators He gave them everything that they would have wanted to hear in terms of gaining ground on the CoronaVirus but nothing that anyone could have said including it’s over could have made
No matter what you do for the Do Nothing Democrats no matter how GREAT a job you are doing they will only respond to their Fake partners in the Lamestream Media in the negative even in a time of crisis I thought it would be different but it’s not In fact it’s even worse
Great news thank you

White House news conference today at 6:00 PM Eastern Thank you
Cuomo ridiculously wanted 40 thousand Ventilators We gave him a small fraction of that number and it was plenty State should have had them in stockpile
The States have to step up their TESTING
China has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy It is far higher than that and far higher than the US not even close
Biden/Obama were a disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers 17000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence Also don’t forget their 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare website that should have cost close to nothing
testing that you should be doing We have given New York far more money help and equipment than any other state by far  these great men  women who did the job never hear you say thanks Your numbers are not good Less talk and more action
Governor Cuomo should spend more time doing and less time complaining Get out there and get the job done Stop talking We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn’t need or use gave large numbers of Ventilators that you should have had and helped you with
LIBERATE VIRGINIA and save your great 2nd Amendment It is under siege

White House news conference today at 5:00 PM Eastern Thank you
It is the decision of the President and for many good reasons With that being said the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors and this will continue A decision by me in conjunction with the Governors and input from others will be made shortly
For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states not that of the President of the United States  the Federal Government Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect

The Opposition Party (Lamestream Media) and their partner the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats have put their political game plan in full swing Whether he is right or wrong it doesn’t matter Criticize ’Trump’ for everything and don’t let the public see Biden Hide him
If the Fake News Opposition Party is pushing with all their might the fact that President Trump ignored early warnings about the threat then why did Media  Dems viciously criticize me when I instituted a Travel Ban on China They said early  not necessary Corrupt Media

The CBS News poll said 13 percent of Republicans trusted the news media for information about the virus Michael M Grynbaum 
alone attracted 62 million viewers for the president’s briefing  an astounding number for a 6 pm cable broadcast more akin to the viewership for a popular prime-time sitcom
On Monday nearly 122 million people watched Mr Trump’s briefing on CNN Fox News and MSNBC according to Nielsen  ‘Monday Night Football’ numbers Millions more are watching on ABC CBS NBC and online streaming sites and the audience is expanding On Monday Fox News
President Trump is a ratings hit Since reviving the daily White House briefing Mr Trump and his coronavirus updates have attracted an average audience of 85 million on cable news roughly the viewership of the season finale of ‘The Bachelor’ Numbers are continuing to rise
Because the Ratings of my News Conferences etc are so high Bachelor finale Monday Night Football type numbers according to the  the Lamestream Media is going CRAZY Trump is reaching too many people we must stop him said one lunatic See you at 5:00 PM

very often FAKE NEWS Lamestream Media should be forced to reveal sources very much as they did in the long ago past If they did that the media would be trusted again and Fake News would largely be a thing of the past
very often FAKE NEWS Lamestream Media should be forced to reveal sources very much as they did in the long ago past If they did that the media would be trusted again and Fake News would largely be a thing if the past
One of the reasons that Fake News has become so prevalent  far reaching is the fact that corrupt journalists base their stories on SOURCES that they make up in order to totally distort a narrative or story When you see five sources say don’t believe the story it is
So much of the Lamestream Media is writing and broadcasting stories with facts that are made up and knowingly wrong They are doing it by quoting unnamed sources that simply do not exist These are very dangerous  corrupt people who will do anything to win NAME YOUR SOURCES
Thank you James 
More Fake News

us since the beginning of this crisis They meant the opposite Forgot to mention that I closed our Country to China (and Europe) very early long before it was considered acceptable to do so Sleepy Joe said I was xenophobic but I saved thousands of lives Fake News
This is the way the  finished a story on me You can see the contrast between the steady assured informed and strong leadership that VP Biden (Sleepy Joe) has shown and the bungling chaotic and dishonest start-stop approach that Mr (not Pres) Trump has shown
is NOT their fault in any way shape or form They are working closely with us to get rid of it WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER

the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES I will always put
I fully support HR 6201 Families First CoronaVirus Response Act which will be voted on in the House this evening This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers I have directed
Americans are the strongest and most resilient people on earthWe will remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they are entitled to No resource will be spared 
No matter where you may be I encourage you to turn towards prayer in an act of faith Together we will easily PREVAIL
It is my great honor to declare Sunday March 15th as a National Day of Prayer We are a Country that throughout our history has looked to God for protection and strength in times like these
At my request effective midnight tonight Carnival Royal Caribbean Norwegian and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days It is a great and important industry  it will be kept that way
We will remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care they need No resource will be spared 
To unleash the full power of the Federal Government in this effort today I am officially declaring a National Emergency 
I will be having a news conference today at 3:00 PM The White House Topic CoronaVirus
To this point and because we have had a very strong border policy we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus If we had weak or open borders that number would be many times higher
The Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks Jay Powell and group are putting us at a decided economic  physiological disadvantage Should never have been this way Also STIMULATE
If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly  efficiently let them have the full money that they earned APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year December 31 Then you are doing something that is really meaningful Only that will make a big difference
 Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster with thousands dying and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem until now The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis All Red Tape has been cut ready to go
For decades the  looked at and studied  its testing system but did nothing about it It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic but a pandemic would never happen they hoped President Obama made changes that only complicated things further
The Obama White House had to immediately issue an apology for Joe Biden’s remarks and any alarm that he might have caused an alarm about a Swine Flu outbreak that took 6 months for President Obama to declare a National Emergency and that killed 12000 Americans 
Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people The response was one of the worst on record Our response is one of the best with fast action of border closings  a 78percent Approval Rating the highest on record His was lowest
Just had a great conversation with Prime Minister Abe of Japan I told him that the just completed Olympic venue is magnificent He has done an incredible job one that will make him very proud Good things will happen for Japan and their great Prime Minister Lots of options
108 countries are dealing with the CoronaVirus problem some of which we are helping

Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what led to and happened with the illegal attempted coup of the duly elected President of the United States and others
Nancy Pelosi all of a sudden doesn’t like the payroll tax cut but when Obama proposed it she thought it was a brilliant thing that all of the working families would benefit from because if you get a paycheck you’re going to take home more money  
Hoping to get the payroll tax cut approved by both Republicans and Democrats and please remember very important for all countries  businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe The restriction stops people not goods
The Media should view this as a time of unity and strength We have a common enemy actually an enemy of the World the CoronaVirus We must beat it as quickly and safely as possible There is nothing more important to me than the life  safety of the United States
I will be addressing the Nation this evening at 9:00 PM (Eastern) from the Oval Office
I am fully prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government to deal with our current challenge of the CoronaVirus
We have the greatest healthcare system experts scientists and doctors anywhere in the world Together we will PREVAIL
I want to thank all of our Great Government officials on the CoronaVirus Task Force who are working around the clock in response to the CoronaVirus Continue to check  for updates and follow all recommendations that are available
Together we are putting into policy a plan to prevent detect treat and create a vaccine against CoronaVirus to save lives in America and the world America will get it done
America is the Greatest Country in the world We have the best scientists doctors nurses and health care professionals They are amazing people who do phenomenal things every day
Someone needs to tell the Democrats in Congress that CoronaVirus doesn’t care what party you are in We need to protect ALL Americans
Vanity Fair Magazine which will soon be out of business and their third rate Fake reporters who make up sources which don’t exist wrote yet another phony  boring hit piece The facts are just the opposite Our team is doing a great job with CoronaVirus
Thank you Gavin Team is doing a great job 
THANK YOU IDAHO  
Pocahontas working in conjunction with the Democrat Party totally destroyed the campaign of Bernie Sanders If she would have quit 3 days earlier Sanders would have beaten Biden in a route it wouldn’t even have been close They also got two other losers to support Sleepy Joe

Great meeting on Capitol Hill with the  
Thank you  
Ronald Reagan’s great economist the recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom has just said great things about a Payroll Tax Cut
Our CoronaVirus Team has been doing a great job Even Democrat governors have been VERY complimentary
Nancy Pelosi just said I don’t know if we can be ready this week In other words it’s off to vacation for the Do Nothing Democrats That’s been the story with them for 1 1/2 years
There is another Russia Russia Russia meeting today It is headed up by corrupt politician Adam Shifty Schiff so I wouldn’t expect too much 
The Federal Reserve must be a leader not a very late follower which it has been
Our pathetic slow moving Federal Reserve headed by Jay Powell who raised rates too fast and lowered too late should get our Fed Rate down to the levels of our competitor nations They now have as much as a two point advantage with even bigger currency help Also stimulate
Well deserved Jack A great honor 
True with number 1 being more important 
Going to be a BAD day for Crazy Bernie
Polls say they BOTH lose to Trump 
Wow  blew away the competition of Morning Joke (which did very poorly) on MSDNC (Another Comcast sleaze production) and  New Day in the Morning Television Ratings A total blowout but that’s what you get when you treat Trump fairly
Going up fast We need the Wall more than ever

Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil That and the Fake News is the reason for the market drop
Good for the consumer gasoline prices coming down
So much FAKE NEWS
The BEST decision made was the toughest of them all which saved many lives Our VERY early decision to stop travel to and from certain parts of the world
Great job being done by the  and the CoronaVirus Task Force Thank you
The Obama/Biden Administration is the most corrupt Administration in the history of our Country
Trump has outmastered the Deep State He’s light years ahead of us MSDNC I disagree We have a long way to go There are still some very bad sick people in our government people who do not love our Country (In fact they hate our Country)
Now the Democrats are trying to smear Bernie with Russia Russia Russia They are driving him Crazy
Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren singlehandedly destroyed the Bernie Sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on Super T He lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out 3 days earlier The DNC is doing it to Bernie again Will he ever get angry
Cryin’ Chuck Schumer said You will pay the price for this You won’t know what HIT YOU That is far beyond simple rhetoric That is a physical threat or at least a threat that you better vote for us Trouble ahead
The Fake News Media and their partner the Democrat Party is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation far beyond what the facts would warrant Surgeon General The risk is low to the average American
A great book support Charlie BUY IT  Already Number One 
Working hard Lori

Who knows what this means but it sounds good to me 
The New York Times is an embarrassment to journalism They were a dead paper before I went into politics and they will be a dead paper after I leave which will be in 5 years Fake News is the Enemy of the people
We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas which was a Godsend VP is doing a great job The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad Sad
Thank you 

least 5 States  the Nomination Did the DNC  Dems tell Elizabeth Warren to wait If so they were deadly the race would have been over  Bernie would have won Dirty double dealing Nobody knows for sure  history will be the judge But I say here we go AGAIN Bernie
We have now learned for sure that the Democrats don’t want anything to do with Crazy Bernie Rigged First    quit the race  come out for Sleepy Joe BEFORE Super Tuesday Pocahontas says NO  quits race AFTER ELECTION thereby depriving Bernie of at

Gallup just gave us the highest rating ever for the way we are handling the CoronaVirus situation The April 2009-10 Swine Flu where nearly 13000 people died in the US was poorly handled Ask MSDNC  lightweight Washington failure  who the President was then
The Department of Education is NOT closing hundreds of schools in rural areas of our Country This is just more Fake News We are investing greatly in our schools and always will
Mini Mike you’re easy  
With approximately 100000 CoronaVirus cases worldwide and 3280 deaths the United States because of quick action on closing our borders has as of now only 129 cases (40 Americans brought in) and 11 deaths We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible
Joe Biden represents the past President Trump represents the future   
Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren who was going nowhere except into Mini Mike’s head just dropped out of the Democrat PrimaryTHREE DAYS TOO LATE She cost Crazy Bernie at least Massachusetts Minnesota and Texas Probably cost him the nomination Came in third in Mass
 Kevin McCarthy informed me that I was 20 for 20 on Tuesday with respect to my Endorsement of candidates Sadly I didn’t get that information from the Fake News Media They don’t report those things or the far more than Dems cumulative votes despite no opposition
I want to commend the President for how he has handled the CoronaVirus situation especially his early decision to shut down access into our Country from China despite strong opposition to that decision  Thank you Tom
Schumer has brought great danger to the steps of the United States Supreme Court
I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work This is just more Fake News and disinformation put out by the Democrats in particular MSDNC Comcast covers the CoronaVirus situation horribly only looking to do harm to the incredible  successful effort being made
As per recent Federal Court ruling the Federal Government will be withholding funds from Sanctuary Cities They should change their status and go non-Sanctuary Do not protect criminals
I will be interviewed by  on  at 9:10 PM
Retired Four Star General Jack Keane will receive the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM next week
There can be few things worse in a civilized law abiding nation than a United States Senator openly and for all to see and hear threatening the Supreme Court or its Justices This is what Chuck Schumer just did He must pay a severe price for this
Retired Four Star General Jack Keane will recieve the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM next week
This is a direct  dangerous threat to the US Supreme Court by Schumer If a Republican did this he or she would be arrested or impeached Serious action MUST be taken NOW 
Thank you keep up the great work 
Congress has agreed to provide $8 Billion to fight Coronavirus This means   and  will have the resources they need to Keep America Safe and keep the risk to workers and families very low This is great news for our Health our Economy and our Nation

Pandering Mini Mike Bloomberg along with his wacky friend Tom Steyer have found out the hard way that you can’t buy the election They both wish they had it to do over again
Today it was my great honor to address the  Legislative Summit With the hard work love  devotion of millions of incredible Hispanic-Americans our Country is thriving our people are prospering and our future has never looked brighter 
Mini Mike Three months ago I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump (and I failed miserably)
Mini Mike Bloomberg will now FIRE Tim O’Brien and all of the fools and truly dumb people who got him into this MESS This has been the worst and most embarrassing experience of his lifeand now on to Sleepy Joe
Mini Mike Bloomberg just quit the race for President I could have told him long ago that he didn’t have what it takes and he would have saved himself a billion dollars the real cost Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe’s campaign hoping to save face It won’t work
The Mayor of Los Angeles  is dealing with us trying to get the Federal Government to fix the terrible problem he and the Dems have caused with the homeless and the horrendous effects it is having on the City which is a mess I then watch him talk trash on me
Wow If Elizabeth Warren wasn’t in the race Bernie Sanders would have EASILY won Massachusetts Minnesota and Texas not to mention various other states Our modern day Pocahontas won’t go down in history as a winner but she may very well go down as the all time great SPOILER

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then KEEP AMERICA GREAT
This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States  then doesn’t have the wisdom or courage to stare down  end the phony Russia Witch Hunt Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office and the Mueller Scam begins 
So selfish for Elizabeth Warren to stay in the race She has Zero chance of even coming close to winning but hurts Bernie badly So much for their wonderful liberal friendship Will he ever speak to her again She cost him Massachusetts (and came in third) he shouldn’t
The Democrat establishment came together and crushed Bernie Sanders AGAIN Even the fact that Elizabeth Warren stayed in the race was devastating to Bernie and allowed Sleepy Joe to unthinkably win Massachusetts It was a perfect storm with many good states remaining for Joe
THANK YOU CALIFORNIA  
THANK YOU UTAH  
But they really knew who was going to win 
Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren other than Mini Mike was the loser of the night She didn’t even come close to winning her home state of Massachusetts Well now she can just sit back with her husband and have a nice cold beer
The biggest loser tonight by far is Mini Mike Bloomberg His political consultants took him for a ride $700 million washed down the drain and he got nothing for it but the nickname Mini Mike and the complete destruction of his reputation Way to go Mike

The Black community brilliantly turned their backs on Mini Mike because they know he is a pandering phony who never did right by them 
Mini Mike Bloomberg didn’t bring NYC back as he said in his fake ad It was  who brought NYC back and who also with his endorsement got Mini Mike elected (with barely a thank you) A boring mayor who the people couldn’t stand
Pete Buttigieg is OUT All of his SuperTuesday votes will go to Sleepy Joe Biden Great timing This is the REAL beginning of the Dems taking Bernie out of play NO NOMINATION AGAIN

a very dark and lonely path Your reputation will never be the same
Mini Mike Bloomberg’s consultants and so-called advisors(how did that advice work out Don’t ask) are on the gravy train and all making a fortune for themselves pushing Mini hard when they knew he never had what it takes Don’t pay them anymore Mike they led you down
I would find it hard to believe that failed presidential candidates Tom Steyer or Mini Mike Bloombeg would contribute to the Democrat Party even against me after the way they have been treated laughed at  mocked The real politicians ate them up and spit them out
Tom Steyer who other than Mini Mike Bloomberg spent more dollars for NOTHING than any candidate in history quit the race today proclaiming how thrilled he was to be a part of the the Democrat Clown Show Go away Tom and save whatever little money you have left
Congratulations to Sleepy Joe Biden
Democrats are working hard to destroy the name and reputation of Crazy Bernie Sanders and take the nomination away from him
Sleepy Joe Biden’s victory in the South Carolina Democrat Primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg’s Joke of a campaign After the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates  Mini Mike now has Biden split up his very few voters taking many away
