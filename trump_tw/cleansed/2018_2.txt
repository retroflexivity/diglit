bob mueller or jeff sessions so much fake reporting and fake news the only thing james comey ever got right was when he said that president trump was not under investigation ivanka trump  jared kushner had nothing to do with the so called pushing out of don mcgahnthe fake news media has it purposelyso wrong they love to portray chaos in the white house when they know that chaos doesn't

rise beyond your wildest expectations more good news is coming i just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest much of the media is truth doesn't matter to them they only have their hatred  agenda this includes fake books which come out about me all the time always anonymous sources and are pure fiction enemy of the people what's going on at  is happening to different degrees at other networks with  being the worst the good news is that andy lacky is about to be fired for incompetence and much worse when lester holt got caught fudging my tape on russia they were hurt badly the hatred and extreme bias of me by  has clouded their thinking and made them unable to function but actually as i have always said this has been going on for a long time little jeff z has done a terrible job his ratings suck  att should fire him to save credibility watch kanye west says trump wants to be the ‘greatest president' for black americans  via  charge of the fisa court he should direct the presiding judge rosemary collier to hold a hearing haul all of these people from the doj  fbi in there  if she finds there were crimes committed and there were there should be a criminal referral by her  ohr told the fbi it the fake dossier wasn't true it was a lie and the fbi was determined to use it anyway to damage trump and to perpetrate a fraud on the court to spy on the trump campaign this is a fraud on the court the chief justice of the us supreme court is in lanny davis admits being anonymous source in cnn report   oh well so much for cnn saying it wasn't lanny no wonder their ratings are so low it's fake news cnn is being torn apart from within based on their being caught in a major lie and refusing to admit the mistake sloppy  a man who lives in the past and thinks like a degenerate fool making up story after story is being laughed at all over the country fake news differences they will be resolved in time by president trump and china's great president xi jinping their relationship and bond remain very strong of money on joint us-south korea war games besides the president can instantly start the joint exercises again with south korea and japan if he so chooses if he does they will be far bigger than ever before as for the uschina trade disputes and other considerable aid including money fuel fertilizer and various other commodities this is not helpful nonetheless the president believes that his relationship with kim jong un is a very good and warm one and there is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts statement from the white housepresident donald j trump feels strongly that north korea is under tremendous pressure from china because of our major trade disputes with the chinese government at the same time we also know that

nice no imagination  big rally tonight in west virginia patrick morrisey is running a great race for us senate i have done so much for west virginia against all odds and having patrick a real fighter by my side would make things so much easier see you later clean coal i am sorry to have to reiterate that there are serious and unpleasant consequences to crossing the border into the united states illegally if there were no serious consequences our country would be overrun with people trying to get in and our system could not handle it fake news of which there is soooo much this time the very tired new yorker falsely reported that i was going to take the extraordinary step of denying intelligence briefings to president obama never discussed or thought of even james clapper has admonished john brennan for having gone totally off the rails maybe clapper is being nice to me so he doesn't lose his security clearance for lying to congress a blue wave means crime and open borders a red wave means safety and strength i am hearing so many great things about the republican party's california gubernatorial candidate john cox he is a very successful businessman who is tired of high taxes  crime he will make california great again   make you proud of your great state again total endorsement will be going to the great state of west virginia on tuesday night to campaign  do a rally speech for a hard working and spectacular person ag patrick morrisey who is running for the us senate patrick has great energy  stamina-i need his vote to maga total endorsement just watched former intelligence official phillip mudd become totally unglued and weird while debating wonderful  over brennan's security clearance dennard destroyed him but mudd is in no mental condition to have such a clearance should be revoked   is an extraordinary woman of great accomplishment  potential she is running as a very popular republican for the congressional seat of my friend darrell issa-with his complete support diane is strong on crime loves our military  vets-has my total endorsement it is outrageous that poisonous synthetic heroin fentanyl comes pouring into the us postal system from china we can and must end this now the senate should pass the stop act  and firmly stop this poison from killing our children and destroying our country no more delay bruce ohr is at the center of false allegations which led to a multi-million dollar investigation into what apparently didn't happen darrell issa house oversight we can take out the word apparently   will bruce ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited dossier ever be fired from the jeff sessions  justice department a total joke everybody wants to keep their security clearance it's worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect brennan it certainly isn't because of the good job he did he is a political hack i hope john brennan the worst cia director in our country's history brings a lawsuit it will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the mueller rigged witch hunt he won't sue where's the collusion they made up a phony crime called collusion and when there was no collusion they say there was obstruction of a phony crime that never existed if you fight back or say anything bad about the rigged witch hunt they scream obstruction looking for trouble they are enjoying ruining people's lives and refuse to look at the real corruption on the democrat side the lies the firings the deleted emails and soooo much more mueller's angry dems are looking to impact the election they are a national disgrace disgraced and discredited bob mueller and his whole group of angry democrat thugs spent over 30 hours with the white house councel only with my approval for purposes of transparency anybody needing that much time when they know there is no russian collusion is just someone study the late joseph mccarthy because we are now in period with mueller and his gang that make joseph mccarthy look like a baby rigged witch hunt some members of the media are very angry at the fake story in the new york times they actually called to complain and apologize a big step forward from the day i announced the times has been fake news and with their disgusting new board member it will only get worse the failing new york times wrote a story that made it seem like the white house councel had turned on the president when in fact it is just the opposite  the two fake reporters knew this this is why the fake news media has become the enemy of the people so bad for america no collusion and no obstruction except by crooked hillary and the democrats all of the resignations and corruption yet heavily conflicted bob mueller refuses to even look in that direction what about the brennan comey mccabe strzok lies to congress or crooked's emails and have demanded transparency so that this rigged and disgusting witch hunt can come to a close so many lives have been ruined over nothing mccarthyism at its worst yet mueller  his gang of dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side media is even worse the failing  wrote a fake piece today implying that because white house councel don mcgahn was giving hours of testimony to the special councel he must be a john dean type rat but i allowed him and all others to testify i didn't have to i have nothing to hide i allowed white house counsel don mcgahn and all other requested members of the white house staff to fully cooperate with the special counsel in addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents most transparent in history no collusion no obstruction witch hunt the united states has ended the ridiculous 230 million dollar yearly development payment to syria saudi arabia and other rich countries in the middle east will start making payments instead of the us i want to develop the us our military and countries that help us the economy is stronger and better than ever before importantly there remains tremendous potential it will only get better with time great job  rachel campos-duffy on  has anyone looked at the mistakes that john brennan made while serving as cia director he will go down as easily the worst in history  since getting out he has become nothing less than a loudmouth partisan political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country all of the fools that are so focused on looking only at russia should start also looking in another direction china but in the end if we are smart tough and well prepared we will get along with everyone too many voices are being destroyed some good  some bad and that cannot be allowed to happen who is making the choices because i can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made let everybody participate good  bad and we will all just have to figure it out censorship is a very dangerous thing  absolutely impossible to police if you are weeding out fake news there is nothing so fake as cnn  msnbc  yet i do not ask that their sick behavior be removed i get used to it and watch with a grain of salt or don't watch at all social media is totally discriminating against republican/conservative voices speaking loudly and clearly for the trump administration we won't let that happen they are closing down the opinions of many people on the right while at the same time doing nothing to others i allowed white house counsel don mcgahn and all other requested members of the white house staff to fully cooperate with the special councel in addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents most transparent in history no collusion no obstruction witch hunt financial gain is a federal gratuity statute violation bribery statute violation honest services violationall major crimesbecause the doj is run by blank jeff sessions  gregg jarrett  so when does mueller do what must be done probably never  bruce ohr of doj is in legal jeopardy it's astonishing that he's still employed bruce  nelly ohr's bank account is getting fatter  fatter because of the dossier that they are both peddling he doesn't disclose it under fed regs using your federal office for personal bruce ohr of doj is in legal jeopardy it's astonishingthat he's still employed bruce  nelly ohr's bank account is getting fatter  fatter because of the dossier that they are both peddling he doesn't disclose it under fed regs using your federal office for personal fox news has learned that bruce ohr wrote christopher steele following the firing of james comey saying that he was afraid the anti-trump russia probe will be exposed  charles payne     how much more does mueller have to see they have blinders on rigged i say andrew's was a bigger and more incompetent blunder he should easily win his race against a super liberal actress but his political career is over which is worse hightax andrew cuomo's statement we're not going to make america great again it was never that great or hillary clinton's deplorables statement when a politician admits that we're not going to make america great again there doesn't seem to be much reason to ever vote for him this could be a career threatening statement by andrew cuomo with many wanting him to resign-he will get higher ratings than his brother chris wow big pushback on governor andrew cuomo of new york for his really dumb statement about america's lack of greatness i have already made america great again just look at the markets jobs military- setting records and we will do even better andrew choked badly mistake the us has more than double the growth

celebrating the end of the war on november 11th maybe we will do something next year in dc when the cost comes way down now we can buy some more jet fighters the local politicians who run washington dc poorly know a windfall when they see it when asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade they wanted a number so ridiculously high that i cancelled it never let someone hold you up i will instead how does a politician cuomo known for pushing people and businesses out of his state not to mention having the highest taxes in the us survive making the statement we're not going to make america great again it was never that great which section of the sentence is worse in speaking with some of the world's top business leaders i asked what it is that would make business jobs even better in the us stop quarterly reporting  go to a six month system said one that would allow greater flexibility  save money i have asked the sec to study wow big pushback on governor andrew cuomo of new york for his really dumb statement about america's lack of greatness i have already made america great again just look at the markets jobs military- setting records and we will do even better andrew chocked badly mistake released in 2017 if his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office it constitutes an intelligence breach  richard burr r-nc senate intel cmte chair   director brennan's recent statements purport to know as fact that the trump campaign colluded with a foreign power if director brennan's statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the cia why didn't he include it in the intelligence community assessment an incredibly corrupt fbi  doj trying to steer the outcome of a presidential election brennan has gone off the deep end he's disgraced and discredited himself his conduct has been outrageous chris farrell judicial watch how can senator richard blumenthal who went around for twenty years as a connecticut politician bragging that he was a great marine war hero in vietnam then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a marine nor ever in vietnam pass judgement on anyone loser  speaking of john brennan how did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be cia director in the first place now that is a really good question then followed by richard blumenthal of connecticut is a fake war hero so true a total fake very concerned about comey's firing afraid they will be exposed said bruce ohr doj's emails  notes show bruce ohr's connection to phony  discredited trump dossier a creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act rigged witch hunt while steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets he also asked for help with a russian oligarch  catherine herridge of     in other words they were colluding with russia the fbi received documents from bruce ohr of the justice department  whose wife nelly worked for fusion gps disgraced and fired

justice department can you believe he is still there is accused of helping disgraced christopher steele find dirt on trump ohr's wife nelly was in on the act big time worked for fusion gps on fake dossier  another terrorist attack in londonthese animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength when you give a crazed crying lowlife a break and give her a job at the white house i guess it just didn't work out good work by general kelly for quickly firing that dog lou dobbs this cannot go forwardthis special councel with all of his conflicts with his 17 angry democrats without any evidence of collusion by the trump campaign and russia the dems are the ones who should be investigated thank you lou so true should be shut down the strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt it should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors thank you judicial watch i couldn't have said it better myself guy was corrupt and had anti-trump animus strzok and others at the fbi should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation instead mueller is pretending nothing went wrong he used strzok he used the clinton dnc dossierthe whole thing tom fitton of judicial watch the strzok firing is as much about the mueller operation as anything else there would be no mueller special councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of strzok  his colleagues at the top levels of the fbi we know this such wonderful and powerful things about me a true champion of civil rights until she got fired omarosa had zero credibility with the media they didn't want interviews when she worked in the white house now that she says bad about me they will talk to her fake news  called to say that there are no tapes of the apprentice where i used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by wacky and deranged omarosa i don't have that word in my vocabulary and never have she made it up look at her many recent quotes saying scott walker of wisconsin is a tremendous governor who has done incredible things for that great state he has my complete  total endorsement he brought the amazing foxconn to wisconsin with its 15000 jobs-and so much more vote for scott on tuesday in the republican primary trump's foreign policy is actually boosting america's standing  it was my great honor to sign our new defense bill into law and to pay tribute to the greatest soldiers in the history of the world the us army the national defense authorization act is the most significant investment in our military and our warfighters in modern history  pete stauber is running for congress in minnesota he will make for a great congressman pete is strong on crime and borders loves our military vets and second amendment vote for pete tomorrow he has my full and total endorsement great to be in fort drum new york with our heroes  just landed at fort drum new york looking forward to

will have many victories including majors ahead of him congrats to brooks and his great team on a job well done wacky omarosa already has a fully signed non-disclosure agreement just fired agent strzok formerly of the fbi was in charge of the crooked hillary clinton sham investigation it was a total fraud on the american public and should be properly redone agent peter strzok was just fired from the fbi finally the list of bad players in the fbi  doj gets longer  longer based on the fact that strzok was in charge of the witch hunt will it be dropped it is a total hoax no collusion no obstruction i just fight back the very unpopular governor of ohio and failed presidential candidate  hurt troy balderson's recent win by tamping down enthusiasm for an otherwise great candidate even kasich's lt governor lost gov race because of his unpopularity credit to troy on the big win while i know it's not presidential to take on a lowlife like omarosa and while i would rather not be doing so this is a modern day form of communication and i know the fake news media will be working overtime to make even wacky omarosa look legitimate as possible sorry really bad things nasty to people  would constantly miss meetings  work when gen kelly came on board he told me she was a loser  nothing but problems i told him to try working it out if possible because she only said great things about me until she got fired wacky omarosa who got fired 3 times on the apprentice now got fired for the last time she never made it never will she begged me for a job tears in her eyes i said ok people in the white house hated her she was vicious but not smart i would rarely see her but heard seems like the department of justice and fbi had a program to keep donald trump from becoming president     if this had happened to the other side everybody involved would be in jail this is a media coverup of the biggest story of our time many  owners plan to boycott the company if manufacturing moves overseas great most other companies are coming in our direction including harley competitors a really bad move us will soon have a level playing field or better  your paycheck is bigger your pension is stronger   unemployment numbers are better than they have been in 50 years  perhaps ever our country is booming like never before and it will get even better many companies moving back to the usa   bob mueller isn't your whole investigation premised on a fake dossier paid for by hillary created by a man who hates donald trump  used to con a fisa court judge bob i really think it's time for you

love our country do you believe nelly worked for fusion and her husband still works for the department of justice i have never seen anything so rigged in my life our ag is scared stiff and missing in action it is all starting to be revealed not pretty ig report soon  witch hunt the big story that the fake news media refuses to report is lowlife christopher steele's many meetings with deputy ag bruce ohr and his beautiful wife nelly it was fusion gps that hired steele to write the phony  discredited dossier paid for by crooked hillary  the dnc i am proud to have fought for and secured the lowest african american and hispanic unemployment rates in history now i'm pushing for prison reform to give people who have paid their debt to society a second chance i will never stop fighting for

americans will the fbi ever recover it's once stellar reputation so badly damaged by comey mccabe peter s and his lover the lovely lisa page and other top officials now dismissed or fired so many of the great men and women of the fbi have been hurt by these clowns and losers why isn't the fbi giving andrew mccabe text messages  to judicial watch or appropriate governmental authorities fbi said they won't give up even one i may have to get involved do not destroy what are they hiding mccabe wife took big campaign dollars from hillary people will the fbi ever recover it's once stellar reputation so badly damaged by comey mccabe peter s and his lover the lovely lisa page and other top officials now dismissed or fired so many of the great men and women of the fbi have been hurt by these clowns and losers why isn't the fbi giving andrew mccabe text massages to judicial watch or appropriate governmental authorities fbi said they won't give up even one i may have to get involved do not destroy what are they hiding mccabe wife took big campaign dollars from hillary people deal with mexico is coming along nicely autoworkers and farmers must be taken care of or there will be no

forward to dinner tonight with tim cook of apple he is investing big dollars in usa democrats please do not distance yourselves from nancy pelosi she is a wonderful person whose ideas  policies may be bad but who should definitely be given a 4th chance she is trying very hard  has every right to take down the democrat party if she has veered too far left i have just authorized a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum with respect to turkey as their currency the turkish lira slides rapidly downward against our very strong dollar aluminum will now be 20percent and steel 50percent our relations with turkey are not good at this time be happy be cool a football game that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy is no place to protest most of that money goes to the players anyway find another way to protest stand proudly for your national anthem or be suspended without pay the nfl players are at it again taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the national anthem numerous players from different teams wanted to show their outrage at something that most of them are unable to define they make a fortune doing what they love   no evidence to launch even an investigation into potential collusion between donald trump and the russians and here we are a year and a half later jenna ellis  fbi thought they wouldn't get caught because they thought that hillary was going to win there is overt bias and that depends on whether you are democrat or republican a double standard that needs to stop   why didn't the fbi tell president trump that they had concerns about carter page is there a double standard here they told senator diane feinstein that she had a spy but not trump is that entrapment or did they just want to use page as an excuse to spy congressman ted yoho of florida is doing a fantastic job and has my complete and total endorsement tough on crime and borders ted was really helpful on tax cuts vote all the way for ted in the upcoming primary he will never let you down space force all the way this is an illegally brought rigged witch hunt run by people who are totally corrupt and/or conflicted it was started and paid for by crooked hillary and the democrats phony dossier fisa disgrace and so many lying and dishonest people already fired 17 angry dems stay tuned there has been no evidence whatsoever that donald trump or the campaign was involved in any kind of collusion to fix the 2016 election in fact the evidence is the opposite that hillary clinton  the democrats colluded with the russians to fix the 2016 election  red wave congratulations to  of michigan on a job well done also thanks for your great support as long as i campaign and/or support senate and house candidates within reason they will win i

demand a full investigation dan bongino on   looking forward to the new ig report collusion with russia was very real hillary clinton and her team 100percent colluded with the russians and so did adam schiff who is on tape trying to collude with what he thought was russians to obtain compromising material on djt we also know that hillary clinton paid through democrats want open borders and they want to abolish ice the brave men and women that our protecting our country from some of the most vicious and dangerous people on earth sorry we can't let that happenalso change the rules in the senate and approve strong border security presidential approval numbers are very good strong economy military and just about everything else better numbers than obama at this point by far we are winning on just about every front and for that reason there will not be a blue wave but there might be a red wave too bad a large portion of the media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the rigged witch hunt but that is why we call them fake news why aren't mueller and the 17 angry democrats looking at the meetings concerning the fake dossier and all of the lying that went on in the fbi and doj this is the most one sided witch hunt in the history of our country fortunately the facts are all coming out and fast fake news reporting a complete fabrication that i am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son donald had in trump tower this was a meeting to get information on an opponent totally legal and done all the time in politics and it went nowhere i did not know about it because of tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 trillion in debt that has been accumulated much by the obama administration while at the same time reducing taxes for our people at minimum we will make much better trade deals for our country tariffs are working big time every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the us always to our detriment i say as they cometax them if they don't want to be taxed let them make or build the product in the us in either event it means jobs and great wealth the fake news hates me saying that they are the enemy of the people only because they know it's true i am providing a great service by explaining this to the american people they purposely cause great division  distrust they can also cause war they are very dangerous  sick california wildfires are being magnified  made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized it is being diverted into the pacific ocean must also tree clear to stop fire   spreading danny o'connor is a total puppet for nancy pelosi and maxine waters  danny wants to raise

china which is for the first time doing poorly against us is spending a fortune on ads and pr trying to convince and scare our politicians to fight me on tariffs- because they are really hurting their economy likewise other countries we are winning but must be strong tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today only fools would disagree we are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and if countries are still unwilling to negotiate they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of tariffs we win either way tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our steel industry plants are opening all over the us steelworkers are working again and big dollars are flowing into our treasury other countries use tariffs against but when we use them foolish people scream tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated china market has dropped 27percent in last 4months and they are talking to us our market is stronger than ever and will go up dramatically when these horrible trade deals are successfully renegotiated america first happy birthday   troy balderson running for congress from ohio is in a big election fight with a candidate who just got caught

faith leaders from across our nation today at the   we already have a smoking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent it was hillary clinton how is it ok for hillary clinton to proactively seek dirt from the russians but the trump campaign met at the russians request and that is bad marc thiessen washington post looking back on history who was treated worse alfonse capone legendary mob boss killer and public enemy number one or paul manafort political operative  reagan/dole darling now serving solitary confinement although convicted of nothing where is the russian collusion russian collusion with the trump campaign one of the most successful in history is a total hoax the democrats paid for the phony and discredited dossier which was along with comey mccabe strzok and his lover the lovely lisa page used to begin the witch hunt disgraceful paul manafort worked for ronald reagan bob dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders he worked for me for a very short time why didn't government tell me that he was under investigation these old charges have nothing to do with collusion a hoax this is a terrible situation and attorney general jeff sessions should stop this rigged witch hunt right now before it continues to stain our country any further bob mueller is totally conflicted and his 17 angry democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to usa remain in the fbi while he himself was being investigated this is a real issue it won't go into a mueller report because mueller is going to protect these guys mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation alan dershowitz fbi agent peter strzok on the mueller team should have recused himself on day one he was out to stop the election of donald trump he needed an insurance policy those are illegal improper goals trying to influence the election he should never ever been allowed to we already have a smocking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent it was hillary clinton how is it ok for hillary clinton to proactively seek dirt from the russians but the trump campaign met at the russians request and that is bad marc thiessen washington post thank you florida i love you on my way to tampa florida look forward to seeing everyone soon  worker pay rate hits highest level since 2008  border security is national security and national security is the long-term viability of our country a government shutdown is a very small price to pay for a safe and prosperous america i don't care what the political ramifications are our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades and there is no way that the democrats will allow it to be fixed without a government shutdown  has a primary on august 21st he doesn't need any help because he is absolutely outstanding in every way but i hope the great people of wyoming will go out and show their support anyway john

borders loves our military vets and second amendment get out and vote for david on thursday august 2nd he has my full and total endorsement the fake news media is going crazy they are totally unhinged

be gone will be in tampa tonight a big year for  who will be a great governor for florida strong on crime borders and our 2nd amendment big help on tax  regulation cuts loves our military  our vets has my full  total endorsement i am looking into 3-d plastic guns being sold to the public already spoke to nra doesn't seem to make much sense collusion is not a crime but that doesn't matter because there was no collusion except by crooked hillary and the democrats one of the reasons we need great border security is that mexico's murder rate in 2017 increased by 27percent to 31174 people killed a record the democrats want open borders i want maximum border security and respect for ice and our great law enforcement professionals  rush limbaugh is a great guy who truly gets it them richer their network is highly overrated i have beaten them at every turn they want to protect their companies outside the us from being taxed i'm for america first  the american worker a puppet for no one two nice guys with bad ideas make america great again the globalist koch brothers who have become a total joke in real republican circles are against strong borders and powerful trade i never sought their support because i don't need their money or bad ideas they love my tax  regulation cuts judicial picks  more i made making america great again  a highly respected federal judge today stated that the trump administration gets great credit for reuniting illegal families thank you and please look at the previous administrations record not good congratulations to our new  secretary robert wilkie  thank you to  for your yes on a future great justice of the supreme court brett kavanaugh your vote means a lot to me and to everyone who loves our country that open borders large scale crime and abolishing ice is good for them we must get smart and finally do what must be done for the safety and security of our country illegal immigration is a top national security problem after decades of playing games with the whole world laughing at the stupidity of our immigration laws and with democrats thinking congratulations to judge jeanine on the tremendous success of her new  best-selling book liars leakers and liberals  the case against the anti-trump conspiracy your social security and medicare cast your early vote or vote on august 7th election day he has my full and total endorsement  of ohio is running for congress so important to the republican party troy is strong on crime and borders loves our military our vets and our second amendment troy will strongly protect congratulations to general john kelly today we celebrate his first full year as  chief of staff  🇺🇸🇮🇹  it is my great honor to welcome prime minister  of italy to the  join us at 2:00pme for our joint press conference   we must have border security get rid of chain lottery catch  release sanctuary cities go to merit based immigration protect ice and law enforcement and of course keep building but much faster the wall also why is mueller only appointing angry dems some of whom have worked for crooked hillary others including himself have worked for obamaand why isn't mueller looking at all of the criminal activity  real russian collusion on the democrats side-podesta dossier is robert mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to president trump including the fact that we had a very nasty  contentious business relationship i turned him down to head the fbi one day before appointment as sc  comey is his close friend there is no collusion the robert mueller rigged witch hunt headed now by 17 increased from 13 including an obama white house lawyer angry democrats was started by a fraudulent dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc therefore the witch hunt is an illegal scam and the amazon washington post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements and they will never change dying newspaper industry no matter how much they try to distract and cover it up our country is making great progress under my leadership and i will never stop fighting for the american people as an example the failing new york times accurately 90percent of media coverage of my administration is negative despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving it's no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low i will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-trump haters in the when the media driven insane by their trump derangement syndrome reveals internal deliberations of our government it  truly puts the lives of many not just journalists at risk very unpatriotic freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news i would be willing to shut down government if the democrats do not give us the votes for border security which includes the wall must get rid of lottery catch  release etc and finally go to system of immigration based on merit we need great people coming into our country the biggest and best results coming out of the good gdp report was that the quarterly trade deficit has been reduced by $52 billion and of course the historically low unemployment numbers especially for african americans hispanics asians and women had a very good and interesting meeting at the white house with ag sulzberger publisher of the new york times spent much time talking about the vast amounts of fake news being put out by the media  how that fake news has morphed into phrase enemy of the people sad please understand there are consequences when people cross our border illegally whether they have children or not and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes congress must act on fixing the dumbest  worst immigration laws anywhere in the world vote r do you think the fake news media will ever report on this tweet from michael  wow highest poll numbers in the history of the republican party that includes honest abe lincoln and ronald reagan there must be something wrong please recheck that poll tom homan fmr ice director there is nobody that has done more for border security  public safety than president trump i've worked for six presidents

 the only things the democrats do well is resist which is their campaign slogan and obstruct cryin' chuck schumer has almost 400 great american people that are waiting forever to serve our country a total disgrace mitch m should not let them go home until all approved democrats who want open borders and care little about crime are incompetent but they have the fake news media almost totally on

meeting with my son don jr sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam taxi cabs maybe he even retained bill and crooked hillary's lawyer gee i wonder if they helped him make the choice the only collusion with russia was with the democrats so now they are looking at my tweets along with 53 million other people the rigged witch hunt continues how stupid and unfair to our countryand so the fake news doesn't waste my time with dumb questions no arrived back in washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major us steel plant in granite city illinois only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted robert mueller and his gang of 13 angry democrats obviously cannot find collusion way to go jerry this is what the league should do  the remains of american servicemen will soon be leaving north korea and heading to the united states after so many years this will be a great moment for so many families thank you to kim jong un america is open for business and us steel is back  called the case against impeaching trump which i would encourage all people with trump derangement syndrome to read  a brilliant lawyer who although a liberal democrat who probably didn't vote for me has discussed the witch hunt with great clarity and in a very positive way he has written a new and very

night wow 69-30 those are big numbers now go win against the open border crime loving opponent that the democrats have given you she is weak on vets the military and the 2nd amendment win what kind of a lawyer would tape a client so sad is this a first never heard of it before why was the tape so abruptly terminated cut while i was presumably saying positive things i hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped can this be so too bad china is targeting our farmers who they know i love  respect as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the us they are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt we were being nice until now china made $517 billion on us last year when you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation it will only take longer to make a deal and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity negotiations are going really well be cool the end result will be worth it every time i see a weak politician asking to stop trade talks or the use of tariffs to counter unfair tariffs i wonder what can they be thinking are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off  lost $817 billion on trade last year no weakness the russia hoax the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton  frame donald trump is a hot seller already number one more importantly it is a great book that everyone is talking about it covers the rigged witch hunt brilliantly congratulations to gregg jarrett so sad and unfair that the fcc wouldn't approve the sinclair broadcast merger with tribune this would have been a great and much needed conservative voice for and of the people liberal fake news nbc and comcast gets approved much bigger but not sinclair disgraceful the european union is coming to washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on trade i have an idea for them both the us and the eu drop all tariffs barriers and subsidies that would finally be called free market and fair trade hope they do it we are ready but they won't today it was my great honor to be in kansas city missouri to pay tribute to the men and women who make freedom possible thank you    on the heels of the very successful launch of the  national council for the american worker congress should reauthorize  and ensure the american workforce remains stronger than ever   i want to thank the  for your devotion to our fallen heroes unknown soldiers prisoners of war those missing in action and their families      i'm very concerned that russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming election based on the fact that no president has been tougher on russia than me they will be pushing very hard for the democrats they definitely don't want trump make america great again heading to missouri to be with many of my great friends vfw here we come our country is doing great best financial numbers on the planet great to have usa winning again today is the day to vote for brian kemp will be great for georgia full endorsement  tariffs are the greatest either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with tariffs it's as simple as that and everybody's talking remember we are the piggy bank that's being robbed all will be great countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to washington to negotiate this should have taken place many years ago butas the saying goes better late than never  showcase  lou barletta was one of my first supporters he is tough on crime and borders will be a great senator from pennsylvania his opponent is weak on crime ice and borders we need lou  robert will do a great job for our vets we also recently won choice  in my opinion the washington post is nothing more than an expensive the paper loses a fortune lobbyist for amazon is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought the amazon washington post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the internet tax case in the us supreme court two months ago next up is the us post office which they use at a fraction of real cost as their delivery boy for a big percentage of their packages a rocket has not been launched by north korea in 9 months likewise no nuclear tests japan is happy all of asia is happy but the fake news is saying without ever asking me always anonymous sources that i am angry because it is not going fast enough wrong very happy when you hear the fake news talking negatively about my meeting with president putin and all that i gave up remember i gave up nothing we merely talked about future benefits for both countries also we got along very well which is a good thing except for the corrupt media carter page wasn't a spy wasn't an agent of the russians he would have cooperated with the fbi it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump tom fitton  a disgrace to america they should drop the discredited mueller witch hunt now and the doj fbi and obama gang need to be held to account source  was the major source avoided talking about it being the clinton campaign behind it misled the court to provide a pretext to spy on the trump team not about carter pagewas all about getting trump it was classified to cover up misconduct by the fbi and the justice department in misleading the court by using this dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the trump team this is a clinton campaign document it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump so we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and fake dirty dossier that was paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the dnc that was knowingly  falsely submitted to fisa and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited mueller witch hunt tom fitton on  at 6:15 am now judicial watch to iranian president rouhani never ever threaten the united states again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before we are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence  death be cautious so president obama knew about russia before the election why didn't he do something about it why didn't he tell our campaign because it is all a big hoax that's why and he thought crooked hillary was going to win happy birthday   i had a great meeting with putin and the fake news used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it so bad for our country  on   source  was the fake dossier yes the dirty dossier paid for by democrats as a hit piece against trump and looking for information that could discredit candidate  trump carter page was just the foot to surveil the trump campaign illegal andrew mccarthy i said this could never happen this is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff not just the people who gave it it is so bad it screams out at you  on the whole fisa scam which led to the rigged mueller witch hunt watching los angeles possible hostage situation very closely active barricaded suspect lapd working with federal law enforcement looking more  more like the trump campaign for president was illegally being spied upon surveillance for the political gain of crooked hillary clinton and the dnc ask her how that worked out she did better with crazy bernie republicans must get tough now an illegal scam congratulations to  and  on being successful in getting the carter page fisa documents as usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the department of justice and fbi misled the courts witch hunt rigged a scam troy balderson of ohio is running for congress against a nancy pelosi liberal who is weak on crime  borders troy is the total opposite and loves our military vets  2nd amendment early voting just started with election day on august 7th troy has my full  total endorsement brian kemp who is running for governor of georgia and has my full endorsement is campaigning tonight with vp  brian is very strong on crime and borders loves our military vets and the 2nd amendment he will be a great governor no collusion no obstruction but that doesn't matter because the 13 angry democrats who are only after republicans and totally protecting democrats want this witch hunt to drag out to the november election republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing the rigged witch hunt headed by the 13 angry democrats and now 4 more have been added one who worked directly for obama wh seems intent on damaging the republican party's chances in the november election this democrat excuse for losing the ‘16 election never ends inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer's office early in the morning almost unheard of even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client totally unheard of  perhaps illegal the good news is that your favorite president did nothing wrong brian kemp who is running for governor of georgia and has my full endorsement is campaigning tonight with  brian is very strong on crime and borders loves our military vets and the 2nd amendment he will be a great governor the nfl national anthem debate is alive and well again can't believe it isn't it in contract that players must stand at attention hand on heart the $40000000 commissioner must now make a stand first time kneeling out for game second time kneeling out for season/no pay i got severely criticized by the fake news media for being too nice to president putin in the old days they would call it diplomacy if i was loud  vicious i would have been criticized for being too tough remember when they said i was too tough with chairman kim hypocrites so important should have been done years ago  farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years the price of soybeans has fallen 50percent since 5 years before the election a big reason is bad terrible trade deals with other countries they put on massive tariffs and barriers canada charges 275percent on dairy farmers will win the united states should not be penalized because we are doing so well tightening now hurts all that we have done the us should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and bad trade deals debt coming due  we are raising rates really china the european union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower while the us is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day taking away our big competitive edge as usual not a level playing field my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in missouri such a tragedy such a great loss may god be with you all will the dems and fake news ever learn this is classic  trump recognized russian meddling many times  proliferation cyber attacks trade ukraine middle east peace north korea and more there are many answers some easy and some hard to these problemsbut they can all be solved the summit with russia was a great success except with the real enemy of the people the fake news media i look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed including stopping terrorism security for israel nuclear i told you so the european union just slapped a five billion dollar fine on one of our great companies google they truly have taken advantage of the us but not for long really big jobs meeting today at the white house 3 pm trump recognized russian meddling many times thank you to  and  for actually showing the clips the fake news wants no part of that narrative too bad they don't want to focus on all of the economic and jobs records being set the fake news media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with russia even a confrontation that could lead to war they are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that i'll probably have a good relationship with putin we are doing much better than any other country the fake news media is going crazy they make up stories without any backup sources or proof many of the stories written about me and the good people surrounding me are total fiction problem is when you complain you just give them more publicity but i'll complain anyway the democrats have a death wish in more ways than one they actually want to abolish ice this should cost them heavily in the midterms yesterday the republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ice thank you to novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs likewise to pfizer we are making a big push to actually reduce the prices maybe substantially on prescription drugs a total disgrace that turkey will not release a respected us pastor andrew brunson from prison he has been held hostage far too long  should do something to free this wonderful christian husband  father he has done nothing wrong and his family needs him trump recognized russian meddling many times  the two biggest opponents of ice in america today are the democratic party and ms-13 thank you to congressman kevin yoder he secured $5 billion for border security now we need congress to support kevin has been strong on crime the border the 2nd amendment and he loves our military and vets  has my full and total endorsement brian kemp is running for governor of the great state of georgia the primary is on tuesday brian is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration he loves our military and our vets and protects our second amendment i give him my full and total endorsement 34 million jobs created since our great election victory far greater than ever anticipated and only getting better as new and greatly improved trade deals start coming to fruition some people hate the fact that i got along well with president putin of russia they would rather go to war than see this it's called trump derangement syndrome a lot of democrats wished they voted for the tax cuts because the economy is booming we could have 4percent growth now and the fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again     congratulations to martha roby of the great state of alabama on her big gop primary win for congress my endorsement came appropriately late but when it came the flood gates opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve enjoy russia has agreed to help with north korea where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along there is no rush the sanctions remain big benefits and exciting future for north korea at end of process while the nato meeting in brussels was an acknowledged triumph with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace the meeting with russia may prove to be in the long run an even greater success many positive things will come out of that meeting so many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in helsinki putin and i discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting we got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match big results will come prosperity is returning donald trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate now as the most effective president the most successful president in modern american history thank you to the great lou dobbs the democrats want to abolish ice which will mean more crime in our country i want to give ice a big cheer vote republican in november the meeting between president putin and myself was a great success except in the fake news media the economy of the united states is stronger than ever before thank you  the president has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations what's he supposed to think while i had a great meeting with nato raising vast amounts of money i had an even better meeting with vladimir putin of russia sadly it is not being reported that way the fake news is going crazy i had a great meeting with nato they have paid $33 billion more and will pay hundreds of billions of dollars more in the future only because of me nato was weak but now it is strong again bad for russia the media only says i was rude to leaders never mentions the money thank you  you really get it the president has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations what's he supposed think will be interviewed on  tonight at 9pme and  tomorrow night at 8pme enjoy a productive dialogue is not only good for the united states and good for russia but it is good for the world   i would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics   as i said today and many times before i have great confidence in my intelligence people however i also recognize that in order to build a brighter future we cannot exclusively focus on the past  as the world's two largest nuclear powers we must get along  thank you helsinki finland  joint press conference from helsinki finland  it was an honor to join you this morning thank you  our relationship with russia has never been worse thanks to many years of us foolishness and stupidity and now the rigged witch hunt president obama thought that crooked hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the fbi about russian meddling he said it couldn't happen was no big deal  did nothing about it when i won it became a big deal and the rigged witch hunt headed by strzok received many calls from leaders of nato countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations both present  future we had a truly great summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media nato is now strong  rich congratulations to france who played extraordinary soccer on winning the 2018 world cup additionally congratulations to president putin and russia for putting on a truly great world cup tournament -- one of the best ever know how to do is resist and obstruct this is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country  but at some point it will heal over the years i would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough  that i should have gotten saint petersburg in addition much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the dems heading to helsinki finland  looking forward to meeting with president putin tomorrow unfortunately no matter how well i do at the summit if i was given the great city of moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by russia there hasn't been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in north korea there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages who knows how it will all turn out in the end but why isn't the fake news talking about these wonderful facts because it is fake news these russian individuals did their work during the obama years why didn't obama do something about it  because he thought crooked hillary clinton would win that's why had nothing to do with the trump administration but fake news doesn't want to report the truth as usual our prayers are with those affected by the flooding in japan we commend the rescue efforts and offer condolences to all who were injured or lost loved ones  remember it was little jeff z and his people who are told exactly what to say who said i could not win the election in that there was no way to 270 over  over again in the electoral college i got 306 they were sooooo wrong in their election coverage still hurting so funny i just checked out fake news cnn for the first time in a long time they are dying in the ratings to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of jim acosta actually a nice guy they didn't but they did say i already lost in my meeting with putin fake news the stories you heard about the 12 russians yesterday took place during the obama administration not the trump administration why didn't they do something about it especially when it was reported that president obama was informed by the fbi in september before the election where is the dnc server and why didn't the fbi take possession of it deep state the stories you heard about the 12 russians yesterday took place during the obama administration not the trump administrations why didn't they do something about it especially when it was reported that president obama was informed by the fbi in september before the election the stock market hit 25000 yesterday jobs are at an all time record and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government it is all happening i have arrived in scotland and will be at trump turnberry for two days of meetings calls and hopefully some golf my primary form of exercise the weather is beautiful and this place is incredible tomorrow i go to helsinki for a monday meeting with vladimir putin this is now changing for the first time  🇺🇸🇬🇧  joint press conference with prime minister theresa may congressman matt gaetz of florida is one of the finest and most talented people in congress strong on crime the border illegal immigration the 2nd amendment our great military  vets matt worked tirelessly on helping to get our massive tax cuts he has my full endorsement great success today at nato billions of additional dollars paid by members since my election great spirit a very nice note from chairman kim of north korea great progress being made  trump has been the most consequential president in history when it comes to minority employment in june for instance the unemployment rate for hispanics and latinos 16 years and older fell to 46percent its lowest level ever from 49percent in may  thank you    press conference in brussels belgium on top of it all germany just started paying russia the country they want protection from billions of dollars for their energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from russia not acceptable all nato nations must meet their 2percent commitment and that must ultimately go to 4percent presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get germany and other rich nato nations to pay more toward their protection from russia they pay only a fraction of their cost the us pays tens of billions of dollars too much to subsidize europe and loses big on trade as i head out to a very important nato meeting i see that fbi lover/agent lisa page is dodging a subpoena  is refusing to show up and testify what can she possibly say about her statements and lies so much corruption on the other side where is the attorney general  billions of additional dollars are being spent by nato countries since my visit last year at my request but it isn't nearly enough us spends too much europe's borders are bad pipeline dollars to russia are not acceptable how can the rigged witch hunt proceed when it was started influenced and worked on for an extended period of time by former fbi agent/lover peter strzok read his hate filled and totally biased emails and the answer is clear ex-fbi layer lisa page today defied a house of representatives issued subpoena to testify before congress wow but is anybody really surprised  together with her lover fbi agent peter strzok she worked on the rigged witch hunt perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case ever if the democrats want to win supreme court and other court picks don't obstruct and resist but rather do it the good ol' fashioned way win elections what good is nato if germany is paying russia billions of dollars for gas and energy why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment the us is paying for europe's protection then loses billions on trade must pay 2percent of gdp immediately not by 2025 democrats in congress must no longer obstruct vote to fix our terrible immigration laws now i am watching what is going on from europe it would be soooo simple to fix judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works they are just using children things up better than ever before but it can't go too quickly i am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers and will win i am in brussels but always thinking about our farmers soy beans fell 50percent from 2012 to my election farmers have done poorly for 15 years other countries' trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses i will open bilateral breakfast with nato secretary general in brussels belgium  what good is nato if germany is paying russia billions of dollars for gas and energy why are their only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment the us is paying for europe's protection then loses billions on trade must pay 2percent of gdp immediately not by 2025 just talked with pfizer ceo and  on our drug pricing blueprint pfizer is rolling back price hikes so american patients don't pay more we applaud pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same great news for the american people the european union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in europe us has a $151 billion trade deficit and then they want us to happily defend them through nato and nicely pay for it just doesn't work a recent emerson college epoll said that most americans especially hispanics feel that they are better off under president trump than they were under president obama many countries in nato which we are expected to defend are not only short of their current commitment of 2percent which is low but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made will they reimburse the us informing the republican senators of my nomination of judge brett kavanaugh   i am on air force one flying to nato and hear reports that the fbi lovers peter strzok and lisa page are getting cold feet on testifying about  the rigged witch hunt headed by 13 angry democrats and people that worked for obama for 8 years total disgrace on behalf of the united states congratulations to the thai navy seals and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in thailand such a beautiful moment all freed great job thank you to all of my great supporters really big progress being made other countries wanting to fix crazy trade deals economy is roaring supreme court pick getting great reviews new poll says trump at over 90percent is the most popular republican in history of the party wow nato countries must pay more the united states must pay less very unfair getting ready to leave for europe first meeting nato the us is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them not fair to the us taxpayer on top of that we lose $151 billion on trade with the european union charge us big tariffs  barriers tonight it was my honor and privilege to nominate judge brett kavanaugh to the united states supreme court   happy 100th birthday to our amazing current and former army warrant officers thank you for your century of service as the indispensable guardians of our great  technology   pfizer  others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason they are merely taking advantage of the poor  others unable to defend themselves while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in europe  elsewhere we will respond the failing ny times fake news story today about breast feeding must be called out the us strongly supports breast feeding but we don't believe women should be denied access to formula many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty i have confidence that kim jong un will honor the contract we signed  even more importantly our handshake we agreed to the denuclearization of north korea china on the other hand may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on chinese trade-hope not i have long heard that the most important decision a us president can make is the selection of a supreme court justice will be announced tonight at 9:00 pm europe far more than it does the us by some accounts the us is paying for 90percent of nato with many countries nowhere close to their 2percent commitment on top of this the european union has a trade surplus of $151 million with the us with big trade barriers on us goods no the united states is spending far more on nato than any other country this is not fair nor is it acceptable while these countries have been increasing their contributions since i took office they must do much more germany is at 1percent the us is at 4percent and nato benefits they just didn't get it but they do now  looking forward to announcing my final decision on the united states supreme court justice at 9:00pme tomorrow night at the  an exceptional person will be chosen iranian harassment of us warships:2015 222016 362017 142018 0source  the us is working very closely with the government of thailand to help get all of the children out of the cave and to safety very brave and talented people the rigged witch hunt originally headed by fbi lover boy peter s for one year  now 13 angry democrats should look into the missing dnc server crooked hillary's illegally deleted emails the pakistani fraudster uranium one podesta  so much more it's a democrat con job public opinion has turned strongly against the rigged witch hunt and the special counsel because the public understands that there was no  collusion with russia so ridiculous that the two fbi lovers were a fraud against our nation  that the only collusion was with the dems big decision will soon be made on our next justice of the supreme court twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace will that include the failing new york times and propaganda machine for amazon the washington post who constantly quote anonymous sources that in my opinion don't exist they will both be out of business in 7 years public opinion has turned strongly against the rigged witch hunt and the special councel because the public understands that there was no  collusion with russia so ridiculous that the two fbi lovers were a fraud against our nation  that the only collusion was with the dems just won lawsuit filed by the dnc and a bunch of democrat crazies trying to claim the trump campaign and others colluded with russia they haven't figured out that this was an excuse for them losing the election jobs jobs jobs  thanks to republican leadership america is winning again and america is being respected again all over the world because we are finally putting america first every day the brave men and women of ice are liberating communities from savage gangs like ms-13 we will not stand for these vile democrat smears in law enforcement we will always stand

progress and the future of the epa is very bright i have accepted the resignation of scott pruitt as the administrator of the environmental protection agency within the agency scott has done an outstanding job and i will always be thankful to him for this the senate confirmed deputy at epa andrew wheeler will congress fix our insane immigration laws now country being forced to endure a long and costly trial tell the people out and they must leave just as they would if they were standing on your front lawn hiring thousands of judges does not work and is not acceptable only country in the world that does this congress must pass smart fast and reasonable immigration laws now law enforcement at the border is doing a great job but the laws they are forced to work with are insane when people with or without children enter our country they must be told to leave without our happy birthday america  the opec monopoly must remember that gas prices are up  they are doing little to help

independence thank you  jim justice for that warm introduction tonight it was my great honor to attend the greenbrier classic  salute to service dinner in west virginia god bless our veterans god bless america and happy independence day to all  after having written many best selling books and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write it should be noted that the fake news constantly likes to pore over my tweets looking for a mistake i capitalize certain words only for emphasis not b/c they should be capitalized the washington post is constantly quoting anonymous sources that do not exist rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for they are a disgrace to journalism but then again so are many others heading to west virginia to be with my friend  jim justice at his beautiful greenbrier resort he works hard does a great job and raises lots of money for charities wow the nsa has deleted 685 million phone calls and text messages privacy violations they blame technical irregularities such a disgrace the witch hunt continues now that harley-davidson is moving part of its operation out of the us my administration is working with other motor cycle companies who want to move into the us harley customers are not happy with their move sales are down 7percent in 2017 the us is where the action is just out that the obama administration granted citizenship during the terrible iran deal negotiation to 2500 iranians including to government officials how big and bad is that many good conversations with north korea-it is going well in the meantime no rocket launches or nuclear testing in 8 months all of asia is thrilled only the opposition party which includes the fake news is complaining if not for me we would now be at war with north korea how can the democrats who are weak on the border and weak on crime do well in november the people of our country want and demand safety and security while the democrats are more interested in  ripping apart and demeaning and not properly funding our great law enforcement when we have an infestation of ms-13 gangs in certain parts of our country who do we send to get them out ice they are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country dems do not appreciate the great job they do nov the economy is doing perhaps better than ever before and that's prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair trade deals ever made by any country in any event they are coming along very well most countries agree that they must be changed but nobody ever asked i interviewed 4 very impressive people yesterday on monday i will be announcing my decision for justice of the united states supreme court just arrived in west virginia  crazy maxine waters said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics is rapidly becoming together with nancy pelosi the face of the democrat party her ranting and raving even referring to herself as a wounded animal will make people flee the democrats after having written many best selling books and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write it should be noted that the fake news constantly likes to pour over my tweets looking for a mistake i capitalize certain words only for emphasis not b/c they should be capitalized the washington post is constantly quoting anonymous sources that do not exist rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for they are a discgrace to journalism but then again so are many others many democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their leadership wants to denounce and abandon the

court upholds trump travel ban wow the most profound question of our era was there a conspiracy in the obama department of justice and the fbi to prevent donald trump from becoming president of the us and was strzok at the core of the conspiracy  judge andrew napolitano the face of the democrats is now maxine waters who together with nancy pelosi have established a fine leadership team they should

great economy go out and vote for henry today he will never let you down we are finishing our study of tariffs on cars from the eu in that they have long taken advantage of the us in the form of trade barriers and tariffs in the end it will all even out and it won't take very long when i had harley-davidson officials over to the white house i chided them about tariffs in other countries like india being too high companies are now coming back to america harley must know that they won't be able to sell back into us without paying a big tax we are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers workers and companies we are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint they must play fair or they will pay tariffs early this year harley-davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in kansas city to thailand that was long before tariffs were announced hence they were just using tariffs/trade war as an excuse shows how unbalanced  unfair trade is but we will fix it thank you south carolina now let's get out tomorrow and vote for   just landed in south carolina will be at the mcmaster rally shortly  the hearing of peter strzok and the other hating frauds at the fbi  doj should be shown to the public on live television not a closed door hearing that nobody will see we should expose these people for what they are there should be total transparency why is senator mark warner d-va perhaps in a near drunken state claiming he has information that only he and bob mueller the leader of the 13 angry democrats on a witch hunt knows isn't this highly illegal is it being investigated director david lynch trump could go down as one of the greatest presidents  surprised that harley-davidson of all companies would be the first to wave the white flag i fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the eu which has hurt us badly on trade down $151 billion taxes just a harley excuse be patient   congresswoman maxine waters an extraordinarily low iq person has become together with nancy pelosi the face of the democrat party she has just called for harm to supporters of which there are many of the make america great again movement be careful what you wish for max will be heading to one of my favorite places south carolina to fight for one of my original fighters governor henry mcmaster speaking at 7:00 pm if this is done illegal immigration will be stopped in it's tracks and at very little by comparison cost this is the only real answer and we must continue to build the wall hiring manythousands of judges and going through a long and complicated legal process is not the way to go will always be disfunctional people must simply be stopped at the border and told they cannot come into the us illegally children brought back to their country such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the obama administration and ours actually we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under obama fake news is working overtime i have tried to stay uninvolved with the department of justice and fbi although i do not legally have to because of the now totally discredited and very expensive witch hunt currently going on but you do have to

and are vets he is tough on crime and has my full endorsement the great state of louisiana we want clay the red hen restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies doors and windows badly needs a paint job rather than refusing to serve a fine person like sarah huckabee sanders i always had a rule if a restaurant is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside former attorney general michael mukasey said that president trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on trump tower actually far greater than would ever have been believed  has been a great help to me on cutting taxes creating great new healthcare programs at low cost fighting for border security our military and are vets he is tough on crime and has my full endorsement the great state of louisiana we want clay house republicans could easily pass a bill on strong border security but remember it still has to pass in the senate and for that we need 10 democrat votes and all they do is resist they want open borders and don't care about crime need more republicans to win in november  is now whimpering to all that he did the famous hair show with me where he seriously messed up my hair  that he would have now done it differently because it is said to have humanized me-he is taking heat he called  said monster ratings be a man jimmy the united states is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial trade barriers and tariffs on goods going into their country remove those barriers  tariffs or be met with more than reciprocity by the usa trade must be fair and no longer a one way street our immigration policy laughed at all over the world is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years immigration must be based on merit we need people who will help to make america great again we cannot allow all of these people to invade our country when somebody comes in we must immediately with no judges or court cases bring them back from where they came our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and law and order most children come without parents democrats fix the laws don't resist we are doing a far better job than bush and obama but we need strength and security at the border cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our country strong borders no crime major wall street journal opinion piece today talking about the russian witch hunt and the disgrace that it is so many people hurt so bad for our country a total sham america is open for business  thank you    happy birthday to supreme court

the association's history the russian witch hunt is rigged   poll numbers plummet on the democrat inspired and paid for russian witch hunt with all of the bias lying and hate by the investigators

is secure our citizens are safe and we finally end the immigration crisis once and for all  we are gathered today to hear directly from the american victims of illegal immigration these are the american citizens permanently separated from their loved ones b/c they were killed by criminal illegal aliens these are the families the media ignores hope opec will increase output substantially need to keep prices down we must maintain a strong southern border we cannot allow our country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief hoping it will help them in the elections obama and others had the same pictures and did nothing about it 80percent of mexico's exports come to the united states they totally rely on us which is fine with me

the 13 angry democrats leading the witch hunt   had a great meeting with the house gop last night at the capitol they applauded and laughed loudly when i mentioned my experience with mark sanford i have never been a fan of his more records   fbi texts have revealed anti-trump bias   big news but the fake news doesn't want to cover total corruption the witch hunt has turned out to be a scam at some point soon the mainstream media will have to cover correctly too big a story it's the democrats fault they won't give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation they want open borders which breeds horrible crime republicans want security but i am working on something it never ends the fake news is not mentioning the safety and security of our country when talking about illegal immigration our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world and the dems will do anything not to change them  to obstruct-want open borders which means crime thank you   earlier today  melania and i were honored to welcome king felipe vi and queen letizia of spain to the 🇺🇸🇪🇸  homeland security  did a fabulous job yesterday at the press conference explaining security at the border and for our country while at the same time recommending changes to obsolete  nasty laws which force family separation we want heart and security in america i want to take a moment to address the current illegal immigration crisis on the southern borderit has been going on for many many decades  thank you    join me tomorrow in duluth minnesota for a  rally tickets      now is the best opportunity ever for congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration get it done always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security we must always arrest people coming into our country illegally of the 12000 children 10000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip and only 2000 are with their parents many of whom have tried to enter our country illegally on numerous occasions democrats are the problem they don't care about crime and want illegal immigrants no matter how bad they may be to pour into and infest our country like ms-13 they can't win on their terrible policies so they view them as potential voters if you don't have borders you don't have a country crime in germany is up 10percent plus officials do not want to report these crimes since migrants were accepted others countries are even worse be smart america i can't think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election inspector general horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election a rigged witch huntp comey gave strozk his marching orders mueller is comey's best friend witch hunt if president obama who got nowhere with north korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed had gotten along with north korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that i have the fake news would have named him a national hero it is the democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with boarder security and crime tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by crime coming from illegal immigration change the laws change the laws children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country has anyone been looking at the crime taking place south of the border it is historic with some countries the most dangerous places in the world not going to happen in the us we don't want what is happening with immigration in europe to happen with us the people of germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous berlin coalition crime in germany is way up big mistake made all over europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture why don't the democrats give us the votes to fix the world's worst immigration laws where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs including ms-13 coming into our country illegally the highest level of bias i've ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer trey gowdy on the fbi's own peter strzok also remember that they all worked for slippery james comey and that comey is best friends with robert mueller a really sick deal isn't it the democrats should get together with their republican counterparts and work something out on border security  safety don't wait until after the election because you are going to lose why was the fbi's sick loser peter strzok working on the totally discredited mueller team of 13 angry  conflicted democrats when strzok was giving crooked hillary a free pass yet telling his lover lawyer lisa page that we'll stop trump from becoming president witch hunt why was the fbi giving so much information to the fake news media they are not supposed to be doing that and knowing the enemy of the people fake news they put their own spin on it truth doesn't matter to them witch hunt there was no russian collusion oh i see there was no russian collusion so now they look for obstruction on the no russian collusion the phony russian collusion was a made up hoax too bad they didn't look at crooked hillary like this double standard washington post employees want to go on strike because bezos isn't paying them enough i think a really long strike would be a great idea employees would get more money and we would get rid of fake news for an extended period of time is  a registered lobbyist our economy is perhaps better than it has ever been companies doing really well and moving back to america and jobs numbers are the best in 44 years the denuclearization deal with north korea is being praised and celebrated all over asia they are so happy over here in our country some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give trump a win even if it does save potentially millions  millions of lives holding back the war games during the negotiations was my request because they are very expensive and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation also quite provocative can start up immediately if talks break down which i hope will not happen funny how the fake news in a coordinated effort with each other likes to say i gave sooo much to north korea because i met that's because that's all they have to disparage we got so much for peace in the world  more is being added in finals even got our hostages/remains daniel henninger of the wall street journal this ig report makes it clear as did rod rosenstein's memo that trump was absolutely justified unquestionably justified in firing jim comey so i think the mueller investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now  witch hunt please clear up the fake news  chuck schumer said the summit was what the texans call all cattle and no hat thank you chuck but are you sure you got that right no more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place blew up launch sites hostages already back hero remains coming home  much more the ig report totally destroys james comey and all of his minions including the great lovers peter strzok and lisa page who started the disgraceful witch hunt against so many innocent people it will go down as a dark and dangerous period in american history my supporters are the smartest strongest most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history it is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country as we get stronger so does our country best numbers ever democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the border by working with republicans on new legislation for a change this is why we need more republicans elected in november democrats are good at only three things high taxes high crime and obstruction sad the ig report totally distroys james comey and all of his minions including the great lovers peter strzok and lisa page who started the disgraceful witch hunt against so many innocent people it will go down as a dark and dangerous period in american history great discussions with european union commission president jean-claude juncker and eu council president donald tusk at the  in canada last week  the fake news media said that i did not get along with other leaders at the  in canada they are once again wrong  i have a great relationship with angela merkel of germany but the fake news media only shows the bad photos implying anger of negotiating an agreement where i am asking for things that no other american president would ask for  i've had to beat 17 very talented people including the bush dynasty then i had to beat the clinton dynasty and now i have to beat a phony witch hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the ig reportand never forget the fake news media it never ends wow what a tough sentence for paul manafort who has represented ronald reagan bob dole and many other top political people and campaigns didn't know manafort was the head of the mob what about comey and crooked hillary and all of the others very unfair the democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda any immigration bill must have full funding for the wall end catch  release visa lottery and chain and go to merit based immigration go for it win donald trump was 100percent right to fire james comey mark levin why in the world didn't barack obama fire this guy comey asks mark levin wow the highest rated by far morning show  is on the front lawn of the white house maybe i'll have to take an unannounced trip down to see them usa jobs numbers are the best in 44 years if my opponent the democrats had won the election they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations the economy and jobs would have been a disaster thank you for all of the compliments on getting the world cup to come to the usa mexico and canada i worked hard on this along with a great team of talented people we never fail and it will be a great world cup a special thanks to bob kraft for excellent advice the ig report is a total disaster for comey his minions and sadly the fbi comey will now officially go down as the worst leader by far in the history of the fbi i did a great service to the people in firing him good instincts christopher wray will bring it proudly back fbi agent peter strzok who headed the clinton  russia investigations texted to his lover lisa page in the ig report that we'll stop candidate trump from becoming president doesn't get any lower than that happy 🇺🇸  happy 243rd birthday to the  thank you for your bravery sacrifices and dedication to the usa we love you  schneiderman who ran the clinton campaign in new york never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case which lingered in their office for almost 2 years now he resigned his office in disgrace and his disciples brought it when we would not settle the sleazy new york democrats and their now disgraced and run out of town ag eric schneiderman are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18800000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in $19200000 i won't settle this case so the democrats make up a phony crime collusion with the russians pay a fortune to make the crime sound real illegally leak comey classified information so that a special councel will be appointed and then collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in fake news now that i am back from singapore where we had a great result with respect to north korea the thought process must sadly go back to the witch hunt always remembering that there was no collusion and no obstruction of the fabricated no crime the republican party is starting to show very big numbers people are starting to see what is being done results are speaking loudly north korea and our greatest ever economy are leading the way congratulations to  on his huge win in north dakota we need kevin in the senate and i strongly endorse him heidi voted no on our tax cuts and always will vote no when we need her kevin is strong on crime  borders big on cutting taxes congratulations to danny tarkanian on his big gop primary win in nevada danny worked hard an got a great result looking good in november senator claire mccaskill of the great state of missouri flew around in a luxurious private jet during her rv tour of the state rv's are not for her people are really upset so phony josh hawley should win big and has my full endorsement so funny to watch the fake news especially nbc and cnn they are fighting hard to downplay the deal with north korea 500 days ago they would have begged for this deal-looked like war would break out our country's biggest enemy is the fake news so easily promulgated by fools oil prices are too high opec is at it again not good the us together with mexico and canada just got the world cup congratulations a great deal of hard work we save a fortune by not doing war games as long as we are negotiating in good faith which both sides are before taking office people were assuming that we were going to war with north korea president obama said that north korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem no longer sleep well tonight just landed a long trip but everybody can now feel much safer than the day i took office there is no longer a nuclear threat from north korea meeting with kim jong un was an interesting and very positive experience north korea has great potential for the

we must put the american worker first great to be in singapore excitement in the air germany pays 1percent slowly of gdp towards nato while we pay 4percent of a much larger gdp does anybody believe that makes sense we protect europe which is good at great financial loss and then get unfairly clobbered on trade change is coming and add to that the fact that the us pays close to the entire cost of nato-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on trade they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh the european union had a $151 billion surplus-should pay much more for military why should i as president of the united states allow countries to continue to make massive trade surpluses as they have for decades while our farmers workers  taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay not fair to the people of america $800 billion trade deficit fair trade is now to be called fool trade if it is not reciprocal according to a canada release they make almost 100 billion dollars in trade with us guess they were bragging and got caught minimum is 17b tax dairy from us at 270percent then justin acts hurt when called out pm justin trudeau of canada acted so meek and mild during our  meetings only to give a news conference after i left saying that us tariffs were kind of insulting and he will not be pushed around very dishonest  weak our tariffs are in response to his of 270percent on dairy based on justin's false statements at his news conference and the fact that canada is charging massive tariffs to our us farmers workers and companies i have instructed our us reps not to endorse the communique as we look at tariffs on automobiles flooding the us market create peace and great prosperity for his land i look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity will not be wasted i am on my way to singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for north korea and the world it will certainly be an exciting day and i know that kim jong-un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before the united states will not allow other countries to impose massive tariffs and trade barriers on its farmers workers and companies while sending their product into our country tax free we have put up with trade abuse for many decades  and that is long enough usa trade they fully understand where i am coming from after many decades fair and reciprocal trade will happen just left the  summit in beautiful canada great meetings and relationships with the six country leaders especially since they know i cannot allow them to apply large tariffs and strong barriers to just met the new prime minister of italy  a really great guy he will be honored in washington at the  shortly he will do a great job the

and iran we don't need his advice why isn't the european union and canada informing the public that for years they have used massive trade tariffs and non-monetary trade barriers against the us totally unfair to our farmers workers  companies take down your tariffs  barriers or we will more than match you prime minister trudeau is being so indignant bringing up the relationship that the us and canada had over the many years and all sorts of other thingsbut he doesn't bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300percent on dairy  hurting our farmers killing our agriculture please tell

death to facelift to left the wh and me for ny or virginia to abuse all fake she is doing really well gold star father ceejay metcalf whose great son michael was just honored at the white house was

our national anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling sorry big supreme court ruling for baker just out in many ways this is the greatest economy in the history of america and the best time ever to look for a job the fake news media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony russian witch hunt  of american greatness   the appointment of the special counsel is totally unconstitutional despite that we play the game because i unlike the democrats have done nothing wrong farmers have not been doing well for 15 years mexico canada china and others have treated them unfairly by the time i finish trade talks that will change big trade barriers against us farmers and other businesses will finally be broken massive trade deficits no longer the us has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only win china already charges a tax of 16percent on soybeans canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our agricultural products not acceptable as has been stated by numerous legal scholars i have the absolute right to pardon myself but why would i do that when i have done nothing wrong in the meantime the never ending witch hunt led by 13 very angry and conflicted democrats  others continues into the mid-terms this is the best time ever to look for a job james freeman of wsj we had repeal  replace done and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars except for one person but it is getting done anyway individual mandate is gone and great less expensive plans will be

regulation cuts military  vets lower crime  illegal immigration stronger borders judgeships best economy  jobs ever and much more the appointment of the special councel is totally unconstitutional despite that we play the game because i unlike the democrats have done nothing wrong mark penn  why are there people from the clinton foundation on the mueller staff why is there an independent counsel to go after people and their families for unrelated offensesconstitution was set up to prevent thisstormtrooper tactics almost a disgrace paul manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time he represented ronald reagan bob dole  many others over the years but we should have been told that comey and the boys were doing a number on him and he wouldn't have been hired as only one of two people left who could become president why wouldn't the fbi or department of justice have told me that they were secretly investigating paul manafort on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped during my campaign should have told me jesse watters the only thing trump obstructed was hillary getting to the white house  so true mark penn  why are there people from the clinton foundation on the mueller staff why is there an independent councel to go after people and their families for unrelated offensesconstitution was set up to prevent thisstormtrooper tactics almost a disgrace when you're almost 800 billion dollars a year down on trade you can't lose a trade war the us has been ripped off by other countries for years on trade time to get smart why is it that the wall street journal though well meaning never mentions the unfairness of the tariffs routinely charged against the us by other countries or the many billions of dollars that the tariffs we are now charging are and will be pouring into us coffers the united states must at long last be treated fairly on trade if we charge a country zero to sell their goods and they charge us 25 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours it is unfair and can no longer be tolerated that is not free or fair trade it is stupid trade there was no collusion with russia except by the democrats when will this very expensive witch hunt hoax ever end so bad for our country is the special counsel/justice department leaking my lawyers letters to the fake news media should be looking at dems corruption instead real  is doing great fake news cnn is dead  very surprised that china would be doing this  now this is a record that will never be broken  $17 million spent it's a scam
