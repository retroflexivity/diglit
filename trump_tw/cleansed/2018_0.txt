the pledge of allegiance and we all proudly stand for the national anthem   after years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation and we are restoring our confidence and our pride   for those of you who are still interested the democrats have totally forgotten about daca not a lot of interest on this subject from them my daughter ivanka just arrived in south korea we cannot have a better or smarter person representing our country cpac today ms-13 gang members are being removed by our great ice and border patrol agents by the thousands but these killers come back in from el salvador and through mexico like water el salvador just takes our money and mexico must help more with this problem we need the wall school shooting survivor says he quit  town hall after refusing scripted question  just like so much of cnn fake news that's why their ratings are so bad msnbc may be worse today it was my great honor to host a school safety roundtable at the  with state and local leaders law enforcement officers and education officialsthere is nothing more important than protecting our children they deserve to be safe and we will deliver  on behalf of an entire nation congratulations to the us women's hockey team on winning the gold    will be meeting with lawmakers today at 11:30 am to discuss school safety  next week it will be with our nation's governors it's been many years of all talk no action we'll get it done what many people don't understand or don't want to understand is that wayne chris and the folks who work so hard at the  are great people and great american patriots they love our country and will do the right thing                  make america great again i will be strongly pushing comprehensive background checks with an emphasis on mental health raise age to 21 and end sale of bump stocks congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue i hope if a potential sicko shooter knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers and others who will be instantly shooting the sicko will never attack that school cowards won't go thereproblem solved must be offensive defense alone won't work history shows that a school shooting lasts on average 3 minutes it takes police  first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime highly trained gun adept teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive great deterrent immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this far more assets at much less cost than guards a gun free school is a magnet for bad people attacks would end i never said give teachers guns like was stated on fake news    what i said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience only the best 20percent of teachers a lot would now be able to i will always remember the time i spent today with courageous students teachers and families so much love in the midst of so much pain we must not let them down we must keep our children safefull listening session    melania and i join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of billy graham our prayers are with his children grandchildren great-grandchildren and all who worked closely with reverend graham in his lifelong ministry  yesterday it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary law enforcement officers and first responders and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers the medal of valor   question if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration right up to january 20th why aren't they the subject of the investigation why didn't obama do something about the meddling why aren't dem crimes under investigation ask jeff sessions the great billy graham is dead there was nobody like him he will be missed by christians and all religions a very special man question if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration right up to january 20th why aren't they the subject of the investigation why didn't obama do something about the meddling why aren't dem crimes under investigation ask jeff session   whether we are republican or democrat we must now focus on strengthening background checks so true thank you  bad ratings    got scammed when they covered the anti-trump russia rally wall-to-wall they probably knew it was fake news but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise main street is booming thanks to our incredible tax cut and reform law this shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic they are ready to grow their businesses  cameras running another false accusation why doesn't  report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me one had her home mortgage paid off only  so reporteddoesn't fit the mainstream media narrative a woman i don't know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the front page of the fake news washington post saying i kissed her for two minutes yet in the lobby of trump tower 12 years ago never happened who would do this in a public space with live security i have been much tougher on russia than obama just look at the facts total fake news hope republicans in the great state of pennsylvania challenge the new pushed congressional map all the way to the supreme court if necessary your original was correct don't let the dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes  waste money matt schlapp and cpac are getting ready for another exciting event big difference from those days when president obama held the white house you've come a long way matt republicans are now leading the generic poll perhaps because of the popular tax cuts which the dems want to take away actually they want to raise you taxes substantially also they want to do nothing on daca r's want to fix the president obama quote just before election that's because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didn't want to rock the boat when i easily won the electoral college the whole game changed and the russian excuse became the narrative of the dems there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig america's elections there's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so i'd invite mr trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes  thank you to  for the great timeline on all of the failures the obama administration had against russia including crimea syria and so much more we are now starting to win again the faith of donald trump a book just out by david brody and scott lamb is a very interesting read enjoy the us economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving the unemployment numbers are looking great and regulations  taxes have been massively cut jobs jobs jobs  has announced he is running for the senate from the wonderful state of utah he will make a great senator and worthy successor to  and has my full support and endorsement obama was president up to and beyond the 2016 election so why didn't he do something about russian meddling have a great but very reflective president's day just watched a very insecure oprah winfrey who at one point i knew very well interview a panel of people on 60 minutes the questions were biased and slanted the facts incorrect hope oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others my great friends from nascar are having their big race today the daytona 500 brian france and the france family are special people enjoy the race thank you to kenstarr former independent counsel whitewater for your insight and powerful words on fisa abuse russian meddling etc really great interview with  great pollster john mclaughlin now has the gop up in the generic congressional ballot big gain over last 4 weeks i guess people are loving the big tax cuts given them by the republicans the cuts the dems want to take away we need more republicans the fake news of big ratings loser cnn  if it was the goal of russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the us then with all of the committee hearings investigations and party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams they are laughing their asses off in moscow get smart america now that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats lead by their fearless leader crooked hillary clinton lost the 2016 election but wasn't i a great candidate i never said russia did not meddle in the election i said it may be russia or china or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer the russian hoax was that the trump campaign colluded with russia it never did finally liddle' adam schiff the leakin' monster of no control is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the 2016 election he is finally right about something obama was president knew of the threat and did nothing thank you adam never gotten over the fact that obama was able to send $17 billion dollars in cash to iran and nobody in congress the fbi or justice called for an investigation general mcmaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the russians and that the only collusion was between russia and crooked h the dnc and the dems remember the dirty dossier uranium speeches emails and the podesta company very sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter this is not acceptable they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign there is no collusion get back to the basics and make us all proud just like they don't want to solve the daca problem why didn't the democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the house  senate during the obama administration because they didn't want to and now they just talk i have seen all of the russian ads and i can say very definitively that swaying the election was *not* the main goalrob goldmanvice president of facebook ads  the fake news media never fails hard to ignore this fact from the vice president of facebook ads rob goldman  funny how the fake news media doesn't want to say that the russian group was formed in 2014 long before my run for president maybe they knew i was going to run even though i didn't know deputy ag rod rosenstein stated at the news conference there is no allegation in the indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election charges deal don a big win written by michael goodwin of the  succinctly states that the russians had no impact on the election results there was no collusion with the trump campaign she lost the old-fashioned way by being a terrible candidate case closed melania and i met such incredible people last night in broward county florida will never forget them or the evening our entire nation w/one heavy heart continues to pray for the victims  their families in parkland fl to teachers law enforcement first responders  medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger we thank you for your courage   russia started their anti-us campaign in 2014 long before i announced that i would run for president the results of the election were not impacted the trump campaign did nothing wrong no collusion cannot believe how badly daca recipients have been treated by the democratstotally abandoned republicans are still working hard i will be leaving for florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth but people whose lives have been totally shattered am also working with congress on many fronts presidential proclamation honoring the victims of the tragedy in parkland florida   lottery continues deadly catch-and-release and bars enforcement even for future illegal immigrants voting for this amendment would be a vote against law enforcement and a vote for open borders if dems are actually serious about daca they should support the grassley bill the schumer-rounds-collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe  says it would be the end of immigration enforcement in america it creates a giant amnesty including for dangerous criminals doesn't build the wall expands chain migration keeps the visa in times of tragedy the bonds that sustain us are those of family faith community and country these bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need   while the republicans and democrats in congress are working hard to come up with a solution to daca they should be strongly considering a system of merit based immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the usa so many signs that the florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem must always report such instances to authorities again and again just spoke to governor rick scott we are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible florida school shooting my prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible florida shooting no child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an american school today i was honored to be joined by republicans and democrats from both the house and senate as well as members of my cabinet to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore america's depleted infrastructure   as we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of african-americans to our nation our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all proclamation   negotiations on daca have begun republicans want to make a deal and democrats say they want to make a deal wouldn't it be great if we could finally after so many years solve the daca puzzle this will be our last chance there will never be another opportunity march 5th our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except of course the democrats after many years we have taken care of our military now we have to fix our roads bridges tunnels airports and more bipartisan make deal dems the journey to  began  2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something i look forward to every year see you at  thank you to sue kruczek who lost her wonderful and talented son nick to the opioid scourge for your kind words while on  we are fighting this terrible epidemic hard nick will not have died in vain this will be a big week for infrastructure after so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the middle east it is now time to start investing in our country just spoke to  to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from  this is a true tragedy rep lou barletta a great republican from pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters will make a fantastic senator he is strong  smart loves pennsylvania  loves our country voted for tax cuts unlike bob casey who listened to tax hikers pelosi and schumer 42 million hard working americans have already received a large bonus and/or pay increase because of our recently passed tax cut  jobs billand it will only get better we are far ahead of schedule so many positive things going on for the usa and the fake news media just doesn't want to go there same negative stories over and over again no wonder the people no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history     my administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe modern and lawful immigration system fully securing the border ending chain migration and canceling the visa lottery congress must secure the immigration system and protect americans  my thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers their families and everybody at the   republicans want to fix daca far more than the democrats do the dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011 and they decided not to do anything about daca they only want to use it as a campaign issue vote republican agencies not just the fbi  doj now the state department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the election comey had conversations with donald trump which i don't believe were accuratehe leaked information corrupt tom fitton of judicial watch on  my view is that not only has trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the dossier and the lies about the clinton/dnc dossier it shows that he's been victimized he's been victimized by the obama administration who were using all sorts of peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation some are true and some are false some are old and some are new there is no recovery for someone falsely accused life and career are gone is there no such thing any longer as due process according to the  a russian sold phony secrets on trump to the us asking price was $10 million brought down to $1 million to be paid over time i hope people are now seeing  understanding what is going on here it is all now starting to come out drain the swamp the democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods and more would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the white house for lack of transparency told them to re-do and send back in proper form jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more republicans in the 2018 election and beyond this bill is a big victory for our military but much waste in order to get dem votes fortunately daca not included in this bill negotiations to start now without more republicans in congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our military sadly we needed some dem votes for passage must elect more republicans in 2018 election just signed bill our military will now be stronger than ever before we love and need our military and gave them everything  and more first time this has happened in a long time also means jobs jobs jobs wow -senator mark warner got caught

leaders working to combat the threat of ms-13 and the reforms we need from congress to defeat it watch here   we need a 21st century merit-based immigration system  chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security  polling shows nearly 7 in 10 americans support an immigration reform package that includes daca fully secures the border ends chain migration  cancels the visa lottery if d's oppose this deal they aren't serious about daca-they just want open borders  my prayers and best wishes are with the family of edwin jackson a

america is once again open for business  representative devin nunes a man of tremendous courage and grit may someday be recognized as a great american hero for what he has exposed and what he has had

daca make a deal little adam schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in washington right up there with comey warner brennan and clapper adam leaves

mornings train collision in south carolina thank you to our incredible first responders for the work they've done a tool of anti-trump political actors this is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to

released friday reports the disturbing fact about how the fbi and fisa appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermaththe fbi failed to inform the fisa court that the clinton campaign had funded the dossierthe fbi became great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages- and nobody even talks about them only russia russia russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is no collusion this memo totally vindicates trump in probe but the russian witch hunt goes on and on their was no collusion and there was no obstruction the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding nothing collusion is dead this is an american disgrace rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49percent a far better number

that has taken place over the last 12 months lowest female unemployment in 18 years democrats are holding our military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration can't let that happen  first for those asking the republicans only have 51 votes in the senate and they need 60 that is why we need to win more republicans in 2018 election we can then be even tougher on  crime and border and even better to our military  veterans this is the one year anniversary of my presidency and the democrats wanted to give me a nice present  democrats are far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border they could have easily made a deal but decided to play shutdown politics instead  in order to power through mess not looking good for our great military or safety  security on the very dangerous southern border dems want a shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the tax cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy excellent preliminary meeting in oval with  working on solutions for security and our great military together with  mcconnell and  making progress four week extension would be best just signed 702 bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection this is not the same fisa law that was so wrongly abused during the election i will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the american people first today i was honored and proud to address the 45th annual  you are living witnesses of this year's march for life theme   shutting down the government is a very serious thing people die accidents happen i don't know how i would vote right now on a cr oksen dianne feinstein d-calif  briefing with director marc short and director mick mulvaney government funding bill past last night in the house of representatives now democrats are needed if it is to pass in the senate but they want illegal immigration and weak borders shutdown

nation that thinks big dreams bigger and always reaches for the stars you are the ones who will shape america's destiny you are the ones who will restore our prosperity and you are the ones who are making america great again   departing pittsburgh now where it was my great honor to stand with our incredible workers and to show the world that america is back and we are coming back bigger and better and stronger than ever before  a government shutdown will be devastating to our militarysomething the dems care very little about chip should be part of a long term solution not a 30 day or short term extension we need the wall for the safety and security of our country we need the wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world if there is no wall there is no deal will be going to pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to rick saccone running for congress in a special election march 13 rick is a great guy we need more republicans to continue our already successful agenda the wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by mexico which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the us the $20 billion dollar wall is peanuts compared to what mexico makes from the us nafta is a bad joke the wall is the wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day i conceived of it parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water isis is in retreat our economy is booming investments and jobs are pouring back into the country and so much more together there is nothing we can't overcome--even a very biased media we are making america great again despite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage there are many great reporters i respect and lots of good news for the american people to be proud of and the fake news winners are main street is back strongest holiday sales bump since the great recession -- beating forecasts by billions of dollars  during the campaign i promised to make america great again by bringing businesses and jobs back to our country i am very proud to see companies like chrysler moving operations from mexico to michigan where there are so many great american workers  i promised that my policies would allow companies like apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the united states great to see apple follow through as a result of tax cuts huge win for american workers and the usa  today we witnessed an incredible moment in history  the presentation of congress' highest civilian honor to our friend and true american hero bob dole   eric trump on   now we need to keep america safe including moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system to one that is merit-based  new report from doj  dhs shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals convicted of terrorism-related charges are foreign-born we have submitted to congress a list of resources and reforms today it was my honor to welcome president nursultan nazarbayev of kazakhstan to the   president donald j trump proclaims january 16 2018 as religious freedom day  unemployment for black americans is the lowest ever recorded trump approval ratings with black americans has doubled thank you and it will get even much better  90percent of trump 2017 news coverage was negative -and much of it contrived do you notice the fake news mainstream media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative the russian collusion hoax is dead except as it pertains to the dems public gets it the democrats want to shut down the government over amnesty for all and border security the biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding military at a time we need it more than ever we need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now no more dangerous lottery we must have security at our very dangerous southern border and we must have a great wall to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country senator dicky durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the daca meeting deals can't get made when there is no trust durbin blew daca and is hurting our military to stop drugs they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do my standard is very simple america first  make america great again statement by me last night in florida honestly i don't think the democrats want to make a deal they talk about daca but they don't want to helpwe are ready willing and able to make a deal but they don't want to they don't want security at the border they don't want big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible among many other things president trump reversed the policies of president obama and reversed our economic decline thank you stuart varney   president trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy tax cut bonuses to more than 2000000 workers most explosive stock market rally that we've seen in modern times 18000 to 26000 from election and grounded in profitability and growth all trump not 0 i as president want people coming into our country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on merit no more lotteries  first daca is probably dead because the democrats don't really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our military and they knew exactly what i said and meant they just wanted a story fake news the wall street journal stated falsely that i said to them i have a good relationship with kim jong un of n korea obviously i didn't say that i said i'd have a good relationship with kim jong un a big difference fortunately we now record conversations with reporters so much fake news is being reported they don't even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong they promote the fake book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information the mainstream media is crazed that we won the election i don't believe the democrats really want to see a deal on daca they are all talk and no action this is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have too bad america first the democrats are all talk and no action they are doing nothing to fix daca great opportunity missed too bad yesterday was a big day for the stock market jobs are coming back to america chrysler is coming back to the usa from mexico and many others will follow tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing american business is hot again yesterday was another big day for jobs and the stock market chrysler coming back to us michigan from mexico and many more companies paying out tax cut money to employees if dems won in november market would have tanked it was headed for disaster today it was my great honor to proclaim january 15 2018 as martin luther king jr federal holiday i encourage all americans to observe this day with appropriate civic community and service activities in honor of dr king's life and legacy  never said anything derogatory about haitians other than haiti is obviously a very poor and troubled country never said take them out made up by dems i have a wonderful relationship with haitians probably should record future meetings unfortunately no trust sadly democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for daca take care of our military and our country first the language used by me at the daca meeting was tough but this was not the language used what was really tough was the outlandish proposal made a big setback for daca because of the democrats not being interested in life and safety daca has now taken a big step backwards the dems will threaten shutdown but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most get smart make america great again countries which are doing badly i want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level i want safety and security for our people i want to stop the massive inflow of drugs i want to fund our military not do a dem defund the so-called bipartisan daca deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of republican senators and congressmen was a big step backwards wall was not properly funded chain  lottery were made worse and usa would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime reason i canceled my trip to london is that i am not a big fan of the obama administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in london for peanuts only to build a new one in an off location for 12 billion dollars bad deal wanted me to cut ribbon-no the democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the southern border risking thousands of lives in the process it is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all americans we must build a great wall think merit and end lottery  chain usa democrat dianne feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal she blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold a first chrysler is moving a massive plant from mexico to michigan reversing a years long opposite trend thank you chrysler a very wise decision the voters in michigan are very happy they voted for trump/pence plenty of more to follow more great news as a result of historical tax cuts and reform

 donald trump is the greatest president our country has ever seen yesterday i signed the  hr 2142 with bipartisan members of congress to help end the flow of drugs into our country together we are committed to doing everything we can to combat the deadly scourge of drug addiction and overdose in the united states  great news as a result of our tax cuts  jobs act  with that being said i have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today's vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land we need it get smart 45 year low in illegal immigration this year  house votes on controversial fisa act today this is the act that may have been used with the help of the discredited and phony dossier to so badly surveil and abuse the trump campaign by the previous administration and others in new quinnipiac poll 66percent of people feel the economy is excellent or good that is the highest number ever recorded by this poll disproven and paid for by democrats dossier used to spy on trump campaign did fbi use intel tool to influence the election   did dems or clinton also pay russians where are hidden and smashed dnc servers where are

want to thank my  for working tirelessly on behalf of our country 2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead together we are delivering results and making america great again   the single greatest witch hunt in american history continues there was no collusion everybody including the dems knows there was no collusion  yet on and on it goes russia  the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing republicans should finally take control the fact that sneaky dianne feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between trump/russia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace must have tough primary it just shows everyone how broken and unfair our court system is when the opposing side in a case such as daca always runs to the 9th circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts  hsi agents and ero officers on behalf of an entire nation thank you for what you are doing 24/7/365 to keep fellow american's safe everyone is so grateful   thank you  kevin mccarthy couldn't agree w/you more together we are ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸  as i

changes trump is bringing are far-reaching  necessary thank you michael goodwin  his is turning out to be an enormously consequential presidency so much so that despite my own frustration over his missteps there has never been a day when i wished hillary clinton were president not one indeed as trump's accomplishments accumulate the mere thought of the stock market has been creating tremendous benefits for our country in the form of not only record setting stock prices but present and future jobs jobs jobs seven trillion dollars of value created since our big election win the fake news awards those going to the most corrupt  biased of the mainstream media will be presented to the losers on wednesday january 17th rather than this coming monday the interest in and importance of these awards is far greater than anyone could have anticipated jake tapper of fake news cnn just got destroyed in his interview with stephen miller of the trump administration watch the hatred and unfairness of this cnn flunky i've had to put up with the fake news from the first day i announced that i would be running for president now i have to put up with a fake book written by a totally discredited author ronald reagan had the same problem and handled it well so will i leaving camp david for the white house great meetings with the cabinet and military on many very important subjects including border security  the desperately needed wall the ever increasing drug and opioid problem infrastructure military budget trade and daca to president of the united states on my first try i think that would qualify as not smart but geniusand a very stable genius at that actually throughout my life my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being like really smart crooked hillary clinton also played these cards very hard and as everyone knows went down in flames i went from very successful businessman to top tv star now that russian collusion after one year of intense study has proven to be a total hoax on the american public the democrats and their lapdogs the fake news mainstream media are taking out the old ronald reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence brian ross the reporter who made a fraudulent live newscast about me that drove the stock market down 350 points billions of dollars was suspended for a month but is now back at abc news in a lower capacity he is no longer allowed to report on trump should have been fired the african american unemployment rate fell to 68percent the lowest rate in 45 years i am so happy about this news and in the washington post of all places headline states trumps first year jobs numbers were very very good michael wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book he used sloppy steve bannon who cried when he got fired and begged for his job now sloppy steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone too bad  good idea rand  the mercer family recently dumped the leaker known as sloppy steve bannon smart well now that collusion with russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with hillary clinton and the fbi/russia the fake news media mainstream and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable they should try winning an election sad dow goes from 18589 on november 9 2016 to 25075 today for a

of the failed experts weighing in does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between north and south korea right now if i wasn't firm strong and willing to commit our total might against the north fools but talks are a good thing as americans you need identification sometimes in a very strong and accurate form for almost everything you doexcept when it comes to the most important thing voting for the people that run your country push hard for voter identification many mostly democrat states refused to hand over data from the 2016 election to the commission on voter fraud they fought hard that the commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally system is rigged must go to voter id make america great again stock market had another good day but now that the tax cut bill has passed we have tremendous upward potential dow just short of 25000 a number that few thought would be possible this soon into my administration also unemployment went down to 41percent only getting better some 40 us companies have responded to president trump's tax cut and reform victory in congress last year by handing out bonuses up to $2000 increases in 401k matches and spending on charity a much higher number than previously known  melania and i are deeply saddened by the death of thomas s monson a beloved president of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints such respect for the people of iran as they try to take back their corrupt government you will see great support from the united states at the

significant first year  showdavid asman  ed rollins i will be announcing the most dishonest  corrupt media awards of the year on monday at 5:00 o'clock subjects will cover dishonesty  bad reporting in various categories from the fake news media stay tuned north korean leader kim jong un just stated that the nuclear button is on his desk at all times will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that i too have a nuclear button but it is a much bigger  more powerful one than his and my button works peace treaty with israel we have taken jerusalem the toughest part of the negotiation off the table but israel for that would have had to pay more but with the palestinians no longer willing to talk peace why should we make any of these massive future payments to them it's not only pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing but also many other countries and others as an example we pay the palestinians hundred of millions of dollars a year and get no appreciation or respect they don't even want to negotiate a long overdue congratulations to senator orrin hatch on an absolutely incredible career he has been a tremendous supporter and i will never forget the beyond kind statements he has made about me as president he is my friend and he will be greatly missed in the us senate  we will not rest until all of america's great veterans can receive

non-existent sources and treat the president of the united states fairly so that the next time i and the people win you won't have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done gl the failing new york times has a new publisher ag sulzberger congratulations here is a last chance for the times to fulfill the vision of its founder adolph ochs to give the news impartially without fear

best and safest year on record sanctions and other pressures are beginning to have a big impact on north korea soldiers are dangerously fleeing to south korea rocket man now wants to talk to south korea for first time perhaps that is good news perhaps not we will see companies are giving big bonuses to their workers because of the tax cut bill really great thank you to brandon judd of the national border patrol council for your kind words on how well we are doing at the border we will be bringing in more  more of your great folks and will build the desperately needed wall  crooked hillary clinton's top aid huma abedin has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols she put classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents remember sailors pictures on submarine jail deep state justice dept must finally act also on comey  others the people of iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt iranian regime all of the money that president obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their pockets the people have little food big inflation and no human rights the us is watching will be leaving florida for washington dc today at 4:00 pm much work to be done but it will be a great new year iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the obama administration the great iranian people have been repressed for many years they are hungry for food  for freedom along with human rights the wealth of iran is being looted time for change the united states has foolishly given pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years and they have given us nothing but lies  deceit thinking of our leaders as fools they give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in afghanistan with little help no more happy new year we are making america great again and much faster than anyone thought possible as our country rapidly grows stronger and smarter i want to wish all of my friends supporters enemies haters and even the very dishonest fake news media a happy and healthy new year 2018 will be a great year for america iran the number one state of sponsored terror with numerous violations of human rights occurring on an hourly basis has now closed down the internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate not good what a year it's been and we're just getting started together we are making america great again happy new year  my deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in douglas county  and their families we love our police and law enforcement god bless them all  why would smart voters want to put democrats in congress in 2018 election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the election people are much better off now not to mention isis va judges strong border 2nd a tax cuts  more if the dems crooked hillary got elected your stocks would be down 50percent from values on election day now they have a great future and just beginning  big protests in iran the people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism looks like they will not take it any longer the usa is watching very closely for human rights violations trump rally stocks put 2017 in the record books  jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the us unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically cut and it will only get better much more to come i use social media not because i like to but because it is the only way to fight a very dishonest and unfair press now often referred to as fake news media phony and non-existent sources are being used more often than ever many stories  reports a pure fiction on taxes this is the biggest corporate rate cut ever going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years agothis is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy every year the obama wh overstated how the economy would grow now real economics and jobs  report oppressive regimes cannot endure forever and the day will come when the iranian people will face a choice the world is watching  the entire world understands that the good people of iran want change and other than the vast military power of the united states that iran's people are what their leaders fear the most  many reports of peaceful protests by iranian citizens fed up with regime's corruption  its squandering of the nation's wealth to fund terrorism abroad iranian govt should respect their people's rights including right to express themselves the world is watching  the democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no daca without the desperately needed wall at the southern border and an end to the horrible chain migration  ridiculous lottery system of immigration etc we must protect our country at all cost why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more while the fake news loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating  just showed that my rating on dec 28 2017 was approximately the same as president obama on dec 28 2009 which was 47percentand this despite massive negative trump coverage  russia hoax in the east it could be the coldest new year's eve on record perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old global warming that our country but not other countries was going to pay trillions of dollars to protect against bundle up together we are making america great again   i've been saying it for a long long time   caught red handed very disappointed that china is allowing oil to go into north korea there will never be a friendly solution to the north korea problem if this continues to happen retail sales are at record numbers we've got the economy going better than anyone ever dreamt and

russia/trump collusion fbi tainted and they used this crooked hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the trump campaign based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular individual mandate has been terminated as part of our tax cut bill which essentially repeals over time obamacare the democrats  republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new healthcare plan i hope everyone is having a great christmas then tomorrow it's back to work in order to make america great again which is happening faster than anyone anticipated merry christmas  merry christmas  people are proud to be saying merry christmas again i am proud to have led the charge against the assault of our cherished and beautiful phrase merry christmas the tax cut/reform bill including massive alaska drilling and the repeal of the highly unpopular individual mandate brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had don't let the fake news convince you otherwiseand our

list at some point and for the good of the country i predict we will start working with the democrats in a bipartisan fashion infrastructure would be a perfect place to start after having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the middle east it is time to start rebuilding our country so true  our big and very popular tax cut and reform bill has taken on an unexpected new source of love that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses this is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of and now it is the rage merry christmas thank you to everyone who joined me at the

fake news media coverage of me is negative with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories hence my use of social media the only way to get the truth out much of mainstream meadia has become a joke

stacked against him congratulations to doug jones on a hard fought victory the write-in votes played a very big factor but a win is a win the people of alabama are great and the republicans will have

military pro life va judges 2nd amendment and more no to jones a pelosi/schumer puppet report anti-trump fbi agent led clinton email probe  now it all starts to make sense people who lost money when the stock market went down 350 points based on the false and dishonest reporting of brian ross of  news he has been suspended should consider hiring a lawyer and suing abc for the damages this bad reporting has caused many millions of dollars after years of comey with the phony and dishonest clinton investigation and more running the fbi its reputation is in tatters worst in history but fear not we will bring it back to greatness tainted no very dishonest fbi agent's role in clinton probe under review led clinton email probe   clinton money going to wife of another fbi agent in charge such a total miscarriage of justice in san francisco  i never asked comey to stop investigating flynn just more fake news covering another comey lie congratulations to  news for suspending brian ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the russia russia russia witch hunt more networks and papers should do the same with their fake news many people in our country are asking what the justice department is going to do about the fact that totally crooked hillary after receiving a subpoena from the united states congress deleted and acid washed 33000 emails no justice so general flynn lies to the fbi and his life is destroyed while crooked hillary clinton on that now famous fbi holiday interrogation with no swearing in and no recording lies many timesand nothing happens to her rigged system or just a double standard great job first lady melania  62 years ago this week a brave seamstress in montgomery alabama uttered one word that changed history  i had to fire general flynn because he lied to the vice president and the fbi he has pled guilty to those lies it is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful there was nothing to hide biggest tax bill and tax cuts in history just passed in the senate now these great republicans will be going for final passage thank you to house and senate republicans for your hard work and commitment we are one step closer to delivering massive tax cuts for working families across america special thanks to  mitch mcconnell and chairman  for shepherding our bill through the senate look forward to signing a final bill before christmas  economists on the tax cuts and jobs act:the enactment of a comprehensive overhaul complete with a lower corporate tax rate will ignite our economy with levels of growth not seen in generations  the media has been speculating that i fired rex tillerson or that he would be leaving soon fake news he's not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects i call the final shots we work well together and america is highly respected again republicans senators are working hard to pass the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country the bill is getting better and better this is a once in a generation chance obstructionist dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit the jury was not told the killer of kate was a 7 time felon the schumer/pelosi democrats are so weak on crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 elections the kate steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected obama border always committing crimes and being violent and yet this info was not used in court his exoneration is a complete travesty of justice build the wall a disgraceful verdict in the kate steinle case no wonder the people of our country are so angry with illegal immigration the christmas story begins 2000 years ago with a mother a father their baby son and the most extraordinary gift of allthe gift of god's love for all of humanitywhatever our beliefs we know that the birth of jesus christ and the story of his life  today is a day that i've been looking very much forward to all year long it is one that you have heard me speak about many times before now as president of the united states it is my tremendous honor to finally wish america and the world a very merry christmas
