Today we honor Billy Graham as only three private citizens before him have been honored We say a prayer for our country that all across this land the Lord will raise up men and women like Billy Graham to spread a message of love and hope to every precious child of God 
Starting at a small Bible School in Florida Billy Graham soon led a nationwide revival From a large tent in Los Angeles to one hundred thousand people in a single day at Yankee Stadium to more than two million people at Madison Square Garden over sixteen weeks in 1957 
Today in the center of this great Chamber lies Billy Graham  an Ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of Godâ€™s grace 
Why is AG Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse Will take forever has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc Isnâ€™t the IG an Obama guy Why not use Justice Department lawyers DISGRACEFUL

WITCH HUNT
Weâ€™ve seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSIONI have seen nothing the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because heâ€™s exercising his power as the President of the US I just donâ€™t see it  Judge Ken Starr
Iâ€™ve been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year I just donâ€™t see the evidencein terms of the collusion itâ€™s all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have  Jonathan Turley on 
Heâ€™s got a very good point Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs Clintonâ€™s criminality at her own hands or through others that ought to be investigated I fully agree with the President on that  on  Show
I will be interviewed by  on  at 9:00 PM Enjoy
Congressman Schiff omitted and distorted key facts   So what else is new He is a total phony
Russians had no compromising information on Donald Trump   Of course not because there is none and never was This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgraceand Obama did nothing about Russia
Dem Memo FBI did not disclose who the clients were the Clinton Campaign and the DNC Wow
The Democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal BUST Just confirms all of the terrible things that were done SO ILLEGAL
BIG CPAC STRAW POLL RESULTS 93percent APPROVE OF THE JOB PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING (Thank you) 50percent say President Trump should Tweet MORE or SAME (funny) 79percent say Republicans in Congress should do a better job of working with President Trump (starting to happen)
Dems are no longer talking DACA Out of sight out of mind they say DACA beneficiaries should not be happy Nancy Pelosi truly doesnâ€™t care about them Republicans stand ready to make a deal
Unemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973 Much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing Regulations
Democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great State of Pennsylvania  This is very unfair to Republicans and to our country as a whole Must be appealed to the United States Supreme Court ASAP
Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them Very smart people Must be firearms adept  have annual training Should get yearly bonus Shootings will not happen again a big  very inexpensive deterrent Up to States
So true Wayne and Lowest black unemployment in history

Today  Melania and I were honored to welcome Prime Minister  and Mrs Turnbull of Australia to the ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ºPress Conference  
Our nationâ€™s motto is IN GOD WE TRUST This week our nation lost an incredible leader who devoted his life to helping us understand what those words really mean We will never forget the historic crowds the voice the energy and the profound faith of Billy Graham  
We salute our great American flag we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of Allegiance and we all PROUDLY STAND for the National Anthem  
After years of rebuilding OTHER nations we are finally rebuilding OUR nation and we are restoring our confidence and our pride  
For those of you who are still interested the Democrats have totally forgotten about DACA Not a lot of interest on this subject from them
My daughter Ivanka just arrived in South Korea We cannot have a better or smarter person representing our country
CPAC Today
MS-13 gang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands but these killers come back in from El Salvador and through Mexico like water El Salvador just takes our money and Mexico must help MORE with this problem We need The Wall
School shooting survivor says he quit  Town Hall after refusing scripted question  Just like so much of CNN Fake News Thatâ€™s why their ratings are so bad MSNBC may be worse
Today it was my great honor to host a School Safety Roundtable at the  with State and local leaders law enforcement officers and education officialsThere is nothing more important than protecting our children They deserve to be safe and we will deliver 
On behalf of an entire Nation CONGRATULATIONS to the US Women's Hockey Team on winning the GOLD   
Will be meeting with Lawmakers today at 11:30 AM to discuss School Safety  Next week it will be with our Nationâ€™s Governors Itâ€™s been many years of all talk no action Weâ€™ll get it done
What many people donâ€™t understand or donâ€™t want to understand is that Wayne Chris and the folks who work so hard at the  are Great People and Great American Patriots They love our Country and will do the right thing                  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue I hope
If a potential sicko shooter knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting the sicko will NEVER attack that school Cowards wonâ€™t go thereproblem solved Must be offensive defense alone wonâ€™t work
History shows that a school shooting lasts on average 3 minutes It takes police  first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime Highly trained gun adept teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive GREAT DETERRENT
immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this Far more assets at much less cost than guards A gun free school is a magnet for bad people ATTACKS WOULD END
I never said give teachers guns like was stated on Fake News    What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience only the best 20percent of teachers a lot would now be able to
I will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students teachers and families So much love in the midst of so much pain We must not let them down We must keep our children safeFull Listening Session  
 Melania and I join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of Billy Graham Our prayers are with his children grandchildren great-grandchildren and all who worked closely with Reverend Graham in his lifelong ministry 
Yesterday it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers the Medal of Valor  
Question If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January 20th why arenâ€™t they the subject of the investigation Why didnâ€™t Obama do something about the meddling Why arenâ€™t Dem crimes under investigation Ask Jeff Sessions
The GREAT Billy Graham is dead There was nobody like him He will be missed by Christians and all religions A very special man
Question If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January 20th why arenâ€™t they the subject of the investigation Why didnâ€™t Obama do something about the meddling Why arenâ€™t Dem crimes under investigation Ask Jeff Session
  Whether we are Republican or Democrat we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks
So true thank you 
Bad ratings    got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall They probably knew it was Fake News but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway Two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise
Main Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law This shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic they are ready to grow their businesses 
cameras running Another False Accusation Why doesnâ€™t  report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me One had her home mortgage paid off Only  so reporteddoesnâ€™t fit the Mainstream Media narrative
A woman I donâ€™t know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago Never happened Who would do this in a public space with live security
I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama just look at the facts Total Fake News
Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new pushed Congressional Map all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary Your Original was correct Donâ€™t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes  waste money
Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House Youâ€™ve come a long way Matt
Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away Actually they want to raise you taxes substantially Also they want to do nothing on DACA Râ€™s want to fix
The President Obama quote just before election Thatâ€™s because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didnâ€™t want to rock the boat When I easily won the Electoral College the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems
There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig Americaâ€™s elections thereâ€™s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so Iâ€™d invite Mr Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes 
Thank you to  for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia including Crimea Syria and so much more We are now starting to win again
The Faith of Donald Trump a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb is a very interesting read Enjoy
The US economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated Companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving The unemployment numbers are looking great and Regulations  Taxes have been massively Cut JOBS JOBS JOBS
 has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to  and has my full support and endorsement
Obama was President up to and beyond the 2016 Election So why didnâ€™t he do something about Russian meddling
Have a great but very reflective Presidentâ€™s Day
Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey who at one point I knew very well interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes The questions were biased and slanted the facts incorrect Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others
My great friends from NASCAR are having their big race today The Daytona 500 Brian France and the France family are special people Enjoy the race
Thank you to KenStarr former Independent Counsel Whitewater for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse Russian meddling etc Really great interview with 
Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot Big gain over last 4 weeks I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans the Cuts the Dems want to take away We need more Republicans
The Fake News of big ratings loser CNN 
If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the US then with all of the Committee Hearings Investigations and Party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams They are laughing their asses off in Moscow Get smart America
Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats lead by their fearless leader Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election But wasnâ€™t I a great candidate
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said it may be Russia or China or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer The Russian hoax was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia it never did
Finally Liddleâ€™ Adam Schiff the leakinâ€™ monster of no control is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election He is finally right about something Obama was President knew of the threat and did nothing Thank you Adam
Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $17 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress the FBI or Justice called for an investigation
General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H the DNC and the Dems Remember the Dirty Dossier Uranium Speeches Emails and the Podesta Company
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter This is not acceptable They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign there is no collusion Get back to the basics and make us all proud
Just like they donâ€™t want to solve the DACA problem why didnâ€™t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House  Senate during the Obama Administration Because they didnâ€™t want to and now they just talk
I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goalRob GoldmanVice President of Facebook Ads 
The Fake News Media never fails Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads Rob Goldman 
Funny how the Fake News Media doesnâ€™t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014 long before my run for President Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didnâ€™t know
Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election
Charges Deal Don A Big Win written by Michael Goodwin of the  succinctly states that the Russians had no impact on the election results There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign She lost the old-fashioned way by being a terrible candidate Case closed
Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County Florida Will never forget them or the evening
Our entire Nation w/one heavy heart continues to pray for the victims  their families in Parkland FL To teachers law enforcement first responders  medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger We THANK YOU for your courage  
Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014 long before I announced that I would run for President The results of the election were not impacted The Trump campaign did nothing wrong no collusion
Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democratstotally abandoned Republicans are still working hard
I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth but people whose lives have been totally shattered Am also working with Congress on many fronts
Presidential Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland Florida  
lottery continues deadly catch-and-release and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement and a vote FOR open borders If Dems are actually serious about DACA they should support the Grassley bill
The Schumer-Rounds-Collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe  says it would be the end of immigration enforcement in America It creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals) doesnâ€™t build the wall expands chain migration keeps the visa
In times of tragedy the bonds that sustain us are those of family faith community and country These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need  
While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA
So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem Must always report such instances to authorities again and again
Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting
My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting No child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school
Today I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate as well as members of my Cabinet to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore Americaâ€™s depleted infrastructure  
As we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of African-Americans to our nation our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all Proclamation  
Negotiations on DACA have begun Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal Wouldnâ€™t it be great if we could finally after so many years solve the DACA puzzle This will be our last chance there will never be another opportunity March 5th
Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except of course the Democrats After many years we have taken care of our Military now we have to fix our roads bridges tunnels airports and more Bipartisan make deal Dems
The journey to  began  2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year See you at

Just spoke to  to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from  This is a true tragedy
Rep Lou Barletta a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters will make a FANTASTIC Senator He is strong  smart loves Pennsylvania  loves our Country Voted for Tax Cuts unlike Bob Casey who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer
42 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut  Jobs Billand it will only get better We are far ahead of schedule
So many positive things going on for the USA and the Fake News Media just doesnâ€™t want to go there Same negative stories over and over again No wonder the People no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history    
My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe modern and lawful immigration system fully securing the border ending chain migration and canceling the visa lottery Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans 
My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers their families and everybody at the  
Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011 and they decided not to do anything about DACA They only want to use it as a campaign issue Vote Republican
agencies not just the FBI  DOJ now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election Comey had conversations with Donald Trump which I donâ€™t believe were accuratehe leaked information (corrupt) Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on 
My view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier it shows that heâ€™s been victimized Heâ€™s been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of
Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation Some are true and some are false Some are old and some are new There is no recovery for someone falsely accused life and career are gone Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process
According to the  a Russian sold phony secrets on Trump to the US Asking price was $10 million brought down to $1 million to be paid over time I hope people are now seeing  understanding what is going on here It is all now starting to come out DRAIN THE SWAMP
The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods (and more) would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency Told them to re-do and send back in proper form
Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low
Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election and beyond This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military but much waste in order to get Dem votes Fortunately DACA not included in this Bill negotiations to start now
Without more Republicans in Congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our Military Sadly we needed some Dem votes for passage Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election
Just signed Bill Our Military will now be stronger than ever before We love and need our Military and gave them everything  and more First time this has happened in a long time Also means JOBS JOBS JOBS
Wow -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch Warner did not want a paper trail on a private meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame All tied into Crooked Hillary
Time to end the visa lottery Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans 
As long as we open our eyes to Godâ€™s grace and open our hearts to Godâ€™s love then America will forever be the land of the free the home of the brave and a light unto all nations  
I will be meeting with Henry Kissinger at 1:45pm Will be discussing North Korea China and the Middle East
Our founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence Our currency declares IN GOD WE TRUST And we place our hands on our hearts as we recite the Pledge of Allegiance and proclaim that we are One Nation Under God  
Will be heading over shortly to make remarks at The National Prayer Breakfast in Washington Great religious and political leaders and many friends including TV producer Mark Burnett of our wonderful 14 season Apprentice triumph will be there Looking forward to seeing all
The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill
Congratulations to the Republic of Korea on what will be a MAGNIFICENT Winter Olympics What the South Korean people have built is truly an inspiration 
Best wishes to the Republic of Korea on hosting the  What a wonderful opportunity to show everyone that you are a truly GREAT NATION

HAPPY BIRTHDAY to our 40th President of the United States of America Ronald Reagan 
Today we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of MS-13 and the reforms we need from Congress to defeat it Watch here  
We need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system  Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security 
Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA fully secures the border ends chain migration  cancels the visa lottery If Dâ€™s oppose this deal they arenâ€™t serious about DACA-they just want open borders 
My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken 
So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed  linebacker Edwin Jackson This is just one of many such preventable tragedies We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border and with illegal immigration FAST
Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law your paychecks are going way UP your taxes are going way DOWN and America is once again OPEN FOR BUSINESS 
Representative Devin Nunes a man of tremendous courage and grit may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure
Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA Make a deal
Little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey Warner Brennan and Clapper Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information Must be stopped
Thank you to  for exposing the truth Perhaps thatâ€™s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition
The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care No thanks

My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work theyâ€™ve done
a tool of anti-Trump political actors This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the lawThe FBI wasnâ€™t straight with Congress as it hid most of these facts from investigators Wall Street Journal
The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermathThe FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossierthe FBI became
Great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages- and nobody even talks about them Only Russia Russia Russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is No Collusion
This memo totally vindicates Trump in probe But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING collusion is dead) This is an American disgrace
Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49percent a far better number than I had in winning the Election and higher than certain sacred cows Other Trump polls are way up also So why does the media refuse to write this Oh well someday
Today it was my honor to join the great men and women of    and  at the US Customs and Border Protection National Targeting Center in Sterling Virginia Fact sheet

You had Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party try to hide the fact that they gave money to GPS Fusion to create a Dossier which was used by their allies in the Obama Administration to convince a Court misleadingly by all accounts to spy on the Trump Team Tom Fitton JW
The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago Rank  File are great people

Democrats are not interested in Border Safety  Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military They are only interested in Obstruction
I have offered DACA a wonderful deal including a doubling in the number of recipients  a twelve year pathway to citizenship for two reasons (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA only use it

Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration Canâ€™t let that happen
 FIRST
For those asking the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate and they need 60 That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election We can then be even tougher on  Crime (and Border) and even better to our Military  Veterans
This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present 
Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead  in order to power through mess
Not looking good for our great Military or Safety  Security on the very dangerous Southern Border Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy
Excellent preliminary meeting in Oval with  working on solutions for Security and our great Military together with  McConnell and  Making progress four week extension would be best

We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world If there is no Wall there is no Deal
Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE running for Congress in a Special Election (March 13) Rick is a great guy We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda
The Wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by Mexico which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the US The $20 billion dollar Wall is peanuts compared to what Mexico makes from the US NAFTA is a bad joke
The Wall is the Wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it Parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water
ISIS is in retreat our economy is booming investments and jobs are pouring back into the country and so much more Together there is nothing we canâ€™t overcome--even a very biased media We ARE Making America Great Again

Unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled Thank you and it will get even (much) better 
90percent of Trump 2017 news coverage was negative -and much of it contrived
Do you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead except as it pertains to the Dems Public gets it
The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military at a time we need it more than ever We need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now No more dangerous Lottery
We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER and we must have a great WALL to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country
Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting Deals canâ€™t get made when there is no trust Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military
to stop drugs they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do My standard is very simple AMERICA FIRST  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Statement by me last night in Florida Honestly I donâ€™t think the Democrats want to make a deal They talk about DACA but they donâ€™t want to helpWe are ready willing and able to make a deal but they donâ€™t want to They donâ€™t want security at the border they donâ€™t want
big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible (among many other things) President Trump reversed the policies of President Obama and reversed our economic decline Thank you Stuart Varney  
President Trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy Tax Cut bonuses to more than 2000000 workers Most explosive Stock Market rally that weâ€™ve seen in modern times 18000 to 26000 from Election and grounded in profitability and growth All Trump not 0
I as President want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on MERIT No more Lotteries  FIRST
DACA is probably dead because the Democrats donâ€™t really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military
and they knew exactly what I said and meant They just wanted a story FAKE NEWS
The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un (of N Korea) Obviously I didnâ€™t say that I said Iâ€™d have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un a big difference Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters
So much Fake News is being reported They donâ€™t even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election
I donâ€™t believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA They are all talk and no action This is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have Too bad
AMERICA FIRST
The Democrats are all talk and no action They are doing nothing to fix DACA Great opportunity missed Too bad

Sadly Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for DACA Take care of our Military and our Country FIRST
The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough but this was not the language used What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made a big setback for DACA
Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety DACA has now taken a big step backwards The Dems will threaten shutdown but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most Get smart MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
countries which are doing badly I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level I want safety and security for our people I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs I want to fund our military not do a Dem defund
The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards Wall was not properly funded Chain  Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime
Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for peanuts only to build a new one in an off location for 12 billion dollars Bad deal Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO

The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues There was no collusion everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion  yet on and on it goes Russia  the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing Republicans should finally take control
The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace Must have tough Primary
It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts

to President of the United States (on my first try) I think that would qualify as not smart but geniusand a very stable genius at that
Actually throughout my life my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being like really smart Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and as everyone knows went down in flames I went from VERY successful businessman to top TV Star

peace treaty with Israel We have taken Jerusalem the toughest part of the negotiation off the table but Israel for that would have had to pay more But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace why should we make any of these massive future payments to them

Wow more than 90percent of Fake News Media coverage of me is negative with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories Hence my use of Social Media the only way to get the truth out Much of Mainstream Meadia has become a joke 
The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily) is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election  I was right Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him
Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory The write-in votes played a very big factor but a win is a win The people of Alabama are great and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time It never ends

Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them) is now in the ring fighting against Trump Very disloyal to Bill  Crooked-USED
Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I donâ€™t know and/or have never met FAKE NEWS
Another false story this time in the Failing  that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day Wrong  Also I seldom if ever watch CNN or MSNBC both of which I consider Fake News I never watch Don Lemon who I once called the dumbest man on television Bad Reporting
Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media They are out of control correct reporting means nothing to them Major lies written then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposeda stain on America
Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill Shaping up even better than projected House and Senate working very hard and smart End result will be not only important but SPECIAL
Things are going really well for our economy a subject the Fake News spends as little time as possible discussing Stock Market hit another RECORD HIGH unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the USA Really good news and much more to come
No American should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country Our cities should be Sanctuaries for Americans  not for criminal aliens

CNNâ€™S slogan is CNN THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS Everyone knows this is not true that this could in fact be a fraud on the American Public There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN Their slogan should be CNN THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS
Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday They were caught red handed just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his mistake) Watch to see if  fires those responsible or was it just gross incompetence

With the great vote on Cutting Taxes this could be a big day for the Stock Market and YOU
Putting Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda of low on taxes tough on crime strong on military and borders so much more Look at your 401-kâ€™s since Election Highest Stock Market EVER Jobs are roaring back
Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama We need his vote on stopping crime illegal immigration Border Wall Military Pro Life VA Judges 2nd Amendment and more No to Jones a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet
Report ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE  Now it all starts to make sense
People who lost money when the Stock Market went down 350 points based on the False and Dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of  News (he has been suspended) should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the damages this bad reporting has caused many millions of dollars
After years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more) running the FBI its reputation is in Tatters worst in History But fear not we will bring it back to greatness
Tainted (no very dishonest) FBI agentâ€™s role in Clinton probe under review Led Clinton Email probe   Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge
Such a total miscarriage of Justice in San Francisco 
I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie
Congratulations to  News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia Russia Russia Witch Hunt More Networks and papers should do the same with their Fake News
Many people in our Country are asking what the Justice Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress deleted and acid washed 33000 Emails No justice
So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed while Crooked Hillary Clinton on that now famous FBI holiday interrogation with no swearing in and no recording lies many timesand nothing happens to her Rigged system or just a double standard
Great job First Lady Melania 
62 years ago this week a brave seamstress in Montgomery Alabama uttered one word that changed history 
I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI He has pled guilty to those lies It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful There was nothing to hide
Biggest Tax Bill and Tax Cuts in history just passed in the Senate Now these great Republicans will be going for final passage Thank you to House and Senate Republicans for your hard work and commitment

Economists on the TAX CUTS and JOBS ACT:The enactment of a comprehensive overhaul complete with a lower corporate tax rate will IGNITE our ECONOMY with levels of GROWTH not SEEN IN GENERATIONS 
The media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon FAKE NEWS Heâ€™s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again
Republicans Senators are working hard to pass the biggest Tax Cuts in the history of our Country The Bill is getting better and better This is a once in a generation chance Obstructionist Dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit
The jury was not told the killer of Kate was a 7 time felon The Schumer/Pelosi Democrats are so weak on Crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 Elections
The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border always committing crimes and being violent and yet this info was not used in court His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice BUILD THE WALL
A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration
The Christmas Story begins 2000 years ago with a mother a father their baby son and the most extraordinary gift of allthe gift of Godâ€™s love for all of humanityWhatever our beliefs we know that the birth of Jesus Christ and the story of his life
