New Reuters Poll just came out and has me at 32percent highest number yetThe silent majority is back and we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
The last thing we need is another Bush in the White House Would be the same old thing (remember read my lips no more taxes) GREATNESS
Jeb Bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body Jeb just can't get it right
Jeb Bush is weak on illegal immigration in favor of common core bad on women's health issues and thinks the Iraq war was a good thing
Now that I started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border most other candidates are finally  speaking up Just politicians

I will be interviewed on  tonight at 8:00 Will be talking about the poor treatment of our veterans illegal immigration etc
Look how small the pages have become  Looks like a tabloidsaving money I assume
This story is no longer about John McCain it’s about our horribly treated vets Illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans
It was only after I informed NBC that I wouldn't do the Apprentice that they became upset w/ me They couldn’t care less about inclusion
   At least we're talking about the  We weren't a month ago  
We will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans
The ever dwindling  which is worth about 1/10 of what it was purchased for is always hitting me politically Who cares
My  piece Trump I don't need to be lectured
I will be making some very big campaign stops next week big crowds and tremendous  energy  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
The Republican Party must get tougher and smarter and fast or it will go down to a very big defeat just like the last two times
A true piece about the standing ovations I got yesterday
The Veterans Administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly John McCain has done nothing to help them but talk
John McCain called thousands of people crazies when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in Phoenix He owes apology
Wow   just wrote the definitive piece on what I said about John McCain 
One of the reasons I am no fan of John McCain is that our Vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians I will fix VA quickly
Via  Donald Trump John McCain Is ‘A Loser’
Why would anybody listen to  He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama By the wayso did John McCain
Congrats to the new Gov of Texas  for taking a tough  bold stance at the border Should have been done long ago by Perry
I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans Veterans deserve universal access to care VA scandal proves politicians are inept
that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care
It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans
I will make this right for our great Vets
All he does is go on television is talk talk talk but incapable of doing anything
John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives
The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years
Captured or not all our soldiers are heroes
In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President
Just left Family Leadership Summit in Iowa got a standing ovation from many wonderful people I will be back soon

El Chapo comes to the US often thru our borderit's been revealed he has CA drivers license
Mexico’s totally corrupt gov’t looks horrible with El Chapo’s escapetotally corrupt US paid them $3 billion
The joke around town is that I freed El Chapo from the Mexican prison because the timing was so good w/ my statements on border security
 Greatly appreciate yr wonderful comments this weekend People of great accomplishment should easily quality for prez
Isn’t it interesting that now that I’m  in the polls the networks show polls that are a month old
When will people and the media start to apologize to me for my statement Mexico is sending which turned out to be true  El Chapo
likewise billions of dollars gets brought into Mexico    through the border We get the killers drugs  crime they get the money
El Chapo and the Mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a  vacuum cleaner sucking drugs and death right into the US
The US will invite El Chapo the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison to become a US citizen because our leaders can't say no
but that's what I've been saying Very unfair treatment by the media
Now that the Mexican drug lord escaped from prison everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc coming into the US comes over border
I hear that sleepy eyes  will be fired like a dog from ratings starved Meet The Press I can't imagine what is taking so long
Trump however would kick his ass
Can you envision Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton negotiating with 'El Chapo' the Mexican drug lord who escaped from prison 
Sleep eyes  is killing Meet The Press Isn't he pathetic Love watching him fail
