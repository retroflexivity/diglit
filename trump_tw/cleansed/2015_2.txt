talking about the  we weren't a month ago   we will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans the ever dwindling  which

crowds and tremendous  energy  make america great again the republican party must get tougher and smarter and fast or it will go down to a very big defeat just like the last two times a true piece about the standing ovations i got yesterday the veterans administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly john mccain has done nothing to help them but talk john mccain called thousands of people crazies when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in phoenix he owes apology wow   just wrote the definitive piece on what i said about john mccain  one of the reasons i am no fan of john mccain is that our vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians i will fix va quickly via  donald trump john mccain is ‘a loser' why would anybody listen to  he lost an election that should have easily been won against obama by the wayso did john mccain congrats to the new gov of texas  for taking a tough  bold stance at the border should have been done long ago by perry i have a proven track record supporting our veterans veterans deserve universal access to care va scandal proves politicians are inept that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care it's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our veterans i will make this right for our great vets all he does is go on television is talk talk talk but incapable of doing anything john mccain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for veterans to successfully manage their lives the veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years captured or not all our soldiers are heroes in addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our vets john mccain let us down by losing to barack obama in his run for president just left family leadership summit in iowa got a standing ovation from many wonderful people i will be back soon
