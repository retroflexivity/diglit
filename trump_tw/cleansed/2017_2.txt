the republican senators concerning healthcare they really want to get it right unlike ocare with zero democrats to help and a failed expensive and dangerous obamacare as the dems legacy the republican senators are working hard so they caught fake news cnn cold but what about nbc cbs  abc what about the failing    they are all fake news fake news cnn is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony russian stories ratings way down wow cnn had to retract big story on russia with 3 employees forced to resign what about all the other phony stories they do fake news great day for america's future security and safety courtesy of the us supreme court i will keep fighting for the american people  win from  bombshell in 2016 obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an american election  check out his statement witch hunt very grateful for the 9-o decision from the u s supreme court we must keep america safe republican senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the democrats not easy perhaps just let ocare crash  burn under a magnifying glass they have zero tapes of t people colluding there is no collusion  no obstruction i should be given apology the real story is that president obama did nothing after being informed in august about russian meddling with 4 months looking at russia and did not want to rock the boat he didn't choke he colluded or obstructed and it did the dems and crooked hillary no good the reason that president obama did nothing about russia after being notified by the cia of meddling is that he expected clinton would win the democrats have become nothing but obstructionists they have no policies or ideas all they do is delay and complainthey own obamacare i am on  enjoy hillary clinton colluded with the democratic party in order to beat crazy bernie sanders is she allowed to so collude unfair to bernie make america great again i cannot imagine that these very fine republican senators would allow the american people to suffer a broken obamacare any longer obama administration official said they choked when it came to acting on russian meddling of election they didn't want to hurt hillary since the obama administration was told way before the 2016 election that the russians were meddling why no action focus on them not t democrats slam gop healthcare proposal as obamacare premiums  deductibles increase by over 100percent remember keep your doctor keep your plan just out the obama administration knew far in advance of november 8th about election meddling by russia did nothing about it why weekly addressüá∫üá∏  today it was a tremendous honor for me to sign the  act into law delivering my campaign promise  i've helped pass and signed 38 legislative bills mostly with no

i did not make and do not have any such recordings with all of the recently reported electronic surveillance intercepts unmasking and illegal leaking of information i have no idea i certainly hope the democrats do not force nancy p out that would be very bad for the republican party and please let cryin' chuck stay why did the dnc refuse to turn over its server to the fbi and still hasn't it's all a big dem scam and excuse for losing the election why did democratic national committee turn down the dhs offer to protect against hacks long prior to election it's all a big dem hoax by the way if russia was working so hard on the 2016 election it all took place during the obama admin why didn't they stop them former homeland security advisor jeh johnson is latest top intelligence official to

the courts can call it whatever they want but i am calling it what we need and what it is a travel ban do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now that's because they used knives and a truck at least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and mayor of london says there is no reason to be alarmed we must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people if we don't get smart it will only get worse whatever the united states can do to help out in london and the u k we will be there we are with you god bless we need to be smart vigilant and
