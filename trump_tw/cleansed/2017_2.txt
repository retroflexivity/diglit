Can you believe that Mitch McConnell who has screamed Repeal  Replace for 7 years couldn't get it done Must Repeal  Replace ObamaCare

Senator Mitch McConnell said I had excessive expectations but I don't think so After 7 years of hearing Repeal  Replace why not done
Hopefully we will never have to use this power but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world
My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before
Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama He has my complete and total endorsement

I will be holding a major briefing on the Opioid crisis a major problem for our country today at 3:00 PM in Bedminster NJ
I think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam where he lied about his service so he can at least say he was there
How much longer will the failing nytimes with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources) remain in business
The Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Council's 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N Korea
On üíúI thank all the brave men and women who have sacrificed in battle for this GREAT NATION üá∫üá∏ 
conquests how brave he was and it was all a lie He cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child Now he judges collusion
Never in UShistory has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal He told stories about his Vietnam battles and
Interesting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a  phony Vietnam con artist
Working hard from New Jersey while White House goes through long planned renovation Going to New York next week for more meetings
Hard to believe that with 24/7  News on CNN ABC NBC CBS NYTIMES  WAPO the Trump base is getting stronger
 Supreme Court pick economic enthusiasm deregulation  so much more have driven the Trump base even closer together Will never change
and West Virginia The fact is the Fake News Russian collusion story record Stock Market border security military strength jobs
The Trump base is far bigger   stronger than ever before (despite some phony Fake News polling) Look at rallies in Penn Iowa Ohio
The failing  which has made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win (apologized) is totally inept

Business is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels Stock Market at an all-time high That doesn't just happen
I love the White House one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen But Fake News said I called it a dump TOTALLY UNTRUE
I campaigned on creating a merit-based immigration system that protects US workers  taxpayers Watch   
Why the Rust Belt just gave Donald Trump a hero's welcome
It was my great honor to pay tribute to a VET who went above  beyond the call of duty to PROTECT our COMRADES our COUNTRY  OUR FREEDOM 
Small business owners are the DREAMERS  INNOVATORS who are powering us into the futureRead more and watch here

Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now Thank you Stuart Varney  Jobs are starting to roarwatch
Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22000 today Was 18000 only 6 months ago on Election Day Mainstream media seldom mentions
A great day at the White House
Highest Stock Market EVER best economic numbers in years unemployment lowest in 17 years wages raising border secure SC No WH chaos
If ObamaCare is hurting people  it is why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies  why should Congress not be paying what public pays
Don't give up Republican Senators the World is watching Repeal  Replaceand go to 51 votes (nuke option) get Cross State Lines  more
they do NOTHING for us with North Korea just talk We will no longer allow this to continue China could easily solve this problem
I am very disappointed in China Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade yet
I love reading about all of the geniuses who were so instrumental in my election success Problem is most don't exist  News MAGA
Unless the Republican Senators are total quitters Repeal  Replace is not dead Demand another vote before voting on any other bill
US Stock Market up almost 20percent since Election
If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon
After seven years of talking Repeal  Replace the people of our great country are still being forced to live with imploding ObamaCare
If the Senate Democrats ever got the chance they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute They are laughing at R's MAKE CHANGE
8 Dems totally control the US Senate Many great Republican bills will never pass like Kate's Law and complete Healthcare Get smart
Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW They look like fools and are just wasting time
The very outdated filibuster rule must go Budget reconciliation is killing R's in Senate Mitch M go to 51 Votes NOW and WIN IT'S TIME
Republican Senate must get rid of 60 vote NOW It is killing the R Party allows 8 Dems to control country 200 Bills sit in Senate A JOKE
In other words Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election and why not I want strong military  low oil prices Witch Hunt 
We will defend our country protect our communities and put the safety of the AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST Replay

Departing for Long Island now An area under siege from  gang members We will not rest until  is eradicated  
We will always ENFORCE our laws PROTECT our borders and SUPPORT our police  Pennsylvania   
Even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51 some really good things need 60 So many great future bills  budgets need 60 votes
If Republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the Senate they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority not senseless 60
3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down As I said from the beginning let ObamaCare implode then deal Watch
Go Republican Senators Go Get there after waiting for 7 years Give America great healthcare
It was my great HONOR to present our nation's highest award for a public safety officer THE MEDAL OF VALOR to FIVE AMERICAN HEROES

about then candidate Trump Catherine Herridge  So why doesn't Fake News report this Witch Hunt Purposely phony reporting

ObamaCare is torturing the American PeopleThe Democrats have fooled the people long enough Repeal or Repeal  Replace I have pen in hand
Big day for HealthCare After 7 years of talking we will soon see whether or not Republicans are willing to step up to the plate
Problem is that the acting head of the FBI  the person in charge of the Hillary investigation Andrew McCabe got $700000 from H for wife
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails  DNC server)  Intel leakers
Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign quietly working to boost Clinton So where is the investigation AG 
Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly
So many stories about me in the  are Fake News They are as bad as ratings challenged  Lobbyist for Amazon and taxes
The Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive dangerous and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad
 Remember your duty Honor your history Take care of the people God puts into your life  and LOVE  CHERISH your country 
Any senator who votes against starting debate is telling America that you are fine w/ the  Remarks  
Arriving at Joint Base Andrews with   and  
Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal  Replace after years of talking  campaigning on it
Sleazy Adam Schiff the totally biased Congressman looking into Russia spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse
So why aren't the Committees and investigators and of course our beleaguered AG looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes  Russia relations
After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found Chuck Schumer just stated that Democrats should blame ourselvesnot Russia
Drain the Swamp should be changed to Drain the Sewer it's actually much worse than anyone ever thought and it begins with the Fake News
Thank you to  for giving the first six months of the Trump Administration an A+ SCreg cuttingStock M jobsborder etc = TRUE
If Republicans don't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand
It's hard to read the Failing New York Times or the Amazon Washington Post because every story/opinion even if should be positive is bad
It's very sad that Republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their President
As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold Democrats and Russians

ObamaCare is dead and the Democrats are obstructionists no ideas or votes only obstruction It is solely up to the 52 Republican Senators
The Republican Senators must step up to the plate and after 7 years vote to Repeal and Replace Next Tax Reform and Infrastructure WIN
In all fairness to Anthony Scaramucci he wanted to endorse me 1st before the Republican Primaries started but didn't think I was running
My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media  authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted ( acid washed) her 33000 e-mails
What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia including Podesta Company Uranium deal Russian Reset big dollar speeches etc
So many people are asking why isn't the AG or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes 33000 e-mails deleted
While all agree the U S President has the complete power to pardon why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against usFAKE NEWS

The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is  it will get even better at lunchtimeThe Dems scream death as OCare dies
I will be having lunch at the White House today with Republican Senators concerning healthcare They MUST keep their promise to America
The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister
Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is sick All G 20 leaders and spouses were invited by the Chancellor of Germany Press knew
The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes Even parts of full Repeal need 60 8 Dems control Senate Crazy
With only a very small majority the Republicans in the House  Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct no votes
As I have always said let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan Stay tuned
We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans Most Republicans were loyal terrific  worked really hard We will return
Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now  work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate Dems will join in

I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare They really want to get it right unlike OCare
With ZERO Democrats to help and a failed expensive and dangerous ObamaCare as the Dems legacy the Republican Senators are working hard
So they caught Fake News CNN cold but what about NBC CBS  ABC What about the failing    They are all Fake News
Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories Ratings way down

Republican Senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the Democrats Not easy Perhaps just let OCare crash  burn
under a magnifying glass they have zero tapes of T people colluding There is no collusion  no obstruction I should be given apology
The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling With 4 months looking at Russia
and did not want to rock the boat He didn't choke he colluded or obstructed and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win
The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS they have no policies or ideas All they do is delay and complainThey own ObamaCare
I am on  Enjoy
Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders Is she allowed to so collude Unfair to Bernie

Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI and still hasn't It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election

Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his no reason to be alarmed statement MSM is working hard to sell it
  Dems are taking forever to approve my people including Ambassadors They are nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS Want approvals
In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the US in order to help keep our country safe The courts are slow and political
The Justice Dept should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court  seek much tougher version
The Justice Dept should have stayed with the original Travel Ban not the watered down politically correct version they submitted to SC
People the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want but I am calling it what we need and what it is a TRAVEL BAN
Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now That's because they used knives and a truck
At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is no reason to be alarmed
We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people If we don't get smart it will only get worse
Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U K we will be there WE ARE WITH YOU GOD BLESS
We need to be smart vigilant and tough We need the courts to give us back our rights We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety
