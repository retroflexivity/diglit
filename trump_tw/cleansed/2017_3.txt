the sky jones would be a disaster wow even i didn't realize we did so much wish the fake news would report thank you   is much more important in the united states than cnn but outside of the us cnn

league lavar you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during thanksgiving with your son in china but no nba contract to support you but remember lavar shoplifting is not a little thing it's a really big deal especially in china ungrateful fool it wasn't the white house it wasn't the state department it wasn't father lavar's so-called people on the ground in china that got his son out of a long term prison sentence it was me too bad lavar is just a poor man's version of don king but without the hair just think today we continued a wonderful american tradition at the white house

his son out during my next trip to china instead china told them why they were released very ungrateful sen jeff flakey who is unelectable in the great state of arizona quit race anemic polls was caught purposely on mike saying bad things about your favorite president he'll be a no on tax cuts because his political career anyway is toast now that the three basketball players are out of china and saved from years in jail lavar ball the father of liangelo is unaccepting of what i did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal i should have left them in jail crooked hillary clinton is
