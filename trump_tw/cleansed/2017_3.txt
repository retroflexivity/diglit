LaVar you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China but no NBA contract to support you But remember LaVar shoplifting is NOT a little thing It’s a really big deal especially in China Ungrateful fool
It wasn’t the White House it wasn’t the State Department it wasn’t father LaVar’s so-called people on the ground in China that got his son out of a long term prison sentence IT WAS ME Too bad LaVar is just a poor man’s version of Don King but without the hair Just think

Shoplifting is a very big deal in China as it should be (5-10 years in jail) but not to father LaVar Should have gotten his son out during my next trip to China instead China told them why they were released Very ungrateful
Sen Jeff Flake(y) who is unelectable in the Great State of Arizona (quit race anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on mike saying bad things about your favorite President He’ll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is toast
Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail LaVar Ball the father of LiAngelo is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal I should have left them in jail
Crooked Hillary Clinton is the worst (and biggest) loser of all time She just can’t stop which is so good for the Republican Party Hillary get on with your life and give it another try in three years
Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts Under study for years Will update soon with Secretary Zinke Thank you
