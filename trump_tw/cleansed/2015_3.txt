negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  he's almost last i loved beating john kasich in the debates but it was easyhe came in dead last kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in new hampshire and his numbers have gone down people from nh are smart watch kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads i will sue him just for fun i want to do negative ads on john kasich but he is so irrelevant to the race that i don't want to waste my money john kasich despite being governor of ohio is losing to me in the ohio polls pathetic john kasich should focus

admits his friend named bob who he tried to stab bob was saved by his belt buckle no longer exists as bob wrong name with ben carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer stab a friend and pyramids built for grain storage don't people get it such bad reporting a puff piece on ben carson in the  states that carson is trying to solidify his lead but i am  easily sad florida ethics commission advocate comes down hard on rubio so do two people who worked with him said he used the wrong credit card sure a great honor to easily finish first in the  poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner the carson story is either a total fabrication or if true even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend rubio lied about my meeting w/ hispanic activists i didn't change my opinion but treated them w/ respect shame   should have corrected jeb bush when he said that i ran for president twice never ran merely considered running jeb bush just said about marco rubio he's my friend pure political speak why can't he be truthful and say disloyal guy no friend also tune in to the  at 7:00am i will be on to

trump join me tuesday nov 3rd at 12 pm in  in nyc i'll be signing copies of my book crippled america don't miss it if jeb bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with marco in the debate bad facts for marco if properly delivered marco rubio will not win weak on illegal immigration strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a lightweight i told you in speeches months ago that jeb and marco do not like each other marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to jeb as his mentor jeb's new slogan jeb can fix it i never thought of jeb as a crook stupid message the word fix is not a good one to use in politics anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for marco rubio  read this  further proof that gang of eight member marco rubio is weak on illegal immigration is paul singer's mr amnesty endorsementrubs can't win gov john kasich has really failed on the campaign trail i thought he would have been far more talented he is just wasting time  money   john oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show i said no thanks waste of time  energy few people know that   is still in business tell your writer  alisa soloman that i left the apprentice to run for president no complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if i

highly respected new national poll that just came out via the economist 32percent  does anybody think that  will get their fictitious  polling numbers corrected sometime prior to the start of the debate sad  can you believe kasie hunt's poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in iowa  is a scam  continues to report fictious poll numbers number one based on every statistic is trump by a wide margin they just can't say it after a great evening and packed auditorium in iowa i am now in colorado looking forward to what i am sure will be a very unfair debate thank

keeping ford in us who cares my supporters know the truth think what can be done as president word is that ford motor because of my constant badgering at packed events is going to cancel their deal to go to mexico and stay in us   great numbers from  poll also from abc-washington post poll thank you   do you believe that  is still playing up the old iowa poll numbers and no mention of the abcwashington post or just out cbs results  poll wow  new hampshire  trump 38percent carson 12percent bush 8percent  south carolina trump 40percent carson 23percent cruz 8percent iowa trump 27percent

what i do i spell out some of the differences between ben carson and myself at 9:00 am on   ben is very weak on illegal immigration a big poll will be announced this morning on   face the nation i wonder if i do well if the press will report the results doubt it this is just not the right time for jeb bush his campaign is in total disarray too much staff being paid way too much money = us govt i will be doing a major sit down interview on state of the union with jake tapper at 9:00 am on  enjoy while jeb bush is cutting staff and salaries after having paid ridiculous amounts of money why did he pay so much in the first place  is slashing campaign salaries people making millions if he can't manage his campaign how can he manage our countries finances  had a tiny 300 person crowd at senator tim scott's forum i had thousands and they had real passion   is totally lost -- he spends too much time managing the bloated staff of his campaign  not enough talking about america's future

said no way every poll has me winning bigif you listen to dopey karl rove a trump hater on  you would think i'm doing poorly  why does  and  always have karl rove on he spent $430 million and lost all races a dope who said romney won election i'm turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributionsfeel totally stupid doing so but hope it is appreciated by the voters many super pacs funded by groups that want total control over their candidate are being formed to attack trump remember when u see them no more clintons or bushes  congrats everyone--we topped 4 million today on twitter--and heading up fast while millions are being spent against me in attack ads they are paid for by the bosses and owners of candidates i am self funding jeb is spending millions of dollars on hit ads funded by lobbyists  special interests bad system yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign will jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me the just released public policy polling ppp national result is the best yet make america great again just out new ppp national poll has me in first place by a wide margin at 29percent i wonder why only  has not reported this
