The dopes at the  bought the Boston Globe for $13 billion and sold it for $100 Their great old headquarters-gave it away So dumb
The  is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control With unfunded liabilities-big trouble
The failing  should be focused on good reporting and the papers financial survival and not with constant hits on Donald Trump

Going to Columbus Ohio today for a tremendous rally of thousands The silent majority is no longer silent

Going to South Carolina now great place SRO crowd Iowa was amazing yesterday
The media must denigrate ISIS at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it These are low level degenerates NOT masterminds
The media must immediately stop calling ISIS leaders MASTERMINDS Call them instead thugs and losers Young people must not go into ISIS
A wonderful afternoon in Iowa Great people Heading now to Florida tomorrow South Carolina  
A great evening in Iowa Thank you Des Moines Area Community College for a great forum   
John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed bringing down the world and ruining people's lives A total failure
Once John Kasich announced he was running for president and opened his mouth people realized he was a complete  total dud
John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare and the people of Ohio are suffering for it Shame
Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  he’s almost last
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates but it was easyhe came in dead last
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down People from NH are smart
Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money
John Kasich despite being Governor of Ohio is losing to me in the Ohio polls Pathetic
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image not negative ads on me
Governor Kasich whose failed campaign  debating skills have brought him way down in the polls is going to spend $25 million against me

Melania and I just had interview with the legendary  Watch  this Friday Tonight we talk ISIS

One of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great  They have lost their way and are no longer credible
What is our President doing 
GOP Voters Trust Donald Trump to Keep Our Country Safe 
Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country Who knows who they are some could be ISIS Is our president insane
I along with almost everyone else have so little confidence in President Obama He has a horrible attitude-a man who is resigned to defeat

Remember I was the one who said attack the oil (ISIS source of wealth) a long time ago Everyone scoffed now they're attacking the oil
Tom Brady just did it again He is not only a great guy he is without question the BEST quarterback
President Obama just told President Putin how important the Russian air strikes against ISIS have been I TOLD YOU SO
    John focus on running your company I think the service is terrible Try hiring some good managers
Glad to see that  lost her championship fight last night Was soundly beaten not a nice person
I have watched sloppy Graydon Carter fail and close Spy Magazine and now am watching him fail at  Magazine He is a total loser
 Magazine is doing really poorly It has gotten worse and worse over the years and has lost almost all of it's former allure
We need strong tough and brilliant leadership now more than ever  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
I had a great time in Texas yesterday A tremendous crowd of wonderful and enthusiastic people Will be back soon
 on ISISOIL FIELDS Saying it for years  you should acknowledge this  
When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM He  can't say it and unless he will  the problem will not be solved
I think everyone will like my new and very successful book Crippled America Go get it and let me know what you think
Wow Bernie Sanders just admitted that the real unemployment rate is 10percent (it is actually over 20percent) and for  African American youth 51percent
Hillary and Sanders are not doing well but what is the failed former Mayor of Baltimore doing on that stage O'Malley is a clown
Why won't President Obama use the term Islamic Terrorism Isn't it now after all of this time and so much death about time
Great news out of New Hampshire DonaldTrump is pulling away from the pack w/ 2nd is 17percent behind him  
We need much tougher much smarter leadership and we need it NOW
President Obama said ISIL continues to shrink in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris He is just so bad CHANGE
My prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible Paris attacks May God be with you all
Boy is this guy  tough on me So totally biased As a reporter he should be ashamed of himself 
They laughed at me when I said to bomb the ISIS controlled oil fields Now they are not laughing and doing what I said 
Thank you  for giving me credit for my vision on bombing the oil fields Should have been done long ago 
Great honor to be inducted into the NJ Boxing Hall of Fame last night Thank you Timing could not have been better 
  Carly whose campaign is dead is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope Sad
 had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning Ben Carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign
 I only said I was on  four weeks ago with Putinnever said I was in Green Room Separate piecesgreat ratings
  Ben Carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper  pathological disease I didn’t say it he did Apology
 CarlyI did graduate from Wharton and did very well Who is your fact checker Will you apologize
 Carly not just you I also told Gov Kasich to let Jeb talk give him a chance because Kasich was constantly cutting in
Happy Friday the 13th

Thank you  for showing the  was wrong So dishonest 
From 2percent to 27percent in Texas quite a jump into first place
Wow pres candidate Ben Carson who is very weak on illegal Immigration just said  he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship
Total fool  is part of the Republican Establishment problem An all talk no action dummy   
 and dopey Karl Rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible TPP deal
Why does the failing  write a false editorial about me and let dummy  make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper
 is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP This moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100percent
We as a country either have borders or we don't IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY
Why wouldn't the  call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong No wonder it is doing poorly
When and how are the dummies at the  going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me I want smart trade deals
The  Editorial Board is so wrong so often They got info from an incorrect story in another pub Why not watch and listen to debate
 Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and TPP and apologize China not part but will get their way in later
Today's  Editorial is WRONG again I know that China is not in the new TPP trade deal but would come in latter through a back door
I will be interviewed on   at 7:30
All seven on-line polls including Drudge and Time with thousands of respondents said I won the debate  said I was so so

Marco Rubio is totally weak on illegal immigration  in favor of easy amnesty A lightweight choker bad for 
Marco Rubio couldn't even respond properly to President Obama's State of the Union Speech without pouring sweat  chugging water He choked
Marco Rubio is a total lightweight who I wouldn’t hire to run one of my smaller companies a highly overrated politician
A great evening in Springfield Illinois Thank you for all of the support  
Great job on   Nobody could have done it better
Thanks Piers Greatly appreciated

Saturday Night Live has some incredible things in store tonight The great thing about playing myself is that it will be authentic Enjoy
 Please thank your brother for his nice words on television Seems like a great guy and character 
One of the dumbest political pundits on television is Chris Stirewalt of  Wrong facts check Fox debate rankings Trump  Dope
Would be nice if  learned how to read the polls before writing his next story Probably done on purpose but not good reporting
 has become a sad case His magazine is failing badly probably doesn't have long to go and his predictions are always wrong
Will be on  tonight Signing a copy of Crippled America for Bill 
So sad that Obama rejected Keystone Pipeline Thousands of jobs good for the environment no downside
Happy Birthday to the great  He's done so many wonderful things not the least of which is his fantastic family I love Billy
Getting ready for  commercial 
 Thank you so much for the nice words and support--really enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts
I think it would be a good ideaand fairto include    in the debate Both solid  good guys 
Carson now admits his friend named Bob who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle) no longer exists as Bob Wrong name
With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage don't people get it
Such bad reporting A puff piece on Ben Carson in the  states that Carson is trying to solidify his lead But I am  easily Sad
Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio So do two people who worked with him Said he used the wrong credit card Sure
A great honor to easily finish FIRST in the  poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner
The Carson story is either a total fabrication or if true even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend
Rubio lied about my meeting w/ Hispanic activists I didn’t change my opinion but treated them w/ respect Shame 
 should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I ran for president twice Never ran merely considered running
Jeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio he's my friend Pure political speak Why can't he be truthful and say disloyal guy no friend
Also tune in to the  at 7:00am I will be on to discuss the campaign my new ads and 
I will unveil my first campaign ads on  at 6:30am tomorrow Enjoy 
Wow  poll just came out  with 26percent Almost as importantly I am the strongest on economic issues by far

Isn't it terrible that  used a poll not used before (IBD) when I was down but refuses to use it now when I am up
  
I will be on  tonight at 10pmE talking about my new book  and much more  
Marco Rubio would keep Barack Obama’s executive order on amnesty intact See article Cannot be President      
 is looking for a new puppet after Governor Walker and Jeb Bush cratered He now likes Rubio--next fail

While in politics it is often smart to send out false messages one thing is clear  That Hillary does not want to run against TRUMP
Join me Tuesday Nov 3rd at 12 PM in  in NYC I'll be signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA Don't miss it
If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered
Marco Rubio will not win Weak on illegal immigration strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a lightweight
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor
Jeb's new slogan Jeb can fix it I never thought of Jeb as a crook Stupid message the word fix is not a good one to use in politics
Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS 
Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's Mr Amnesty endorsementRubs can't win
Gov John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail I thought he would have been far more talented He is just wasting time  money
  John Oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show I said NO THANKS Waste of time  energy
Few people know that   is still in business Tell your writer  Alisa Soloman that I left The Apprentice to run for president
No complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if I wasn't in them Interesting question
Thank you James Freeman of the  for the very nice words All polls said I won the debate except NBC (3rd) Explain to Daniel Henninger
 
Support Coach Kennedy and his right together with his young players to pray on the football field Liberty Institute just suspended him
Just left Virginia where I unveiled my healthcare and other plans for our great Veterans They will be very happy 
 said such nice things about me during the debate that I thought I'd do his show  on Monday (2:30pm EST)
The  Wall Street Journal loves to write badly about me They better be careful or I will unleash big time on them Look forward to it
Lifting off right now for USS Wisconsin in Norfolk See ya'
I told you so- just lost it's top person Poor results and no money to pay him If they were legit they would be doing far better
I am leaving for Norfolk Virginia the great battleship USS Wisconsin for a big rally and really big crowd See you soon
I see Marco Rubio just landed another billionaire to give big money to his Superpac which are total scams Marco must address him as SIR
The new NBC POLL has me in first place but said I was third in the debate I demand a recount (just kidding) EVERY other poll had me 
Black Lives Matter protesters totally disrupt Hillary Clinton event She looked lost This is not what we need with ISIS CHINA RUSSIA etc
I am going to save Medicare and Medicaid Carson wants to abolish and failing candidate Gov John Kasich doesn't have a clue weak

  POLL  TOTAL TRUMP 2522  CARSON 1978  RUBIO 967
 Poll one of the most highly respected was just released Wow wait until the media digests these numbers won't be happy
I'm sure the media will not report the highly respected new national poll that just came out via The Economist 32percent 
Does anybody think that  will get their fictitious  polling numbers corrected sometime prior to the start of the debate Sad
 can you believe Kasie Hunt's poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in Iowa  is a scam
 continues to report fictious poll numbers Number one based on every statistic is Trump (by a wide margin) They just can't say it
After a great evening and packed auditorium in Iowa I am now in Colorado looking forward to what I am sure will be a very unfair debate
Thank you Iowa Great night---see you soon

New Gravis national poll just out --- 36percent Very nice 
Dopey  who has lost all credibility with so many dumb statements and  picks said last week on  that Biden was in
 Watch my appearance on the  from this morning 
All Presidential candidates should immediately disavow their Super PAC’s They're not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself
Re Super PAC scam  What the other candidates are doing is a disgrace
This whole Super PAC scam is very unfair to a person like me who has disavowed all PAC's  is self-funding

This is just not the right time for Jeb Bush His campaign is in total disarray too much staff being paid way too much money = US GOVT
I will be doing a major sit down interview on State of the Union With Jake Tapper at 9:00 AM on  Enjoy
While Jeb Bush is cutting staff and salaries after having paid ridiculous amounts of money why did he pay so much in the first place
 is slashing campaign salaries people making millions If he can't manage his campaign how can he manage our countries finances
 had a tiny 300 person crowd at Senator Tim Scott's forum I had thousands and they had real passion 
 is totally lost -- he spends too much time managing the bloated staff of his campaign  not enough talking about America's future
Expecting a great crowd of amazing people Questions will be live 
I will be doing the  live from New Hampshire at 7am on Monday morning 
Will be doing a sit down interview with    on Sunday morning at 9:00 Tough questions and hopefully very good answers

Does everyone remember    and his famous remarks about self-deportation and 47percent He was done I don't need his angry advice
 and his campaign manager should not be critical of candidates after they blew an election that should never have been lost
  can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because I have been openly hard on his terrible choke loss to Obama

Jeb why did your brother attack and destabalize the Middle East by attacking Iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction Bad info
This morning Chris Wallace has the best political show on television but that's only because I'm on it (kidding) Have fun
Jeb Bush should stop trying to defend his brother and focus on his own shortcomings and how to fix them Also Rubio is hitting him hard

Carly Fiorina is terrible at business--the last thing our country needs
 Send me your questions to answer live from  later this afternoon
New Zogby poll highly respected but the media won’t report it because it gives me an even bigger lead    
The  refused to use their just in poll numbers where I have a massive lead but instead used  numbers where my lead is smaller
Will be on   now Enjoy
Carly Fiorina did such a horrible job at Lucent and HP virtually destroying both companies that she never got another CEO job offer Pres
We are going to WIN and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN maybe better than ever before
I am attracting the biggest crowds by far and the best poll numbers also by far   Much of the media is totally dishonest So sad
I have been leading big in all  polls with two more today  and  The NBC poll is more than double next  at 29percent Fiorina has 11percent
There is no way that Carly  Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems Boxer killed her for Senate in California

If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president do you really think he would come to my rescue No chance
This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something
Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him I don't think so

Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me
