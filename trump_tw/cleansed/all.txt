republican party and more importantly our country needs the presidency more than ever before the power of the veto stay strong states want to correct their votes which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud plus corrupt process never received legislative approval  all mike pence has to do is send them back to the states and we win do it mike this is a time for extreme courage

terrorist organization stay out of washington law enforcement is watching you very closely        i hope the democrats and even more importantly the weak and ineffective rino section of the republican

election victory stolen by emboldened radical left democrats our country has had enough they won't take it anymore we hear you and love you from the oval office make america great again georgia get

senators  and  so important to do so pleased to announce that    have just joined our great  group of senators they will fight the ridiculous electoral college certification of biden how do you certify numbers that have now proven to be wrong and in many cases fraudulent on my way see you soon  heading to georgia now see you soon the surrender caucus within the republican party will go down in infamy as weak and ineffective guardians of our nation who were willing to accept the certification of fraudulent presidential numbers we are not acting to thwart the democratic process we are acting to protect it  we've seen in the last few months unprecedented amounts of voter fraud   true how can you certify an election when the numbers being certified are verifiably wrong you will see the real numbers tonight during my speech but especially on january 6th  republicans have pluses  minuses but one thing is sure they never forget sorry but the number of votes in the swing states that we are talking about is very large and totally outcome determinative only the democrats and some rino's would dare dispute this even though they know it is true       the world the swing states did not even come close to following the dictates of their state legislatures these states  election laws were made up by local judges  politicians not by their legislatures  are therefore before even getting to irregularities  fraud unconstitutional trump speaks to state legislators on call about decertifying election  via  i will be there historic day  great  something how dr fauci is revered by the lamestream media as such a great professional having done they say such an incredible job yet he works for me and the trump administration and i am in no way given any credit for my work gee could this just be more fake news georgia election data just revealed shows that over 17000 votes illegally flipped from trump to biden   this alone there are many other irregularities is enough to easily swing georgia to trump      i spoke to secretary of state brad raffensperger yesterday about fulton county and voter fraud in georgia he was unwilling or unable to answer questions such as the ballots under table scam ballot destruction out of state voters dead voters and more he has no clue republicans in georgia must be careful of the political corruption in fulton county which is rampant the governor  and his puppet lt governor  have done less than nothing they are a disgrace to the great people of georgia the number of cases and deaths of the china virus is far exaggerated in the united states because of  ridiculous method of determination compared to other countries many of whom report purposely very inaccurately and low when in doubt call it covid fake news the vaccines are being delivered to the states by the federal government far faster than they can be administered gop senators join hawley in objecting to electoral college votes  via  so true thanks josh  an attempt to steal a landslide win can't let it happen  and after they see the facts plenty more to comeour country will love them for it   wow i guess it's not good to go against a president who everyone in georgia knows got you into office   mitch m and all  civil war tucker carlson hits his own network in epic post-election monologue  just a small portion of these votes give us a big and conclusive win in georgia have they illegally destroyed ballots in fulton county after many weeks we don't yet even have a judge to hear this large scale voter fraud case the only judge seems to be stacey's sister

thousands of others who voted illegally from the final vote tally make america great again will be in georgia on monday night 9:00 pm to rally for two great people    get ready to vote on tuesday

are no longer forced to pay a fortune for the privilege of not getting bad healthcare this ended obamacare as we knew it thank you some states are very slow to inoculate recipients despite successful and very large scale distribution of vaccines by the federal government they will get it done because of the trump administration hospitals are now required effective immediately to publish their real prices which will create competition and drive downs costs massively won lawsuit last week bigger than healthcare it's called price transparency please remember who got it done only because biden got very few votes just like the election  herschel is speaking the truth  thank you madison  republicans should have gotten rid of section 230 in the defense bill and you wouldn't have had this problem never learn  january 6th see you in dc  before even discussing the massive corruption which took place in the 2020 election which gives us far more votes than is necessary to win all of the swing states only need three it must be noted that the state legislatures were not in any way responsible for the massive is therefore both illegal and invalid and that would include the two current senatorial elections in wisconsin voters not asking for applications invalidates the election all of this without even discussing the millions of fraudulent votes that were cast or altered changes made to the voting process rules and regulations many made hastily before the election and therefore the whole state election is not legal or constitutional additionally the georgia consent decree is unconstitutional  the state 2020 presidential election our republican senate just missed the opportunity to get rid of section 230 which gives unlimited power to big tech companies pathetic now they want to give people ravaged by the china virus $600 rather than the $2000 which they so desperately need not fair or smart  weekend daytime is not watchable switching over to  a great honor  now

place thank you to the georgia legislature for today's revealing meeting  his puppet lt governor  and secretary of state are disasters for georgia won't let professionals get anywhere near fulton county for signature verifications or anything else they are virtually controlled by   the democrats fools watching  is almost as bad as watching fake news  new alternatives are developing the united states had more votes than it had people voting by a lot this travesty cannot be allowed to stand it was a rigged election one not even fit for third world countries january sixth see you in dc twitter is shadow banning like never before a disgrace that our weak and ineffective political leadership refuses to do anything about big tech they're either afraid or stupid nobody really knows thank you a great honor  hearings from atlanta on the georgia election overturn now being broadcast live via    hearings from atlanta on the georgia election overturn now being broadcast check it out   and many more  should resign from office he is an obstructionist who refuses to admit that we won georgia big also won the other swing states $2000 asap the federal government has distributed the vaccines to the states now it is up to the states to administer get moving barack obama was toppled from the top spot and president trump claimed the title of the year's most admired man trump number one obama number two and joe biden a very distant number three that's also rather odd given the fact that on november 3rd biden allegedly racked up millions more votes than trump but can't get anywhere close to him in this poll no incoming president has ever done as badly in this annual survey   that's because he got millions of fake votes in the 2020 election which was rigged new lott study estimates 11350 absentee votes lost to trump in georgia another 289000 excess fraudulent votes across ga az mi nv pa and wi check it out ➡️  other acts of fraud and irregularities as well stay tuned that quite frankly didn't have much of a chance like 7 8 or 9 the presidential election was rigged with hundreds of thousands of ballots mysteriously flowing into swing states very late at night as everyone thought the election was easily won by me there were many the wall street journal's very boring  incoherent editorial fails to mention my big  easy wins in texas florida ohio iowa  many other states that the   other joke polls said i would lose also they fail to mention the fact that i got many republican senators elected the consent decree signed by the secretary with the consent of kemp is perhaps even more poorly negotiated than the deal that john kerry made with iran now it turns out that brad r's brother works for china and they definitely don't want trump so disgusting  i love the great state of georgia but the people who run it from the governor  to the secretary of state are a complete disaster and don't have a clue or worse nobody can be this stupid just allow us to find the crime and turn the state republican when are we going to be allowed to do signature verification in fulton county georgia the process is going very slowly  pennsylvania just found 205000 votes more than they had voters therefore we win pennsylvania it is up to the states to distribute the vaccines once brought to the designated areas by the federal government we have not only developed the vaccines including putting up money to move the process along quickly but gotten them to the states biden failed with swine flu loeffler perdue support increasing relief payments to $2k  via  republicans must support the $2000 payments and must fight the crooked presidential election we won big unless republicans have a death wish and it is also the right thing to do they must approve the $2000 payments asap $600 is not enough also get rid of section 230 don't let big tech steal our country and don't let the democrats steal the presidential election get tough  and congressmen/congresswomen elected i do believe they forgot can you imagine if the republicans stole a presidential election from the democrats all hell would break out republican leadership only wants the path of least resistance our leaders not me of course are pathetic they only know how to lose ps i got many senators more votes than is needed by me to win pennsylvania not to mention hundreds of thousands of votes in other categories which increase my already big lead into a landslide all other swing states show likewise we need new  energetic republican leadership this can not stand a group of republican lawmakers in pennsylvania say 200000 more votes were counted in the 2020 election than voters 100percent went to biden state representative frank ryan said they found troubling discrepancies after an analysis of election day data  this is far $2000 for our great people not $600 they have suffered enough from the china virus weak and tired republican leadership will allow the bad defense bill to pass say goodbye to vital section 230 termination your national monuments forts names and treasures inserted by elizabeth pocahontas warren 5g and our great soldiers being removed and brought home from foreign lands who do nothing for us a disgraceful act of cowardice and total submission by weak people to big tech negotiate a better bill or get better leaders now senate should not approve ndaa until fixed give the people $2000 not $600 they have suffered enough  breaking news in pennsylvania there were 205000 more votes than there were voters this alone flips the state to

history we will win fake signatures illegal immigrant voters banned republican vote watchers more votes than actual voters check out detroit  philadelphia and much more the numbers are far greater than what is necessary to win the individual swing states and cannot even be contested courts are bad the fbi and justice didn't do their job and the united states election system looks like that of a third world country freedom of the press has been gone for a long time it is fake news and now we have big tech with section 230 to deal with time for republican senators to step up and fight for the presidency like the democrats would do if they had actually won the proof is irrefutable massive late night mail-in ballot drops in swing states stuffing the ballot boxes on video double voters dead voters the lockdowns in democrat run states are absolutely ruining the lives of so many people far more than the damage that would be caused by the china virus cases in california have risen despite the lockdown yet florida  others are open  doing well common sense please thank you mark big numbers found in arizonawe must win for our country  i simply want to get our great people $2000 rather than the measly $600 that is now in the bill also stop the billions of dollars in pork a young military man working in afghanistan told me that elections in afghanistan are far more secure and much better run than the usa's 2020 election ours with its millions and millions of corrupt mail-in ballots was the election of a third world country fake president the us supreme court has been totally incompetent and weak on the massive election fraud that took place in the 2020 presidential election we have absolute proof but they don't want to see it no standing they say if we have corrupt elections we have no country where the hell is the durham report they spied on my campaign colluded with russia and others and got caught read the horowitz reports about comey  mccabe even the fake news  said bad they tried it all and failed so now they are trying to steal the election i simply want to get out great people $2000 rather than the measly $600 that is now in the bill also stop the billions of dollars in pork the justice department and the fbi have done nothing about the 2020 presidential election voter fraud the biggest scam in our nation's history despite overwhelming evidence they should be ashamed history will remember never give up see everyone in dc on january 6th if a democrat presidential candidate had an election rigged  stolen with proof of such acts at a level never seen before the democrat senators would consider it an act of war and fight to the death mitch  the republicans do nothing just want to let it pass no fight i simply wan to get our great people $2000 rather than $600 also congress should cut the pork  i will not stand by and watch this travesty of a bill happen without reigning in big tech end section 230 now before it is too late so bad for our country show courage and do what's right  our $740 defense bill is a gift to china russia  big tech it fails to terminate the internationally dangerous section 230 won't allow us to bring our troops back home where they belong renames  destroys our forts  national monuments  makes 5g almost impossible  but we already know enough and we won big  thank you  going now to make a short speech to service members from all over the world it is a celebration of christmas video conference fake news not invited the greatest of all time fake news  made many calls and had meetings at trump international in palm beach florida why would politicians not want to give people $2000 rather than only $600 it wasn't their fault it was china give our people the money merry christmas i saved at least 8 republican senators including mitch from losing in the last rigged for president election now they almost all sit back and watch me fight against a crooked and vicious foe the radical left democrats i will never forget twitter is going wild with their flags trying hard to suppress even the truth just shows how dangerous they are purposely stifling free speech very dangerous for our country does congress know that this is how communism starts cancel culture at its worst end section 230 voter fraud is not a conspiracy theory it is a fact maria's show and ratings are better than ever they are trying to shame her into not telling the truth her audience would be gone and she is far too smart for that rigged election  at a meeting in florida today everyone was asking why aren't the republicans up in arms  fighting over the fact that the democrats stole the rigged presidential election especially in the senate they said where you helped 8 senators win their races how quickly they forget more than one million americans have already received the china virus vaccine a record pace rush is the greatest  after seeing the massive voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election i disagree with anyone that thinks a strong fast and fair special counsel is not needed immediately this was the most corrupt election in the history of our country and it must be closely examined some friendly health advice to iran if one american is killed i will hold iran responsible think it over our embassy in baghdad got hit sunday by several rockets three rockets failed to launch guess where they were from iran now we hear chatter of additional attacks against americans in iraq  they are slow walking the signature verification in georgia they don't want results to get out prior to january

will soon see the great miracle of what the trump administration has accomplished they said it couldn't be done conservatives call on state legislators to appoint new electors in accordance with the constitution  republicans in wisconsin should take these 3 strong decisions to their state legislators and overturn this ridiculous state election we won in a landslide wow he just voted against me in a big court decision on voter fraud of which there was much despite many pages of dissent from three highly respected justices one thing has nothing to do with another but we ended up losing 4-3 in a really incorrect ruling great two years ago the great people of wisconsin asked me to endorse a man named brian hagedorn for state supreme court justice when he was getting destroyed in the polls against a tough democrat candidate who had no chance of losing after my endorsement hagedorn easily won  will not be able to win on january 5th unless these people allow signature verification in presidential race k  d need it for their race also  georgia spirit will rise to such a high that they will easily bring home a great victory move fast  governor  and his puppet  together with the secretary of state of georgia are very slow on signature verification and won't allow fulton county to be examined what are these rinos hiding we will easily win presidential state race  and big news coming out of pennsylvania very big illegal ballot drop that cannot be accounted for rigged election the president was responsible for those direct payments to americans in the covid-19 relief bill

want to have lockdowns the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself  the entire world is being badly hurt by the china virus but if you listen to the fake news lamestream media and big tech you would think that we are the only one no but we are the country that developed vaccines and years ahead of schedule  very happy to have helped get  america so beautifully open and operating today congratulations to all of those who have worked so hard for this great success discussing the possibility that it may be china it may there could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election which is now obvious that i won big making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the usa   the cyber hack is far greater in the fake news media than in actuality i have been fully briefed and everything is well under control russia russia russia is the priority chant when anything happens because lamestream is for mostly financial reasons petrified of he didn't win the election he lost all 6 swing states by a lot they then dumped hundreds of thousands of votes in each one and got caught now republican politicians have to fight so that their great victory is not

pennsylvania flagrantly violated laws ahead of election senate hearings going on live  as to the fraudulent 2020 election that just took place  doing an excellent job nevada must be flipped based on

they waited to find out how many ballots they had to produce in order to steal the rigged election they were so far behind that they needed time  a fake water main break to recover a great honor  what a fool governor  of georgia is could have been so easy but now we have to do it the hard way demand this clown call a special session and open up signature verification now otherwise could be a bad day for two great senators on january 5th democrats weakened the signature verification and other safeguards in georgia  played   secretary of state for fools consent decree which is terrible for

so at the appropriate time thank you vaccines are shipped and on their way five years ahead of schedule get well usa get well world we love you all place in detroit philadelphia milwaukee atlanta pittsburgh and elsewhere in all swing state cases there are far more votes than are necessary to win the state and the election itself therefore votes cannot be certified this election is under protest and many others voted illegally also machine glitches another word for fraud ballot harvesting non-resident voters fake ballots stuffing the ballot box votes for pay roughed up republican poll watchers and sometimes even more votes than people voting took swing states that have found massive voter fraud which is all of them cannot legally certify these votes as complete  correct without committing a severely punishable crime everybody knows that dead people below age people illegal immigrants fake signatures prisoners they just chickened out and didn't want to rule on the merits of the case so bad for our country the fact that the supreme court wouldn't find standing in an original jurisdiction matter between multiple states and including the president of the states is absurd it is enumerated in the constitution tens of millions of haphazardly ballots sent with some people getting two three or four ballots we will never give up the rinos that run the state voting apparatus have caused us this problem of allowing the democrats to so blatantly cheat in their attempt to steal the election which we won overwhelmingly how dare they allow this massive and ridiculous mail-in voting to occur the biggest winner of our new defense bill is china i will veto most corrupt election in us history how do states and politicians confirm an election where corruption and irregularities are documented throughout a swing state hustle the drug companies are going crazy putting up nasty ads against me asking to withdraw my favored nation's executive order they don't want the us to have the lowest drug prices in the world but we now will big reductions coming no other politician would do this if failing governor  would allow signature verification david  kelly would win the supreme court had zero interest in the merits of the greatest voter fraud ever perpetrated on the united states of america all they were interested in is standing which makes it very difficult for the president to present a case on the merits 75000000 votes wow thousands of people forming in washington dc for stop the steal didn't know about this but i'll be seeing them  why didn't bill barr reveal the truth to the public before the election about hunter biden joe was lying on the debate stage that nothing was wrong or going on press confirmed big disadvantage for republicans at the polls we have just begun to fight if biden gets in nothing will happen to hunter or joe barr will do nothing and the new group of partisan killers coming in will quickly kill it all same thing with durham we caught them cold spying treason  more the hard part but justice took too long will be doa a big disappointment  i have been doing this i agree  who is a worse governor  of georgia or  of arizona these are two rino republicans who fought against me and the republican party harder than any democrat they allowed states that i won easily to be stolen never forget vote them out of office i won the election in a landslide but remember i only think in terms of legal votes not all of the fake voters and fraud that miraculously floated in from everywhere what a disgrace justices alito and thomas say they would have allowed texas to proceed with its election lawsuit   this is a great and disgraceful miscarriage of justice the people of the united states were cheated and our country disgraced never even given our day in court georgia gop chair says ‘we are trusting no one' promises ‘eyes on every part' of voting process  via   you can't rely on  unlike other governors for the many states i won he lost total control signature verification we've not gotten any court to judge this the vote on its merit  of texas it is a legal disgrace an embarrassment to the usa fda approves pfizer vaccine for emergency use that after careful study and consideration think you got screwed something which will hurt them also many others likewise join the suit but within a flash it is thrown out and gone without even looking at the many reasons it was brought a rigged election fight on so you're the president of the united states and you just went through an election where you got more votes than any sitting president in history by far and purportedly lost you can't get standing before the supreme court so you intervene with wonderful states the supreme court really let us down no wisdom no courage the american people deserve answers better late than never   don't the voters have to know what the federal prosecutor's know the establishment failed us the media congressional leaders the democrat party no wonder 74 a pres record million americans voted for donald trump  they still don't believe the outcome of this election georgia where is signature verification approval what do you have to lose must move quickly    if the supreme court shows great wisdom and courage the american people will win perhaps the most important case in history and our electoral process will be respected again if the two senators from georgia should lose which would be a horrible thing for our country i am the only thing that stands between packing the court last number heard 25 and preserving it i will not under any circumstances pack the court donald trump must get the credit for the vaccines it is a miracle   now it turns out that the democrats want the pack the court with 26 justices this would be terrible and must be stopped even justice rbg was strongly opposed now that the biden administration will be a scandal plagued mess for years to come it is much easier for the supreme court of the united states to follow the constitution and do what everybody knows has to be done they must show great courage  wisdom save the usa now it turns out that my phone call to the president of ukraine which many including me have called perfect was even better than that i predicted biden corruption said to call the ag who perhaps knew of the corruption during the impeachment hoax i just want to stop the world from killing itself the swine flu h1n1 and the attempt for a vaccine by the obama administration with joe biden in charge was a complete and total disaster now they want to come in and take over one of the greatest and fastest medical miracles in modern day history i don't think so while my pushing the money drenched but heavily bureaucratic  saved five years in the approval of numerous great new vaccines it is still a big old slow turtle get the dam vaccines out now dr hahn  stop playing games and start saving lives no war with north korea tamed fighting in idlib province and many other places no wars started by us troop removals all over and so much more thank you larry  why didn't the fake news media the fbi and the doj report the biden matter before the election oh well it's ok we won the election anyway 75000000 votes tremendous support from all over the country all we ask is courage  wisdom from those that will be making one of the most important decisions in our country's history god bless you 19 states are fighting for us almost unheard of support no presidential candidate ever came even close to losing an election who won iowa florida and ohio i won all three by a lot so true a must read  morocco recognized the united states in 1777  it is thus fitting we recognize their sovereignty over the western sahara another historic breakthrough today our two great friends israel and the kingdom of morocco have agreed to full diplomatic relations  a massive breakthrough for peace in the middle east today i signed a proclamation recognizing moroccan sovereignty over the western sahara  morocco's serious credible and realistic autonomy proposal is the only basis for a just and lasting solution for enduring peace and prosperity

fan at georgia rally on   bad people are upset and they have a right to be georgia not only supported trump in 2016 but now this is the only state in the deep south that went for biden have they lost their minds this is going to escalate dramatically this is a very dangerous moment in our history donald trump won by a landslide and they stole it from him  how does governor  allow certification of votes without verifying signatures and despite the recently released tape of ballots being stuffed his poll numbers have dropped like a rock he is finished as governor  how can you give an election to someone who lost the election by hundreds of thousands of legal votes in each of the swing states how can a country be run by an illegitimate president the supreme court has a chance to save our country from the greatest election abuse in the history of the united states 78percent of the people feel know the election was rigged wisdom  courage 10percent of voters would have changed their vote if they knew about hunter biden miranda devine    but i won anyway if you're looking for election rigging look no further that's what this is they kept information from the public in order to influence the outcome of the election they rigged it  wow at least 17 states have joined texas in the extraordinary case against the greatest election fraud in the history of the united states thank you at 10:00 pm on election evening we were at 97percent win with the so-called bookies if somebody cheated in the election which the democrats did why wouldn't the election be immediately overturned how can a country be run like this  no candidate has ever won both florida and ohio and lost i won them both by a lot  we will soon be learning about the word courage and saving our country i received hundreds of thousands of legal votes more in all of the swing states than did my opponent   all data taken after the vote says that it was impossible for me to lose unless fixed this case had nothing to do with me fake news as usual  stock markets at new all time highs rigged election there is massive evidence of widespread fraud in the four states plus mentioned in the texas suit just look at all

ballots was probably our least secure ever we have some big things happening in our various litigations on the election hoax everybody knows it was rigged they know biden didn't get more votes from

votes stay tuned  daytime is virtually unwatchable especially during the weekends watch   or almost anything else you won't have to suffer through endless interviews with democrats and even worse alan

except those of detroit more votes than people philadelphia atlanta and milwaukee which he had to win not surprisingly they are all located in the most important swing states and are long known for being politically corrupt biden can only enter the white house as president if he can prove that his ridiculous 80000000 votes were not fraudulently or illegally obtained when you see what happened in detroit atlanta philadelphia  milwaukee massive voter fraud he's got a big unsolvable problem big tech and the fake news media have partnered to suppress freedom of the press is gone a thing of the past that's why they refuse to report the real facts and figures of the 2020 election or even where's hunter  so much truth  all newly rebuilt military  yesterday's news conference being broadcast in full now on  enjoy no the 2020 election was a total scam we won by a lot and will hopefully turn over the fraudulent result but we must get out and help david and kelly two great people otherwise we

make it up and only negative stuff same thing will happen to twitter as is happening to  daytime also big conservative discrimination i gave a long news conference today after wishing the military a happy thanksgiving  realized once again that the fake news media coordinates so that the real message of such a conference never gets out primary point made was that the 2020 election was rigged and that i won a must read impossible for biden to have overcome these and even greater odds  a brilliant woman of courage  so much truth  will go down much further weekend daytime even worse dead they

witnesses to the contrary welcome to the roaring 20's but 2020 is a long way from over  marc morano   perhaps president trump's greatest accomplishment is united states energy dominance should

helpful to  and  why is he afraid of stacey abrams we don't need the ballots  we only need the signed envelopes why isn't the  brad raffensperger a so-called republican allowing us to look at signatures on envelopes for verification we will find tens of thousands of fraudulent and illegal votes america first on behalf of the entire trump family i want to wish every american a healthy and happy thanksgiving today we gathered in the rose garden to continue a beloved annual tradition the official presidential pardon of a very fortunate thanksgiving turkey  remember the gsa has been terrific and emily murphy has done a great job but the gsa does not determine who the next president of the united states will be that says it all about mattis obama fired him i should have fired him

corrupt election in american political history we are moving full speed ahead will never concede to fake ballots  dominion fight and i believe we will prevail nevertheless in the best interest of our country i am recommending that emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols and have told my team to do the same i want to thank emily murphy at gsa for her steadfast dedication and loyalty to our country she has been harassed threatened and abused  and i do not want to see this happen to her her family or employees of gsa our case strongly continues we will keep up the good data trump‘s anti-globalism pro-police message wins over hispanics  via  great but we also won the election in certain swing states there were more votes than people who voted and in big numbers does that not really matter stopping poll watchers voting for unsuspecting people fake ballots and so much more such egregious conduct we will win  note to     report maryland gov larry hogan anti-trump hero paid for flawed coronavirus tests from south korea  via  this rino will never make the grade hogan is just as bad as the flawed tests he paid big money for other than politics how do

fraudulent votes cast enough to easily flip the election you're just unhappy that i'm bringing the troops back home where they belong  well there were hundreds of thousands of votes cast where republican poll watchers were not allowed to watch not even allowed in the counting rooms likewise with fake ballots cast and dead people voting  this is not at all frivolous it is brought on behalf of one of the most respected members of the united states congress who is disgusted like so many others by an election that is a fraudulent mess fake ballots dead people voting no republican poll watchers allowed  more  the courage to do what has to be done to maintain the integrity of our elections  and the united states of america itself the world is watching why is joe biden so quickly forming a cabinet when my investigators have found hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes enough to flip at least four states which in turn is more than enough to win the election hopefully the courts and/or legislatures will have the media is just as corrupt as the election itself fake news always forgets to mention that far fewer people are dying when they get covid this is do to both our advanced therapeutics and the gained knowledge of our great doctors nurses and front line workers the fake news is not talking about the fact that covid is running wild all over the world not just in the us i was at the virtual g-20 meeting early this morning and the biggest subject was covid we will be healing fast especially with our vaccines joe biden was a total disaster in handling the h1n1 swine flu would never have produced a vaccine in record time years ahead of schedule and would do a terrible job of vaccine delivery but doesn't everybody already know that president trump has done many great things biggest tax  regulation cuts in history space force rebuilding our military fixing the va the wall but perhaps the most important of all will be what he is doing now exposing the

unbelievable  thank you  so nice   floyd county georgia   georgia   the great state of michigan with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted cannot certify the election the democrats cheated big time and got caught a republican win in detroit there are far more votes than people nothing can be done to cure that giant scam i win michigan the numbers have not improved it is still 71percent out of balance stated wayne county michigan  canvassers there is widespread irregularities in poll numbers there are more votes than people the two harassed patriot canvassers refuse to sign the papers they would'nt let republican poll watchers into the counting rooms unconstitutional the georgia recount is a joke and is being done under protest even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found the real number is in matching signatures governor must open up the unconstitutional consent decree and call in the legislature they didn't even allow republican observers into the building to watch a terrible insult to our constitution  this was a rigged election no republican poll watchers allowed voting machine glitches all over the place meaning they got caught cheating voting after election ended and so much more  wrong at first they voted against because there were far more votes than people sad then they were threatened screamed at and viciously harassed and were forced to change their vote but then refused as american patriots to sign the documents 71percent mess don't harass  and i won the election voter fraud all over the country  trump votes  wow governor kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late must finally take charge two great senators who do so much for georgia and truly love the usa are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don't have a clue  well it's really quite simple you just can't have more votes than people  more votes than people and that is the least of it  flip michigan back to trump detroit not surprisingly has tremendous problems  wow michigan just refused to certify the election results having courage is a beautiful thing the usa stands proud just found thousands of more ballots and the recount is relatively meaningless without being given access to the signatures consent decree is a scam that georgia secretary of state or governor should never have let happen unconstitutional open it up  second georgia county finds thousands more votes majority are for trump  the only thing secure about our 2020 election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers on that the trump administration takes great credit unfortunately the radical left democrats dominion and others were perhaps more successful thank you  the recent statement by chris krebs on the security of the 2020 election was highly inaccurate in that there were massive improprieties and fraud including dead people voting poll watchers not allowed into polling locations glitches in the voting machines which changed votes from trump to biden late voting and many more therefore effective immediately chris krebs has been terminated as director of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency dead people voted  this says it all  i have reversed the ridiculous decision to cancel wreaths across america at arlington national cemetery it will now go on big victory moments ago in the state of nevada the all democrat county commissioner race on same ballot as president just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy clark county officials do not have confidence in their own election security major impact  the rate of rejected mail-in ballots is 30 x's lower in pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016 this is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the sacred vote counting rooms  georgia won't let us look at the all important signature match without that the recount is meaningless open up unconstitutional consent decree now  european countries are sadly getting clobbered by the china virus the fake news does not like reporting this stock market getting very close to 30000 on new vaccine news 95percent effective they will pack the courts we won't let that happen the radical left democrats working with their partner the fake news media are trying to steal this election we won't let them trump campaign rejects media reports of changed pennsylvania case  via  just more fake news harassment and exclusion of our poll watchers is a big part of our case unconstitutional who will be running for governor of the great state of ohio will be hotly contested another vaccine just announced this time by moderna 95percent effective for those great historians please remember that these great discoveries which will end the china plague all took place on my watch try watching  really great the fake recount going on in georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified break the unconstitutional consent decree i won the election i strongly stand with kelly  david they are both great and must win  dominion is running our election rigged  thank you andrew  most fraudulent election in history  this is crazy  no way  the washington post forgot to read the complaint fake news poll watchers and the way they were treated are a very big deal in the complaint  i won the election owned dominion voting systems turned down by texas and many others because it was not good or secure those responsible for the safeguarding of our constitution cannot allow the fake results of the 2020 mail-in election to stand the world is watching perhaps like never before from large numbers of poll watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our states to millions of ballots that have been altered by democrats only for democrats to voting after the election was over to using radical left why does the fake news media continuously assume that joe biden will ascend to the presidency not even allowing our side to show which we are just getting ready to do how badly shattered and violated our great constitution has been in the 2020 election it was attacked a great launch  was a closed up disaster when we took over now it is again the hottest most advanced space center in the world by far  many of the court cases being filed all over the country are not ours but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 election  the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome will soon be filed spirit like never before  amazing  we won't let a rigged election steal our country  watch dc cops direct trump-supporters into gauntlet of protesters do nothing when they are assaulted  via  these thugs and lowlifes only stalked and attacked when most of the tens of thousands of people had left town ran away earlier great job emily  john bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that i've had the pleasure to work with a sullen dull and quiet guy he added nothing to national security except gee let's go to war also illegally released much classified information a real dope rudy will be interviewed by  at 10:00 am now  progress  he only won in the eyes of the fake news media i concede nothing we have a long way to go this was a rigged election rigged election we will win watch  interview on  this morning at 10:00 doing a great job exposing the rigged election hoax all of the mechanical glitches that took place on election night were really them getting caught trying to steal votes they succeeded plenty however without getting caught mail-in elections are a sick joke he won because the election was rigged no vote watchers or observers allowed vote tabulated by a radical left privately owned company dominion with a bad reputation  bum equipment that couldn't even qualify for texas which i won by a lot the fake  silent media  more  doing a great job in georgia their recount is a scam means nothing must see fraudulent signatures which is prohibited by stupidly signed  unconstitutional consent decree   this is why  daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings they are abysmal having  mayor pete of indiana's most unsuccessful city by far on more than republicans many great alternatives are forming  exist try    among others  tax filings reveal biden cancer charity spent millions on salaries zero on research  via  thank you mark but the fake news media will never say it  the fake news media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to dc formed organically and in many parts of the country  thank you mollie the free and fair press is gone in our country they only write about what they want to write about suppression  the silent media is the enemy of the people  human radical left garbage did this being arrested now  radical left antifa scum was easily rebuffed today by the big dc maga rally crowd only to return at night after 99percent of the crowd had left to assault elderly people and families police got there but late mayor is not doing her job antifa scum ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the trump rally because those people aggressively fought back antifa waited until tonight when 99percent were gone to attack innocent  people dc police get going  do your job and don't hold back antifa scum ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the trump rally because those people aggressively fought back antifa waited until tonight when 99percent were gone to attack innocent  people dc police get going  do you job and don't hold back i look forward to mayor giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend our right to free and fair elections rudy giuliani joseph digenova victoria toensing sidney powell and jenna ellis a truly great team added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives there is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms michigan pennsylvania georgia and others unconstitutional  and the fake news networks aren't showing these massive gatherings instead they have their reporters standing in almost empty streets we now have suppression by the press maga  thank you dan  they wouldn't let our poll watchers and observers into the counting rooms we win on that alone the hand recount taking place in georgia is a waste of time they are not showing the matching signatures call off the recount until they allow the match don't let the radical left dems steal the election hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in dc they will not stand for a rigged and corrupt election  we will win  people are not going to stand for having this election stolen from them by a privately owned radical left company dominion and many other reasons  we cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the vaccine immediately therefore the new york delay many lives to be saved but we are ready when they are stop playing politics i love new york as everyone knows the trump administration has produced a great and safe vaccine far ahead of schedule another administration would have taken five years the problem is  said that he will delay using it and other states want it now congress must now do a covid relief bill needs democrats support make it big and focused get it done what are they trying to hide they know and so does everyone else expose the crime the consent decree signed by the georgia secretary of state with the approval of governor  at the urging of  makes it impossible to check  match signatures on ballots and envelopes etc they knew they were going to cheat must expose real signatures republican burgess owens defeats democrat rep ben mcadams in utah  via  great going burgess you continue to be a star highly rated  top us pollster and statistician richard baris  people's pundit  suspended from twitter for reporting on disputed election  political 'wrongthink' not allowed  via said 10000 dead people voted in michigan when will this rigged election be overturned wow this is exactly what happened to us great courage by judge  the worst thing you can do is bet against donald trump considering what has been done against him they flooded the zone with mail-in ballots we need every vote counted and ferociously   georgia secretary of state a so-called republican rino won't let the people checking the ballots see the signatures for fraud why without this the whole process is very unfair and close to meaningless everyone knows that we won the state where is  700000 ballots were not allowed to be viewed in philadelphia and pittsburgh which means based on our great constitution we win the state of pennsylvania victor joecks clark county election officials accepted my signature  on 8 ballot envelopes  will be having a press conference from the rose garden in 15 minutes now it is learned that the horrendous dominion voting system was used in arizona and big in nevada no wonder the result was a very close loss heartwarming to see all of the tremendous support out there especially the organic rallies that are springing up all over the country including a big one on saturday in dc i may even try to stop by and say hello this election was rigged from dominion all the way up  down for years the dems have been preaching how unsafe and rigged our elections have been now they are saying what a wonderful job the trump administration did in making 2020 the most secure election ever actually this is true except for what the democrats did rigged election alito ‘religious liberty is in danger of becoming a second-class right‘  via  fitton 2020 election update  via  these states in question should immediately be put in the trump win column biden did not win he lost by a lot   must see  takedown of the horrible inaccurate and anything but secure dominion voting system which is used in states where tens of thousands of votes were stolen from us and given to biden likewise the great  has a confirming and powerful piece report dominion deleted 27 million trump votes nationwide data analysis finds 221000 pennsylvania votes switched from president trump to biden 941000 trump votes deleted states using dominion voting systems switched 435000 votes from trump to biden    daytime ratings have completely collapsed weekend daytime even worse very sad to watch this happen but they forgot what made them successful what got them there they forgot the golden goose the biggest difference between the 2016 election and 2020 was  100percent correct  so beautiful  rigged election thanks ryan  thank you scott and stay tuned you are terrific  now 73000000 votes  ok i've seen enough what's going to happen to these guys mccabe comey  the gang of treasonous thugs    they and many others got caught do something from 200000 votes to less than 10000 votes if we can audit the total votes cast we will easily win arizona also  big jim is the greatest  it took long enough what is taking north carolina so long are they looking for more ballots to fix that one also now with a recount we will win georgia also pennsylvania  michigan wouldn't let our poll watchers  observers into counting rooms illegal  it attempted to alter our election and got caught  now 73000000 legal votes  nobody wants to report that pennsylvania and michigan didn't allow our poll watchers and/or vote observers to watch or observe this is responsible for hundreds of thousands of votes that should not be allowed to count therefore i easily win both states report the news i am pleased to announce that i have given my full support and endorsement to ronna mcdaniel to continue heading the republican national committee rnc with 72 million votes we received more votes than any sitting president in us history and we will win everyone is asking why the recent presidential polls were so inaccurate when it came to me because they are fake just like much of the lamestream media we will win  you are looking at ballots is this what our country has come to  a guy named al schmidt a philadelphia commissioner and so-called republican rino is being used big time by the fake  news media to explain how honest things were with respect to the election in philadelphia he refuses to look at a mountain of corruption  dishonesty we win richard hopkins pennsylvania postal worker recants ballot-tampering claim washington times   stays with the truth his original story the fake pollsters at  produced a possibly illegal suppression poll just before the election showing me down 17 points in wisconsin when in fact on election day the race was even  we are now preparing to win the state many such deplorable instances people will not accept this rigged election  obama spied on our campaign and got caught  i was in philadelphia watching fraud happen here's how it went down  they shut out our poll watchers and observers those hundreds of thousands of votes should not be allowed corrupt politics a brave patriot more  more people are stepping forward to expose this rigged election  he should pay a big price for his subversion  thanks dan big win for us in texas  that's why mike was number one in his class at west point  andrew mccabe was exposed for who he is today in the us senate he was totally destroyed an ignorant fool the great people of the fbi must make sure that he and his former boss james comey pay the price for what they have done to the reputation of the fbi but how many ballots were fraudulently cast for the dems did people vote after the election had ended did officials actually not allow observers and poll watchers to look for an honest count  i don't care what state you're in this computer voting system is wide open to fraud and intervention   true and wait until you see what's coming i don't care what state your in this computer voting system is wide open to fraud and intervention   true and wait until you see what's coming ballot corruption will be exposed tonight at 9:00pme on  on  pennsylvania party leadership votes are this week i hope they pick very tough and smart fighters we will win nate simington a very smart and qualified individual is having his senate hearing today republicans will hopefully confirm him to the fcc asap we need action now on this very important nomination    nate simington a very smart and qualified individual is having his senate hearing today republicans will hopefully confirm him to the fcc asap we need action now on this very important nomination    happy 245th birthday to the     republicans don't let andrew mccabe continue to get away with totally criminal activity what he did should never be allowed to happen to our country again fight for justice highly respected ken starr pennsylvania's three-day extension of the mail-in ballot deadline is a constitutional travesty legal scholars agree ballot counting abuse watch for massive ballot counting abuse and just like the early vaccine remember i told you so we will win we are making big progress results start to come in next week make america great again only because of president trump we are going to have a vaccine by the end of the year  ronny jackson texas congressman-elect president trump told us for some time we would be getting a vaccine by the end of the year and people laughed at him and here we are with pfizer getting fda approval by the end of this month he was right  nothing  nolte bret baier deletes tweet that exposed backlash against fox news  via  the  and the democrats didn't want to have me get a vaccine win prior to the election so instead it came out five days later  as i've said all along if joe biden were president you wouldn't have the vaccine for another four years nor would the  have ever approved it so quickly the bureaucracy would have destroyed millions of lives as i have long said  and the others would only announce a vaccine after the election because they didn't have the courage to do it before likewise the  should have announced it earlier not for political purposes but for saving lives the worst polling ever and then they'll be back in four years to do it again this is much more then voter and campaign finance suppression abc/wapo had me down 17 points in wisconsin the day before the election and i won in iowa the polls had us 4 points down and i won by 82percent fox news and quinnipiac were wrong on everything   abc/wapo nbc/wsj were so inaccurate with their polls on me that it really is tampering with an election they were so far off in their polling and in their attempt to suppress that they should be called out for election interference this is good news it means i won  cc    georgia will be a big presidential win as it was the night of the election pennsylvania prevented us from watching much of the ballot count unthinkable and illegal in this country wisconsin is looking very good needs a little time statutorily will happen soon   nevada is turning out to be a cesspool of fake votes    are finding things that when released will be absolutely shocking the threshold identification of ballots is turning out to be even bigger than originally anticipated a very large number of ballots are impacted stay tuned chris will do a great job mark esper has been terminated i would like to thank him for his service i am pleased to announce that christopher c miller the highly respected director of the national counterterrorism center unanimously confirmed by the senate will be acting secretary of defense effective immediately stock market up big vaccine coming soon report 90percent effective such great news watch  at 8:00 pm  will discuss the mail-in ballot hoax investigators dispatched after fulton county discovers ‘issue‘ with ballot reporting  via  since when does the lamestream media call who our next president will be we have all learned a lot in the last two weeks where it mattered they stole what they had to steal  we believe these people are thieves the big city machines are corrupt this was a stolen election best pollster in britain wrote this morning that this clearly was a stolen election that it's impossible to imagine that biden outran obama in some of these states and detroit with a long series of election problems to put it mildly  how these ballots were authenticated because if there's a problem in the system about authentication that would seriously affect the entire election and what concerns me is that we had over a hundred million mail-in ballot in cites like philladelphia supreme court justice to compel them to separate ballots that were received after the legislative deadline it required the intervention of justice alito that's a large group of ballots when you talk about systemic problems it's about we should look at the votes we're just beginning the tabulation stage we should look at these allegations we're seeing a number of affidavits that there has been voter fraud we have a history in this country of election problems in pennsylvania you had an order by a 71000000 legal votes the most ever for a sitting president the observers were not allowed into the counting rooms i won the election got 71000000 legal votes bad things happened which our observers were not allowed to see never happened before millions of mail-in ballots were sent to people who never asked for them i won this election by a lot georgia counties using same software as michigan counties also encounter ‘glitch'  via  what a total mess this election has been lawyer's press conference at four season's landscaping philadelphia enjoy big press conference today in philadelphia at four seasons total landscaping  11:30am four season's landscaping  lawyers press conference at four seasons philadelphia 11:00 am people were screaming stop the count  we demand transparency as legal observers were refused admittance to count rooms  bad things took place during those hours where legal transparency was viciously  crudely not allowed tractors blocked doors  windows were covered with thick cardboard so that observers could not see into the count rooms bad things happened inside big changes took place this would also change the election result in numerous states including pennsylvania which everyone thought was easily won on election night only to see a massive lead disappear without anyone being allowed to observe for long intervals of time what the happened tens of thousands of votes were illegally received after 8 pm on tuesday election day totally and easily changing the results in pennsylvania and certain other razor thin states as a separate matter hundreds of thousands of votes were illegally not allowed to be observed incredibly stated jim  we need an explanation as to how these numbers have been running up for the last two or three days matthew whitaker  i had such a big lead in all of these states late into election night only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by perhaps these leads will return as our legal proceedings move forward joe biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the president i could make that claim also legal proceedings are just now beginning where are the missing military ballots in georgia what happened to them with the attack by the radical left dems on the republican senate the presidency becomes even more important has been able to render decisions in a matter of days ken starr former independent counsel  hopefully this will be corrected at the supreme court of the united states also these late ballots past election day are illegal exactly what the president has been saying the supreme court in extraordinary circumstances legislature they just ignored that ignored the constitution now we bring it down to the counting houses and outrageously observers who are the sentinels of integrity  transparency were excluded pennsylvania has conducted itself in a horrible lawless way and this is what we know we have to go back to the state level and how this morass came to be in the first instance the governor wolf and the state supreme court flagrantly violated the constitution of the us the power to set these rules and regulations is vested in the philadelpiha has got a rotten history on election integrity   twitter is out of control made possible through the government gift of section 230 i easily win the presidency of the united states with legal votes cast the observers were not allowed in any way shape or form to do their job and therefore votes accepted during this period must be determined to be illegal votes us supreme court should decide so now the democrats are working to gain control of the us senate through their actions on john james david perdue and more would end the filibuster life 2a and would pack and rotate the court presidency becomes even more important we will win news conference at 6:30 pm stop the fraud all of the recent biden claimed states will be legally challenged by us for voter fraud and state election fraud plenty of proof just check out the media we will win america first big legal win in pennsylvania jobless claims dip to 751000 lowest since march  via  fmr nv ag laxalt ‘no question‘ trump would have won nevada ‘convincingly‘ without mail-in voting  via  any vote that came in after election day will not be counted stop the count detroit absentee ballot counting chaos blocked windows and observers  via  demands arise for pa attorney general to ‘step aside‘  via  our lawyers have asked for meaningful access but what good does that do the damage has already been done to the integrity of our system and to the presidential election itself this is what should be discussed there was a large number of secretly dumped ballots as has been widely reported we have claimed for electoral vote purposes the commonwealth of pennsylvania which won't allow legal observers the state of georgia and the state of north carolina each one of which has a big trump lead additionally we hereby claim the state of michigan if in fact we are winning pennsylvania big but the pa secretary of state just announced that there are millions of ballots left to be counted wow it looks like michigan has now found the ballots necessary to keep a wonderful young man john james out of the us senate what a terrible thing is happening they are working hard to make up 500000 vote advantage in pennsylvania disappear  asap likewise michigan and others they are finding biden votes all over the place  in pennsylvania wisconsin and michigan so bad for our country what is this all about  how come every time they count mail-in ballot dumps they are so devastating in their percentage and power of destruction last night i was leading often solidly in many key states in almost all instances democrat run  controlled then one by one they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted very strange and the pollsters got it completely

giant red wave coming practically nothing both senators became totally unelectable couldn't come even close to winning their primaries and decided to drop out of politics and gracefully retire  could

senators liddle' bob corker whose approval rating in tennessee went from 55percent to 4percent  jeff the flake flake whose approval rating in arizona went from 56percent to nomination to run for a second term then he went back to his rather stupid and obnoxious ways must feel he can't lose to a dem little ben is a liability to the republican party and an embarrassment to the great state of nebraska other than that he's just a wonderful guy the least effective of our 53 republican senators and a person who truly doesn't have what it takes to be great is little ben sasse of nebraska a

epa one trillion trees initiative will build on president donald trump's commitment  joe biden could not name a single law enforcement group that supports his candidacy the american people want law

lamestream media  wow  thank you    the trump doctrine earns president trump a third nobel peace prize nomination  joe biden just announced that he will not agree to a drug test gee i wonder why financial statements from  the time i announced i was going to run for president  showing all properties assets and debts it is a very impressive statement and also shows that i am the only president on record to give up my yearly $400000 plus presidential salary also if you look at the extraordinary assets owned by me which the fake news hasn't i am extremely under leveraged i have very little debt compared to the value of assets much of this information is already on file but i have long said that i may release the fake news media just like election time 2016 is bringing up my taxes  all sorts of other nonsense with illegally obtained information  only bad intent i paid many millions of dollars in taxes but was entitled like everyone else to depreciation  tax credits the ballots being returned to states cannot be accurately counted many things are already going very wrong great book  this is totally illegal hope that the us attorney in minnesota has this and other of her many misdeeds under serious review if not why not we will win minnesota because of her and law enforcement saved minneapolis  iron o range  fake news obamacare will be replaced with a much better and far cheaper alternative if it is terminated in the supreme court would be a big win for the usa watch the ballots wow nobody realized how far mini mike bloomberg went in bribing ex-prisoners to go out and

totally vulnerable unsolicited counterfeit ballot scam check it out  and i look at them as a bunch of well funded anarchists  thugs who are protected because the comey/mueller inspired fbi is simply unable or unwilling to find their funding source and allows them to get away with murder  law  order  on air force one heading to wisconsin biden refused to go there to apologize for not showing up for the failed democrat convention so funny to watch the fake news fawning over sleepy joe's ridiculous car press conference pathetic bob woodward's badly written book is very boring  totally obsolete

great life story i know you will do a tremendous job for japan and for the world look forward to talking soon   i am lowering not raising medicare premiums unsolicited ballots are uncontrollable totally open to election interference by foreign countries and will lead to massive chaos and confusion importantly we also won on the ballot cure provision waiting for the big federal decisions in pennsylvania nevada and elsewhere  state supreme court in pennsylvania just affirmed that ballot harvesting remains illegal we will be watching that the democrats do not ballot harvest a felony in other words the republican party won on the atrocious ballot harvesting scam egregious behavior which is just the way they want it this was not a mistake it was done illegally and on purpose we want mike  the democrat trump hater secretary of state of michigan purposely misprinted ballots for the military putting the wrong names on the ballot and actually listing a member of another party as a replacement for vice president  everybody is totally confused by their democrats only want bailout money for blue states that are doing badly they don't care about the people never did twitter makes sure that trending on twitter is anything bad fake or not about president donald trump so obvious what they are doing being studied now i am substantially lowering medicare premiums have instituted favored nations clause and rebates on drug companies never been done before drug companies are hitting me with fake ads just like sleepy joe be careful drug prices will be reduced massively and soon  there is a group of people largely radical left democrats that want election mayhem states must end this crazy mass sending of ballots also a gift to foreign interference into our election stop it now before it is too late the big unsolicited ballot states should give it up now before it is too late and ask people to go to the polling booths and like always before vote otherwise mayhem solicited ballots absentee are ok  because of the new and unprecedented massive amount of unsolicited ballots which will be sent to voters or wherever this year the nov 3rd election result may never be

ballots we had great rallies this past weekend after the governor of nevada worked very hard to cancel all of our venues despite the fact that he controls the state he failed but would have rather

locker room during national anthem  no thanks tell them to protest some other time and michigan and north carolina next up phony ballot voting hoax  great news mike  next up the ballot hoax  congratulations pennsylvania now we await the decision on the rigged ballot scam which is so bad for our country  rasmussen was one of the most accurate polls in 2016 actually i think based on crowds and enthusiasm of which sleepy joe has none that we are much higher than 51percent the only thing joe can count on is that a federal judge doesn't eviscerate the fake ballot rigging scam she should be ashamed of herself  today it was my profound honor to award seven extraordinary soldiers the distinguished flying cross for their remarkable courage to rescue their fellow citizens in california  i didn't know there would be even a question about this  abc's trump in trouble poll surveyed just 533 not likely voters asked over 20percent more biden supporters than conservatives  via    total fake poll abc is just like the rest of them our people have all left drudge he is a confused mess has no clue what happened down 51percent   they like revolver and others great just out 51percent approval rating in rasmussen poll 95percent in republican party stock market up big today will i ever be given credit for the markets and economy next year will be big a made up hoax that shows how low they are willing to go  i am helping minnesota greatly obiden was a minnesota disaster  his handlers and the fake news media are doing everything possible to get him through the election then he will resign or whatever and we are stuck with a super liberal wack job that nobody wanted  pathetic  push it hard marsha doj must act this should include crooked hillary's illegal deletion of her emails speed  and we're not finished yet all coming together like a highly complex but beautiful puzzle  no riots and looting are just fine with concast  he's both  doj  i do  action must be taken  biden handlers know this is a lie  chicago‘s fraternal order of police endorses donald trump for reelection  via  beautiful evening in henderson nevada with great american patriots thank you   if you murder a police officer you should receive the death penalty  replied yes absolutely biden calls for abolishing cash bail and closing prisons  and biden even called law enforcement the enemy biden's anti-police crusade must stop furthermore the corporations funding anti-police organizations should instead give their money to the families of crime victims and fallen officers in the republican party we know that police officers are not villains but heroes who risk their lives to keep us safe 24/7/365 for the entire summer joe biden was silent as left-wing mobs assaulted police officers when biden's far-left supporters set fire to police cars precinct stations and courthouses joe biden called them peaceful protestors when asked if he would cut police funding biden our thoughts are with the two  sheriff deputies who were shot in los angeles we send our love and support to their families and we pray to god for their recovery  i was right these people were all wrong and now they criticize me such hypocrisy  and prices are coming down fast also just ended all rebates to middlemen further reducing prices just signed a new executive order to lower drug prices my most favored nation order will ensure that our country gets the same low price big pharma gives to other countries the days of global freeriding at america's expense are over sleepy joe biden has spent 47 years in politics being terrible to hispanics now he is relying on castro lover bernie sanders to help him out that won't work remember miami cubans gave me the highly honored bay of pigs award for all i have done for our great cuban population they just don't get it  actually falling very steadily and fast deaths and hospitalizations way down and even cases down despite far more testing than any other country in the world by far india second  but people don't want to get mugged beaten up or killed let new york's finest who proudly endorsed me do their job rehire crime squad and fired police they will bring safety back to nyc fast  in the highly competitive world of high tech how come nobody has ever challenged mini mike bloomberg and his very average  supposedly outdated stuff that he sells to so many did he use his position as mayor of new york to create what is now a monopoly just askin' i thought mini mike was through with democrat politics after spending almost 2 billion dollars and then giving the worst and most inept debate performance in the history of presidential politics pocahontas ended his political career on first question over save nyc instead  if they die fast trial death penalty for the killer only way to stop this  such an honor drudge is down 40percent plus since he became fake news most importantly he's bleeding profusely and is no longer hot but others are lost all trumpers  animals that must be hit hard  i am running for re-election to bring prosperity to nevada to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to americanot china if we win america wins if biden wins china wins if biden wins the rioters anarchists and arsonists win vote  i did more in 47 months as president than sleepy joe biden did in 47 years   the far-left maniacs supporting joe biden are burning flags and chanting america was never great but we know the truth america is the most exceptional nation on earth and our destiny is blessed by god joe biden cannot lead our country because he does not believe in our country at biden's convention they decried america as a wicked sinful nation destined for a fate of doom and despair they even removed the words under god from the pledge of allegiance  twice thank you nevada    just landed in nevada but while on air force one watched most vicious tv commercial i have ever seen pathetic joe's people placed an unsourced ad where they have me saying unthinkable things about soldiers while standing over their graves it is a made up lie a total con job just landed see you soon minden nevada make

has now been determined that the mueller scam should never have been set up in the first place there were no grounds it was all an illegitimate witch hunt  a big price must be paid how different my life would have been if this fraud on america was never committed alert so now we find out that the entire mueller hit squad illegally wiped their phones clean just prior to the investigation of them

his incompetence thank you michele  my administration will do everything in its power to prevent weak mayors and lawless cities from taking federal dollars while they let anarchists harm people burn

saying the opposite this is what we're up against lies but we will win the beauty parlor owner must really dislike crazy nancy pelosi turning her in on tape is a really big deal she probably treats him like she treats everyone elseand she strongly supported a kennedy who just lost in of all places massachusetts joe biden is a low energy candidate the likes of which we have never seen before the last thing our country needs is a low energy individual especially when surrounded by high energy chess players scattered all over the world he's back in his basement now no schedule crazy nancy pelosi is being decimated for having a beauty parlor opened when all others are closed and for not wearing a mask despite constantly lecturing everyone else we will almost certainly take back the house and send nancy packing seriously is this what our great usa wants as its leader  joe biden is a low energy candidate the likes of which we have never seen before the last thing our country needs is a low energy individulal especially when surrounded by high energy chess players scattered all over the world he's back in his basement now no schedule joe biden is not on the side of law enforcement and that was spectacularly evident on my very successful trip yesterday to kenosha we solved the problem quickly and it was very much appreciated by the people of wisconsin joe biden wouldn't know where to begin a bad record rigged election  the unsolicited ballots scam is their only hope will be the most corrupt election in history by far  some things just don't get any crazier

party taxes up big no 2a biden has completely lost control pelosi strongly backed the loser  we catch them all  like fredo at fake news  the very untalented joy reid should be fired for this horrible use of the words muslim terrorists such xenophobia and racism on msdnc anyone else would be gone and fast  will fredo be fired by fake news  he speaks with great disrespect about women and it will only get worse fredo's ratings are bad so this is the time always terrible to speak to sleazebags especially when you are being recorded cnn has no choice fredo must go  mike pence was never put on standby  there were no mini-strokes this is just more fake news by  a phony story the reason for the visit to walter reed together with the full press pool was to complete my yearly physical short

tds  not even a minor one thank you  true  drudge didn't support me in 2016 and i hear he doesn't support me now maybe that's why he is doing poorly his fake news report on mini-strokes is incorrect

of india as they grieve the loss of a great leader had a very productive conversation with kevin warren commissioner of the big ten conference about immediately starting up big ten football would be good great for everyone players fans country on the one yard line heading to kenosha wisconsin to thank law enforcement and the national guard for a job well done the violence stopped six days ago the moment the guard entered the picture thank you it never ends now they are trying to say that your favorite president me went to walter reed medical center having suffered a series of mini-strokes

highly political  basketball ratings are way down and they won't be coming back i hope football and baseball are watching and learning because the same thing will be happening to them stand tall for

laura ingraham  tonight at 10:00 pm eastern on  enjoy just watched what biden had to say to me he's blaming the police far more than he's blaming the rioters anarchists agitators and looters which he could never blame or he would lose the radical left bernie supports law  order the radical left mayors   governors of cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their movement it wasn't supposed to be like this but the anarchists  agitators got carried away and don't listen anymore even forced slow joe out of basement i've been getting really good polls some over 50percent except for one fake poll done by  news which gives no information about the sample r or d or anything else they did this last election with one week to go down 12 points and i won they are disgusting fake news portland is a mess and it has been for many years if this joke of a mayor doesn't clean it up we will go in and do it for them if i didn't insist on having the national guard activate and go into kenosha wisconsin there would be no kenosha right now also there would have been great death and injury i want to thank law enforcement and the national guard i will see you on tuesday just had a wonderful conversation with my friend prime minister  of japan who will be leaving office soon shinzo will soon be recognized as the greatest prime minister in the history of japan whose relationship with the usa is the best it has ever been special man when is slow joe biden going to criticize the anarchists thugs  agitators in antifa when is he going to suggest bringing up the national guard in badly run  crime infested democrat cities  states remember he can't lose the crazy bernie super liberal vote his problem is interesting he must always be weak on crime because of the bernie sanders radical left voter if he loses them like crooked hillary did he is toast and many will vote for me because of trade bernie was good on trade joe must always be weak on crime joe biden is coming out of the basement earlier than his hoped for ten days because his people told him he has no choice his poll numbers are plunging going to pittsburgh where i have helped industry to a record last year  then back to his  basement for an extended period rushing him out of basement after seeing some very disturbing numbers don't worry he'll go back to basement soon  rest in peace jay  a weak and pathetic democrat mayor  the only way you will stop the violence in the high crime democrat run cities is through strength he tried mixing with the agitators and anarchists and they mocked him he would like to blame me and the federal government for going in but he hasn't seen anything yet we have only been there with a small group to defend our us courthouse because he couldn't do it ted wheeler the wacky radical left do nothing democrat mayor of portland who has watched great death and destruction of his city during his tenure thinks this lawless situation should go on forever wrong portland will never recover with a fool for a mayor the people of portland like all other cities   parts of our great country want law  order the radical left democrat mayors like the dummy

patriots  disgraceful anarchists we are watching them closely but stupidly protected by the radical left dems  democrat leadership has no clue request help nowproblem over  antifa is a radical left group that only wants bad things for our country they are supported by $fools  wheeler is incompetent much like sleepy joe biden this is not what our great country wants they want safety  security and do not want to defund our police  our great national guard could solve these problems in less than 1 hour local authorities must ask before it is too late people of portland and other democrat run cities are disgusted with schumer pelosi and thier local leaders they want law  order  the big backlash going on in portland cannot be unexpected after 95 days of watching and incompetent mayor admit that he has no idea what he is doing the people of portland won't put up with no safety any longerthe mayor is a fool bring in the national guard  everything a governor asked the federal government for with respect to the pandemic they got they all said on tape the federal government did a great job governor cuomo used the word phenomenal the task force worked well with the states feds bailed

it's dumb warmongers like john bolton social pretenders like bob woodward who never has anything good to say or an unstable niece who was now rightfully shunned scorned and mocked her entire life and never even liked by her own very kind  caring grandfather about the only way a person is able to write a book on me is if they agree that it will contain as much bad stuff as possible much of which is lies it's like getting a job with cnn or msdnc and saying that president trump is great you have zero chance fake news i saved the iron range from the obama closure we opened it up again proudly also

of 2016 wow despite the democrats views across tv and online lie con we had 1479 million the republican national convention blew the democrat national convention  away not even close just like their lies on russia football play and everything else november 3rd the democrats see chaos as their way while president trump sees the rule of law mayor  thank you ken kenosha has been very quiet for the third night in a row or since the national guard has shown up that's the way it works it's all very simple portland with a very ungifted mayor should request help from the federal government if lives are endangered we're going in disgraceful that big ten is not playing football let them play how does the fake news not include online streaming numbers where republicans blow the dem numbers away great total numbers for the republican national convention blows democrat national convention away also much bigger fund raising numbers if the incompetent mayor of portland ted wheeler doesn't get control of his city and stop the anarchists agitators rioters and looters causing great danger to innocent people we will go in and take care of matters the way they should have been taken care of 100 days ago leading in michigan leading in minnesota leading all over sorry  thank you new hampshire   landing in new hampshire no i want big ten and all other football back now the dems don't want

authorities the federal government will act and quickly succeed are you listening portland succes since the national guard moved into kenosha wisconsin two days ago there has been no further violence not even a small problem when legally asked to help by local authorities the federal government will act and quickly succeed are you listening portland great ratings  reviews last night thank you democrats hate that i called for big pharma to match the lowest prescription drug prices in the world by using a favored nations clause prices will plunge democrats and biden didn't even mention the anarchists agitators looters and so called peaceful protesters at their convention they will allow rampant crime just as they do in portland if they ask us as they must do we will end crime in their democrat run cities fast the ten most dangerous cities in the us are all run by democrats and this has gone on for decades today i will be sending federal law enforcement and the national guard to kenosha wi to restore law and order we will not stand for looting arson violence and lawlessness on american streets my team just got off the phone with governor evers who agreed to accept federal assistance portland should do the same hurricane laura is a very dangerous and rapidly intensifying hurricane my administration remains fully engaged with state  local emergency managers to continue preparing and assisting the great people texas louisiana and arkansas listen to local officials we are with you  just in chinese state media and leaders of china want biden to win the us election  if this happened which it won't china would own our country and our record setting stock markets would literally crash governor should call in the national guard in wisconsin it is ready willing and more than able end problem fast 80 million unsolicited ballots are impossible for election centers to tabulate accurately the democrats know this better than anyone else the fraud and abuse will be an embarrassment to our country hopefully the courts will stop this scam they must stop calling these anarchists and agitators peaceful protestors come back into the real world the federal government is ready to end this problem immediately upon your request we again request kate brown  the governor of oregon and mayor  of portland to call up the national guard like should have been done 3 months ago i am pleased to inform the american public that acting secretary chad wolf will be nominated to be the secretary of homeland security chad has done an outstanding job and we greatly appreciate his service more jobs from eastport cutler  jonesport to stonington friendship and casco bay i am proud to help the great people of maine beautiful maine lobsters will now move tariff-free to europe for first time in many years great new deal by ustr levels playing field with canada millions of $'s more in exports for our country to be sending 80 million unsolicited ballots is very unfair and a roadmap to disaster even recent small and easier to control elections which did this are a catastrophic disaster fraudulent  missing ballots like never seen before 20percent and 30percent off stop very appreciative that  covered the vast majority of the republican convention last night that was really good for cnn while at the same time being good for our country thank you thank you   thank you to  for this evenings opening prayer  promises made promises kept   joe biden has said he would lock down the country again that's crazy we're having record job growth and a booming stock market but joe would end it all and close it all down ridiculous exclusive eyewitness says as many as 20000 unverified absentee ballots counted in detroit primary  via  god bless the usa  all the radical left democrats are trying to do with the post office hearings is blame the republicans for the fraud that will occur because of the 51 million ballots that are being sent to people who have not even requested them they are setting the table for a big mess incredible that   msdnc aren't covering the roll call of states fake news this is what the republican party is up against also i'd like to hear the remarks of the delegates from individual states rather than  anchors ridiculous continued  please watch highly respected dr harvey risch of yale on hydroxychloroquine  the greatest election fraud in our history is about to happen this may top the democrats illegally spying on my campaign  watch mark levin on air now great  actually i think i'm leading in the polls    chris wallace forgot to ask a very weak and pathetic schumer puppet senator chrisie coons why biden fought me when i put an extremely early ban on people coming into our country from heavily infected china biden later admitted i was right but why no question next we'll turn to people of the biden inner circle said by chris wallace of  after unsuccessfully grilling mark meadows then all softball questions to a group of biden lightweights including senator chris coons of delaware important white house news conference at 5:30 sharp today very good news happy sunday we want god   two democrat caucus meetings removed under god from the pledge of allegiance it sounded not only strange but terrible that's where they're coming from these riots are an antigovernment movement from the left that are all in democrat run cities the mayors have got to let their police do what they know how to do would be very easy to suppress or call in the federal government we will solve problem fast  so now the democrats are using mail drop boxes which are a voter security disaster among other things they make it possible for a person to vote multiple times also who controls them are they placed in republican or democrat areas they are not covid sanitized a big fraud now they're trying to deny this but they can't   wrote a great new book the trump century how our president changed the course of history forever strongly recommendeda special guy  a favored nations clause against big pharma which i signed last week means that the usa gets a price on prescription drugs that matches the price of the country that pays the lowest price anywhere in the world 50percent 60percent maybe 70percent reduction no other president would do this will be interviewed by  on  9:00 pm sunday night enjoy despite biggest ever job gains and a v shaped recovery joe biden said i would shut it down referring to our country he has no clue terrible  we did criminal justice reform without many politically motivated democrats the black  hispanic community will remember this on november 3rd  that they are trying to pull off in violation of everything that our country stands for vote no to the pelosi/ schumer money wasting hoax which is taking place now then fight the $51 million unasked for ballots only absentee ballots are acceptable representatives of the post office have repeatedly stated that they do not need money and will not make changes this is all another hoax by the democrats to give 25 billion unneeded dollars for political purposes  without talking about the universal mail-in ballot scam in new jersey they want you to certify that you asked for the universal mail-in ballot that they sent you but you never asked for it disaster in the wings many doctors and studies disagree with this  the deep state or whoever over at the fda is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics obviously they are hoping to delay the answer until after november 3rd must focus on speed and saving lives  why would suburban women vote for biden and the democrats when democrat run cities are now rampant with crime and they aren't asking the federal government for help which could easily spread to the suburbs and they will reconstitute on steroids their low income suburbs plan biden and the democrats have greatly disrespected the great state of wisconsin by not even paying a small visit to milwaukee the designated site of the dnc the state  city worked very hard to make sure things would be good not nice vote trump wisconsin the democrats took the word god out of the pledge of allegiance at the democrat national convention at first i thought they made a mistake but it wasn't it was done on purpose remember evangelical christians and all this is where they are coming from-it's done vote nov 3 another bad night of rioting in portland oregon a small number of federal troops there to protect courthouse and other federal property only great job wanting to be asked by city  state to stop the riots would bring in national guard end problem immediately ask robert i love you rest in peace in 47 years joe did none of the things of which he now speaks he will never change just words 96percent approval rating in the republican party 51percent approval rating overall in the rasmussen poll thank you after the worst debate performance in the history of politics michael bloomberg commonly known as mini mike is trying to make a comeback by begging the democrats for relevance they treated him like a dog and always will before politics he said great things about me 96percent approval rating in the republican party 51percent approval rating overal in the rasmussen poll thank you will be interviewed by  tonight at 9:00 pm enjoy   to get into the democrat national convention you must have an id card with a pictureyet the democrats refuse to do this when it come to your very important vote gee i wonder why they are sending out 51000000 ballots to people who haven't even requested a ballot many of those people don't even exist they are trying to steal this election this should not be allowed the democrats are demanding mail-in ballots because the enthusiasm meter for slow joe biden is the lowest in recorded history and they are concerned that very few people will turn out to vote instead they will search  find people then harvest  return ballots not fair america first   i stand for law and order and i took action operation legend has led to the arrest of over 1000 criminals including 90 killers all while sleepy joe biden and the radical left excuses violence and crime in their democrat-run cities i want safety  security joe allows crime thank you pennsylvania   make america great again  thank you   thank you   thank you donna   thank you   thank you so much  they would own our country  it's never a real twitter trending it's twitter executive's choice only negative on republican voices especially mine sarah is correct mccain was a lousy candidate with lots of bad policy but the deadheads sabotaged his campaign from the inside and never gave him a chance to win hope they were happy with obiden who gave you me  my great honor  but didn't she call him a racist didn't she say he was incompetent why did he refuse to endorse slow joe until it was all over and even then was very late why did he try to get him not to run he spied on my campaign and got caught i live in new york even the most liberal friends that i have are thinking twice about voting democrat this time because they've seen what's happened to the city under  de blasio and the state under  they're getting eaten up by taxes  welcome barack and crooked hillary see you on the field of battle  will be having a press conference at 5:45 pm see you in 15 minutes will he having a press conference at 5:45 pm see you in 15 minutes why are republicans allowing the democrats to have ridiculous post office hearings on saturday  monday just before and during our convention let them hold them now during their convention or after our convention is over always playing right into their hands  don't buy goodyear tires they announced a ban on maga hats get better tires for far less this is what the radical left democrats do two can play the same game and we have to start playing it now with what i am doing in the fight with the drug companies drug prices will be coming down 50 60 and even 70 per cent the democrats are fighting hard to stop me with big ad buys plus likewise big pharma favored nations and rebates are bringing prices down now we will win if you can protest in person you can vote in person senate intelligence panel found absolutely no evidence of collusion there was no evidence that the trump campaign conspired with the russian government to influence 2016 affirming the findings of other investigations daily caller big win matt  she was a terrible ag was she the leaker  great going laura you have a great chance against a pelosi puppet  kimberly will work with the trump administration and we will bring baltimore back and fast don't blow it baltimore the democrats have destroyed your city  great win anna watched your race from beginning very impressed your next opponent charlie crist is a pelosi puppet who is bad on crime our military vets  2nd amendment you have my complete  total endorsement  tell the dems that we have more cases because we do far more testing than any other country  and others in that business should be charged by the us postal system much more per package and the post office would be immediately brought back to good health now vibrant with all jobs saved no pass on to customers get it done meanwhile i gave america energy independence in fact so much energy we could never use it all the bernie/biden/aoc green new deal plan would take california's failed policies to every american in california democrats have intentionally implemented rolling blackouts  forcing americans in the dark democrats are unable to keep up with energy demand the democrats have to start enforcing law and order in their cities and states new york city chicago and portland are a total disaster people forget how divided our country was under obamabiden the anger and hatred were unbelievable they shouldn't be lecturing to us i'm here as your president because of them a horrible governor crime is taking over nyc  state everyone is leaving he is after the nra they should move to texas or elsewhere and must get tough cuomo killed 11000 people in nursing homes alone crooked  incompetent  john kasich did a bad job in ohio ran for president and was easy to beat and now went to the other side desperate for relevance good job by chris c in exposing yet another loser  many thousands of people work for our government with that said a former disgruntled employee named miles taylor who i do not know never heard of him said he left  is on the open arms fake news circuit said to be a real stiff they will take anyone against us the obamabiden administration was the most corrupt in history including the fact that they got caught spying on my campaign the biggest political scandal in the history of our country it's called treason and more thanks for your very kind words michelle looking back into history the response by the obamabiden team to the h1n1 swine flu was considered a weak and pathetic one check out the polling it's really bad the big difference is that they got a free pass from the corrupt fake news media my administration and i built the greatest economy in history of any country turned it off saved millions of lives and now am building an even greater economy than it was before jobs are flowing nasdaq is already at a record high the rest to follow sit back  watch somebody please explain to  that donald j trump would not be here in the beautiful white house if it weren't for the job done by your husband barack obama biden was merely an afterthought a good reason for that very late   unenthusiastic endorsement thank you will never let you down  now ap estimates that the real cuomo number of people killed because of his total incompetence is 11000 not the 6000 that was originally thought cuomo just like his brother fredo has not got a very good memory  a proposal by pentagon officials to slash military healthcare by $22 billion dollars has been firmly and totally rejected by me we will do nothing to hurt our great military professionals  heroes as long as i am your president thank you she was fired because she was boring and never had what it took perhaps that has proven to be a mistake  why would  put on phony congresswoman  a total waste of airtime new record for nasdaq save the post office why is congress scheduled to meet on post office next monday during the republican convention rather than now while the dems are having their convention they are always playing games get tough republicans great division between the bernie sanders crowd and the other radical lefties our country would be destroyed just landed in mankato minnesota just approved and fast the full emergency declaration for the great state of iowa they got hit hard by record setting winds thank you to   and governor kim reynolds what's with  polls increasing me by 10 points in a short period of time maybe they want to take over from  getting ready to land in minneapolis our great national guard saved the city from further destruction should have been called up sooner by local government the us post office system has been failing for many decades we simply want to make the post office great again while at the same time saving billions of dollars a year for american taxpayers dems don't have a clue  some states use drop boxes for the collection of universal mail-in ballots so who is going to collect the ballots and what might be done to them prior to tabulation a rigged election so bad for our country only absentee ballots acceptable will be interviewed on  this morning at 8:00 am enjoy great going jim proud of you  law and order if  can't do it we will  thank you franklin  thank you james  if carefully done according to the guidelines there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to do that vote at polling place doctor anthony fauci  is not watchable during weekend afternoons it is worse than fake news  i strongly suggest turning your dial to  they do a really fair  balanced job voter scam  the honorable thing to do is drop the mail-in scam before it is too late absentee ballots like they have in florida are good  news conference at 5:30 pm enjoy if obama did this they would speak of nothing else biden could never do it  thank you  would be terrible for our country  more fake news  fake

has my complete and total endorsement will be a big win on november 3rd this is not the opponent the democrats wanted  there is tremendous lawlessness in america's liberal cities would be so easy to

flames outside the city's federal courthouse the past few days have seen the violence subside dramatically what happened william mcgurn  i am deeply saddened by the tragic loss of eight marines and

the roads and highways thousands and thousands even bigger by far than the crowds of 2016 saw no biden supporters and yet some in the fake news said it was an equal number sad record high nasdaq it would all come crashing down including your jobs stocks and 401k's if sleepy joe ever became president china and others would own us so crazy nancy pelosi said horrible things about dr deborah birx going after her because she was too positive on the very good job we are doing on combatting the china virus including vaccines  therapeutics in order to counter nancy deborah took the bait  hit us pathetic wow really bad tv ratings for morning joe   doing great leading all others by far  not a factor my visits last week to texas and frorida had massive numbers of cheering people gathered along

republicans to win the state post office could never handle the traffic of mail-in votes without preparation using covid to steal the state see you in court  and ruined the federal government must again seek the death penalty in a do-over of that chapter of the original trial our country cannot let the appellate decision stand also it is ridiculous that this process is taking so long rarely has anybody deserved the death penalty more than the boston bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev the court agreed that this was one of the worst domestic terrorist attacks since the 9/11 atrocities yet the appellate court tossed out the death sentence so many lives lost astronauts complete first splashdown in 45 years very exciting great to have nasa astronauts return to earth after very successful two month

hasn't for many years never got the trump thing she plays right into the hands of the stupid people payroll tax cut plus dollars jake this wasn't a trump rally but rather a very successful gathering of the great sheriffs and law enforcement of florida who gave me their unequivocal endorsement no defund the police here best wishes  wrong we have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country 60000000 if we tested less there would be less cases how did italy france  spain do now europe sadly has flare ups most of our governors worked hard  smart we will come back strong  :  homeland security is not leaving portland until local police complete cleanup of anarchists and agitators obama worked harder for hillary clinton and the losing clinton campaign than she worked for herself now he's working with sleepy joe will be same result maga is energized like never before we have more cases because we do more testing it's lamestream media gold we beat obama 4 years ago he worked harder than crooked hillary and we'll do it again  i'm with you all the way thank you  i am thrilled to be back in my home state of floridaand honored to receive the endorsement of dozens of incredible florida sheriffs thank you   the democrats are holding back the $1200 to $3400 family of four checks that were ready to be sent out very disappointed in  for blocking the temporary extension of the $600 unemployment benefits the do nothing democrats are more interested in playing politics than in helping our deserving people drain the swamp on november 3rd pelosi  schumer blocked desperately needed unemployment payments which is so terrible especially since they fully understand that it was not the workers fault that they are unemployed it's the fault of china pelosi  schumer have no interest in making a deal that is good for our country and our people all they want is a trillion dollars and much more for their radical left governed states most of which are doing

loves our country we need him badly in washington he has my complete and total endorsement  we just got 50percent in rasmussen and much higher in our internal polls we are doing a new ad campaign on sleepy joe biden that will be out on monday he has been brought even further left than crazy bernie sanders ever thought possible by the way bernie's people love me on trade great job by jim jordan and also some very good statements by tony fauci big progress being made  our massive testing capability rather than being praised is used by the lamestream media and their partner the do nothing radical left democrats as a point of scorn this testing and what we have so quickly done is used as a fake news weapon sad somebody please tell congressman clyburn who doesn't have a clue that the chart he put up indicating more cases for the us than europe is because we do much more testing than any other country in the world if we had no testing or bad testing we would show very few cases great to spend time with mike singletary while going to texas he's one of the greatest football players ever  a strong man and a really good person great being with you mike  my administration has

crossings go down this past week we built over 10 miles of wall at our southern border we now have 256 miles of new wall and we are on track to have 300 miles completed by the end of august  we are going to win the 2020 election big  must know election results on the night of the election not days months or even years later glad i was able to get the very dishonest lamestream media to finally start talking about the risks to our democracy from dangerous universal mail-in-voting not absentee voting which i totally support the phone with his amazing wife gloria daughter melanie and son vincent to express my deepest condolences to the entire family  melania and i loved herman cain a great man herman rest in peace  my friend herman cain a powerful voice of freedom and all that is good passed away this morning herman had an incredible career and was adored by everyone that ever met him especially me he was a very special man an american patriot and great friend i just got off support patio pizza and its wonderful owner guy caligiuri in st james long island ny great pizza  drug prices will soon be lowered massively big pharma drug companies are advertising against me like crazy because lower prices mean less profit when you watch a fake ad just think lower drug prices kate brown governor of oregon isn't doing her job she must clear out and in some cases arrest the anarchists  agitators in portland if she can't do it the federal government will do it for her we will not be leaving until there is safety with universal mail-in voting not absentee voting which is good 2020 will be the most inaccurate  fraudulent election in history it will be a great embarrassment to the usa delay the election until people can properly securely and safely vote major china virus flare ups in many of the countries that the fake news was touting as doing so well some of these countries are now a disaster lamestream media doesn't want to report this also highly inaccurate numbers being reported by many other countries  mail-in voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster even testing areas are way off the dems talk of foreign influence in voting but they know that mail-in voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race even beyond that there's no accurate count germany pays russia billions of dollars a year for energy and we are supposed to protect germany from russia what's that all about also germany is very delinquent in their 2percent fee to nato we are therefore moving some troops out of germany check out this mail-in voting experiment by a local news station   new york mail-in voting is in a disastrous state of condition votes from many weeks ago are missing a total mess they have no idea what is going on rigged election i told you so same thing would happen but on massive scale with usa fake news refuses to report  reported incorrectly what the federal government is doing with respect to portland we are demanding that the governor  mayor do their job or we will do it for them to complicated to discuss in a tweet but bad reporting by fox possibly on purpose  great to be in texas do not stop the crime and violence from the anarchists and agitators immediately the federal government will go in and do the job that local law enforcement was supposed to do if the federal government and its brilliant law enforcement homeland didn't go into portland one week ago there would be no portland -- it would be burned and beaten to the ground if the mayor and governor just landed in the great state of texas  i was on air force one flying to the great state of texas where i just landed it is amazing in watching  how different they are from four years ago not even watchable they totally forgot who got them where they are with biden drug prices will quadruple after many years the game is finally up for big pharma and they're not happy about it please understand that when you see their negative ads the drug companies are spending millions of dollars in advertising against me only because i am lowering drug prices massively 50percent and more biden and obama said they would do this for eight years but never did your housing prices will go up based on the market and crime will go down i have rescinded the obama-biden affh rule enjoy i am happy to inform all of the people living their suburban lifestyle dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood if congress doesn't bring fairness to big tech which they should have done years ago i will do it myself with executive orders in washington it has been all talk and no action for years and the people of our country are sick and tired of it reno-stead airport has big bucks coming its way i'm designating over $48 million from  to reconstruct the airport's taxiway and ramp this along with 4 other airport grants to nevada will help in the economic recovery and growth of the state i am in  flying to the great state of texas it is amazing in watching  how different they are from four years ago not even watchable they totally forgot who got them where they are big

regional airport has a major grant coming its way from  i'm designating $36 million to reconstruct its terminal building in addition to 5 more airport grants around the state glad to help the people of arkansas law  order sleepy joe biden is just a trojan horse for the radical left agenda he will do whatever they want the plus self-help for people who hate self-help by the very smart and witty  is on sale now it is great canceling cancel culture make his book as successful as his tv show buy it now great going to a very talented group  vote these people out they are crazy    be able to produce what i have so when you see those nasty ads from big pharma remember the only reason they are going all out is the massive price reductions you are getting not good for them plus i was only president in 51 years that got a prescription d reduction big pharma is taking television ads trying to make the case that i am raising prescription drug prices on seniors the ad is a lie what i have done will lead to a 50percent reduction in prices at least  big pharma is not happy about it no other president would nadler calls antifa violence a myth   they are anarchists with miles of tape showing their illegal activity jerry blame it on russia russia russia would destroy our american cities and worse if sleepy joe biden the puppet of the left ever won markets would crash and cities would burn our country would suffer like never before we will beat the virus soon and go on to the golden age better than ever before the fake news media is trying to portray the portland and seattle protesters as wonderful sweet and innocent people just out for a little stroll actually they are sick and deranged anarchists  agitators who our great men  women of law enforcement easily control but who make america great again so disgusting to watch twitter's so-called trending where sooo many trends are about me and never a good one they look for anything they can find make it as bad as possible and blow it up trying to make it trend really ridiculous illegal and of course very unfair anarchists agitators or protestors who vandalize or damage our federal courthouse in portland or any federal buildings in any of our cities or states will be prosecuted under our recently re-enacted statues  monuments act minimum ten years in prison don't do it  homeland security or federal forces are little involved in seattle other than we have a large standby team in case of emergency the media is calling that one wrong also in portland we are protecting federal property including the courthouse which wouldn't last a day rigged election and everyone knows it  where is justice  wow  he is and people are not happy about it the washington post is a political front for amazon nobody treated ronald reagan worse  nice  we do more testing than any country in the world by far over 55 million tests fake news  says we should do more testing but even if we did 100 times more they would then say it is still not enough they are totally discredited just want sleepy joe to win in november  the protesters are actually anarchists who hate our country the line of innocent mothers were a scam that lamestream refuses to acknowledge just like they don't report the violence of these demonstrations  the 2020 election will be totally rigged if mail-in voting is allowed to take place  everyone knows it so much time is taken talking about foreign influence but the same people won't even discuss mail-in election corruption look at patterson nj 20percent of vote was corrupted because of my strong focus on the china virus including scheduled meetings on vaccines our economy and much else i won't be able to be in new york to throw out the opening pitch for the  on august 15th we will make it later in the season the lamestream media including  which has really checked out is refusing to show what is really going on in portland seattle and other places they want the american public to believe that these are just some wonderful protesters not radical left anarchists there is no way a place like pennsylvania can vote for the radical left and their puppet joe biden when they are against fracking steel production and just about everything else that pennsylvania stands for likewise texas and many other states so the washington post is running the reagan foundation and rino paul ryan is on the board of fox which has been terrible we will win anyway even with the phony  suppression polls which have been seriously wrong for 5 years  the trump campaign has more enthusiasm according to many than any campaign in the history of our great country even more than 2016 biden has none the silent majority will speak on november third fake suppression polls  fake news will not save the radical left crazy nancy pelosi said i made a mistake when i banned people from infected china from entering the us in january tens of thousands of lives were saved as she danced in the streets of chinatown sf in late february biden agreed with her but soon admitted that i was right brett loves wisconsin mississippi and minnesota a good golfer hits it long  this week you had joe biden call arizona a city nothing matters with him however because the opposition party lamestream media covers everything up especially the corruption the obama/biden administration is the most corrupt in history they even spied on my campaign thank you jon  my administration is closely monitoring hurricane douglas off hawaii  hurricane hanna which has now made landfall in texas we continue to coordinate closely with both states  listen to your emergency management officials    to protect your family  property  and to joy his wonderful wife who he loved so much my warmest condolences one of the greats in the history of television regis philbin has passed on to even greater airwaves at 88 he was a fantastic person and my friend he kept telling me to run for president holds the record for most live television and he did it well regis we love you  many democrats are leaving the party over calls to defund the police    great going brandon you really get it the democrats in the house are trying to undo my big win travel ban bill which successfully keeps very bad and dangerous people out of our great country passed along party lines hopefully will be dead in the senate the dems have gone stone cold left venezuela on steroids wow  to virtual pennies epi-pens went from their incredibly high jacked up prices to lower than their original give away bargains biggest price reductions in history by far nothing like this has ever for our citizens especially our seniors remember your favorite president yesterday i signed four measures that will massively reduce the prices of prescription drugs in many cases by more than 50percent nothing like this has ever been done before because big pharma with its vast power would not let it happen expensive insulin went from big dollars congratulations jim it was a great and beautiful event well deserved  wow win in 2020  so obama and his team of lowlifes spied on my campaign and got caught open and shut case more papers released today which are devastating to them will they ever pay the price the political crime of the century 96percent approval rating in the republican party thank you congratulations    i spoke to highly respected chairman senator  who has informed me that he will not be changing the names of our great military bases and forts places from which we won two world wars and more like me jim is not a believer in cancel culture great job by  in agreeing to build in texas what is expected to be the largest auto plant anywhere in the world he kept his word to me texas   are big winners made in the usa the great jim ryun will be honored this morning at the white house with the presentation of the presidential medal of freedom congratulations to jim and the entire ryun family 11:00 am    will be interviewed by  tonight at 9:00 pm on  enjoy welcome back baseball  white house press conference at 5:15 pm live the suburban housewives of america must read this article biden will destroy your neighborhood and your american dream i will preserve it and make it even better  obama who wouldn't even endorse biden until everyone else was out of the primaries and even then waited a long time is now making a commercial of support remember i wouldn't even be here if it weren't for them i wouldn't be president they did a terrible job the democrats have stated strongly that they won't approve a payroll tax cut too bad it would be great for workers the republicans therefore didn't want to ask for it dems as usual are hurting the working men and women of our country recently watched failed rino tom ridge former head of homeland security trying to justify his sudden love of the radical left mayor of portland who last night was booed  shouted out of existence by the agitators  anarchists love watching pathetic never trumpers squirm we did great things but it doesn't matter to the dems  john bolton is with the exception of hillary by far the worst offender of them all  great but did maga have anything to do with this great ratings success  liz cheney is only upset because i have been actively getting our great and beautiful country out of the ridiculous and costly endless wars i am also making our so-called allies pay tens of billions of dollars in delinquent military costs they must at least treat us fairly i am deeply saddened by the loss of my friend charles evers charles was a trail blazer in politics and a fearless leader alongside his brother medgar for civil rights  we must protect our national parks for our children and grandchildren i am calling on the house to pass the great american outdoors act today thanks  and  for all your work on this historic bill mail-in voting unless changed by the courts will lead to the most corrupt election in our nation's history  strong stock market numbers you want to see them dive vote for the radical left with their big tax hikes in my view general flynn should never have been prosecuted in the first place  judge andrew napolitano   you will never hear this on the fake news concerning the china virus but by comparison to most other countries who are suffering greatly we are doing very well and we have done things that few other countries could have done tremendous progress being made on vaccines and therapeutics looking forward to live sports but any time i witness a player kneeling during the national anthem a sign of great disrespect for our country and our flag the game is over for me thank you for the good reviews and comments on my interview with chris wallace of  we may have set a record for doing such an interview in the heat it was 100 degrees making things very interesting we are united in our effort to defeat the invisible china virus and many people say that it is patriotic to wear a face mask when you can't socially distance there is nobody more patriotic than me your favorite president  congratulations allen great job  so we catch obama  biden not to even mention the rest of their crew spying on my campaign and nothing happens i hope not if it were the other way around 50 years for treason never forget the radical left democrats who totally control biden will destroy our country as we know it unimaginably bad things would happen to america look at portland where the pols are just fine with 50 days of anarchy we sent in help look at new york chicago philadelphia no we are trying to help portland not hurt it their leadership has for months lost control of the anarchists and agitators they are missing in action we must protect federal property and our people these were not merely protesters these are the real deal make america great again oregon officials are running scared when it comes to portland m saddened to hear the news of civil rights hero john lewis passing melania and i send our prayers to he and his family great job tammy  corrupt joe biden wants to defund our police he may use different words but when you look at his pact with crazy bernie and other things that's what he wants to do it would destroy america tax returns she's a mess many books have been written about me some good some bad both happily and sadly there will be more to come

your children won't be safe in biden's america and neither will anyone else would be so great if the media would get the word out to the people in a fair and balanced way we will win anyway but they

spied on my campaign and got caughtbut nothing presidential harassment for the 1/100th time the reason we show so many cases compared to other countries that haven't done nearly as well as we have is that our testing is much bigger and better we have tested 40000000 people if we did 20000000 instead cases would be half etc not reported thank you    the silent majority is stronger than ever just watch congratulations to jeff  on a great primary run and big victory against a very tough opponent   economy and jobs are growing much faster than anyone except me expected job growth is biggest in history china virus mortality rate is among the lowest of any country shaping up for a good third quarter and a great next year nasdaq at new record high 401k's way up i disagree with  on their very tough  expensive guidelines for opening schools while they want them open they are asking schools to do very impractical things i will be meeting with them in germany denmark norway  sweden and many other countries schools are open with no problems the dems think it would be bad for them politically if us schools open before the november election but is important for the children  families may cut off funding if not open death rate from coronavirus is down tenfold we will miss great country rocker charlie daniels who passed away yesterday in hermitage tennessee my condolences to his wife hazel and their family charlie is in my thoughts and prayers i love his music  covid-19 china virus death rate plunges from peak in us a tenfold decrease in mortality the washington times   valerie richardson  we have the lowest mortality rate in the world the fake news should be reporting these most important of facts but they don't president trump champions american greatness in his mount rushmore speech   the highly respected henry ford health system just reported based on a large sampling that hydroxychloroquine cut the death rate in certain sick patients very significantly the dems disparaged it for political reasons me disgraceful act now    wall is moving fast in texas arizona new mexico and california great numbers at the southern border dems want people to just flow in they want very dangerous open borders  why does the lamestream fake news media refuse to say that china virus deaths are down 39percent and that we now have the lowest fatality mortality rate in the world they just can't stand that we are doing so well for our country why does the a lamestream fake news media refuse to say that china virus deaths are down 39percent and that we now have the lowest fatality mortality rate in the world they just can't stand that we are doing so well for our country corrupt joe biden and the democrats don't want to open schools in the fall for political reasons not for health reasons they think it will help them in november wrong the people get it the democrats would not have banned travel from heavily infected china especially so early therefore far more people would have died corrupt joe biden now admits this schools must open in the fall of 2541 patients hospitalized between march 10 and may 2 2020 across the system's six hospitals the study found 13percent of those treated with hydroxychloroquine alone died compared to 264percent not treated with hydroxychloroquine  treatment with hydroxychloroquine cut the death rate significantly in sick patients hospitalized with covid-19  and without heart-related side-effects according to a new study published by henry ford health system in a large-scale retrospective analysis breaking news the mortality rate for the china virus in the us is just about the lowest in the world also deaths in the us are way down a tenfold decrease since the pandemic height and our economy is coming back strong deaths from the china virus are down 39percent while our great testing program continues to lead the world by far why isn't the fake news reporting that deaths are way down it is only because they are indeed fake news they name teams out of strength not weakness but now the washington redskins  cleveland indians two fabled sports franchises look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct indians like elizabeth warren must be very angry right now nasdaq hits all time high this is no longer about peaceful protesting this is about angry violent criminal mobs taking over certain democrat run cities it is a lack of political leadership in that city chad wolf     new york city and chicago play the sanctuary city card where criminals are protected perhaps they will have to start changing their ways and thinking has  apologized to all of those great nascar drivers  officials who came to his aid stood by his side  were willing to sacrifice everything for him only to find out that the whole thing was just another hoax that  flag decision has caused lowest ratings ever china has caused great damage to the united states and the rest of the world if you want your 401k's  and stocks which are getting close to an all time high nasdaq is already there to disintegrate and disappear vote for the radical left do nothing democrats and corrupt joe biden massive tax hikes they will make you very poor fast statue of frederick douglass torn down in rochester  via  this shows that these anarchists have no bounds new china virus cases up because of massive testing deaths are down low and steady the fake news media should report this and also that new job numbers are setting records democrats want to defund  abolish police this despite poor crime numbers in cities that they run crazy chicago and new york city crime numbers are way up 67 people shot in chicago 13 killed shootings up significantly in nyc where people are demanding that    act now federal government ready willing and able to help if asked  weekend afternoons is the worst getting into  and msdnc territory watch    instead much better  gladly puts up the phony suppression polls as soon as they come out we are leading in the real polls because people are sick  tired of watching the democrat run cities in all cases falling apart also now 96percent approval rating in the republican party another 2016 wow  got caught cold manipulating the words and meaning of my 4th of july speech they were brazen desperate watch what happens on this wonderful day we celebrate our

big 4th of july air show soon coming down the east coast get ready to look up to the sky check local listings would lead to disaster  the fake news media is being laughed at all over the world  this would be the beginning of the end he has no clue but he wouldn't be calling the shots  and if the federal government wasn't getting ready to go in and we were all set it would still be a squatter's anarchist's mess  in a certain way our tremendous testing success gives the fake news media all they want cases in the meantime deaths and the all important mortality rate goes down you don't hear about that from the fake news and you never will anybody need any ventilators cases cases cases if we didn't test so much and so successfully we would have very few cases if you test 40000000 people you are going to have many cases that without the testing like other countries would not show up every night on the fake evening news change hearts not stones there is no end to historical purification great historian doug wead thank you my friend america loves india  great  the  is a very corrupt and dishonest media outlet that suffers tds at a level rarely seen they will lose any

another fabricated russia hoax maybe by the fake news  wanting to make republicans look bad  absentee ballots are fine a person has to go through a process to get and use them mail-in voting on the other hand will lead to the most corrupt election is usa history bad things happen with mail-ins just look at special election in patterson nj 19percent of ballots a fraud corrupt joe biden's team is running false ads almost everything in them is a knowing lie just the opposite of what they are saying  very much like their fake news partners the dems want to defund and abolish the police not good

stopped thank you corrupt joe biden has confirmed that he would give unlimited healthcare to illegal immigrants this would break our system and bring millions of people to the usa  funny to see corrupt joe biden reading a statement on russia which was obviously written by his handlers russia ate his and obama's lunch during their time in office so badly that obama wanted them out of the then g-8 us was weak on everything but especially russia thank you to the great people of the villages the radical left do nothing democrats will fall in the fall corrupt joe is shot see you soon  nobody's

an anonymous source by the fake news  everybody is denying it  there have not been many attacks on us corrupt joe biden said yesterday that we have over 120 million people dead of coronavirus obamacare is a joke deductible is far too high and the overall cost is ridiculous my administration has gone out of its way to manage oc much better than previous but it is still no good i will always protect people with pre-existing conditions always alwaysalways now that the very expensive unpopular and unfair individual mandate provision has been terminated by us many states  the us are asking the supreme court that obamacare itself be terminated so that it can be replaced with a far better and much less expensive alternative we will win the election against corrupt joe biden nancy pelosi and schumer we will save the supreme court your 2nd amendment permanent damage from the ridiculous green new deal and you from massive tax hikes also our heritage history and law  order do not believe

never been worse the lamestream media has gone crazy a  commentator just ripped me with lies with nobody defending they talked about the friendly protesters they set the church on fire the day before they were anything but friendly and how i stood and held the bible upside down it wasn't upside down  how trump is making black america great again the untold story of black advancement in the era of trump by horace cooper  a great new book it was my great honor to free up 5000 square miles of ocean off the coast of maine enjoy the good and the bad it is important for us to understand and remember even in turbulent and difficult times and learn from them knowledge comes from the most unusual of places very sad to see states allowing roving gangs of wise guys anarchists  looters many of them having no idea what they are doing indiscriminately ripping down our statues and monuments to the past some are great works of art but all represent our history  heritage both pres obama destroyed the lobster and fishing industry in maine now it's back bigger and better than anyone ever thought possible enjoy your lobstering and fishing make lots of money biden failed with china they took us to the cleaners i got $billions out of china and gave much of it to our targeted farmers law  order is james comey and his band of dirty cops going to apologize to general michael flynn and many others for

loyal and trusted member of the team that i know will do an outstanding job we must win this election follow him at  dr anthony fauci who is with us in all ways a very high 72percent approval rating so if he is in charge along with vp etc and with us doing all of these really good things why doesn't the lamestream media treat us as they should answer because they are fake news we did a great job on coronavirus including the very early ban on china ventilator production and testing which is by far the most and best in the world we saved millions of us lives yet the fake news refuses to acknowledge this in a positive way but they do give there will never be an autonomous zone in washington dc as long as i'm your president if they try they will be met with serious force cases are going up in the us because we are testing far more than any other country and ever expanding with smaller testing we would show fewer cases this action is taken effective immediately but may also be used retroactively for destruction or vandalism already caused there will be no exceptions i have authorized the federal government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument statue or other such federal property in the us with up to 10 years in prison per the veteran's memorial preservation act or such other laws that may be pertinent washed up creepster john bolton is a lowlife who should be in jail money seized for disseminating for profit highly classified information remember what they did to the young submarine sailor but did nothing to crooked hillary i ended up pardoning him it wasn't fair see bolton broke the law classified information  interesting guy bolton is really dumb  true and he broke the law  numerous people arrested in dc for the disgraceful vandalism in lafayette park of the magnificent statue of andrew jackson in addition to the exterior defacing of st john's church across the street 10 years in prison under the veteran's memorial preservation act beware looks what's going on here where are the protesters was this man arrested  so terrible  the china trade deal is fully intact hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the agreement i brought back cars  jobs will do it again for michigan  everywhere else  a really wonderful book buy it and enjoy  wow the trump rally gives  the largest saturday night audience in its hustory isn't it amazing that virtually nobody in the lamestream media is reporting this rather major feat rather hard to believe that  didn't know that the border wall is well under construction fully financed  already over 200 miles long will soon be finished they just reported that it is something that dems are unlikely to budge on in this election year   could somebody please explain to reporter doug mckelway of  that the border wall has long been under construction the battle war is won the dems have finally given in in fact i will be in arizona tomorrow to celebrate the 212th plus mile of completion  presidential harassment trump rally gives fox news largest saturday night audience in its history  senator jim inhofe  delivers for the state of oklahoma a us army

can go out and protest riot break into stores and create all sorts of havoc they can also go out and vote  and keep our election honest with millions of mail-in ballots being sent out who knows where they are going and to whom unlike the radical left i will always stand against socialism and with the people of venezuela my admin has always stood on the side of freedom and liberty and against the oppressive maduro regime i would only meet with maduro to discuss one thing a peaceful exit from power because of mail-in ballots 2020 will be the most rigged election in our nations history unless this stupidity is ended we voted during world war one  world war two with no problem but now they are using covid in order to cheat by using mail-ins i gave john bolton who was incapable of being senate confirmed because he was considered a wacko and was not liked a chance i always like hearing differing points of view he turned out to be grossly incompetent and a liar   see judge's opinion classified information rigged 2020 election millions of mail-in ballots will be printed by foreign countries and others it will be the scandal of our times barr mail-in ballots ‘absolutely opens the floodgates to fraud‘  via  this will be the election disaster of our time mail-in ballots will lead to a rigged election our coronavirus testing is so much greater 25 million tests and so much more advanced that it makes us look like we have more cases especially proportionally than other countries my message on that is very clear ridiculous don't do it  actually that would be a big improvement and she would win  his president trump's policies set a foundation that allowed us to survive the pandemic     true we built something so strong that we are now setting economic growth records again jobs  growth a democrat win in 2020 would be a tragic setback for african americans   the democrat house wants to pass a bill this week that will destroy our police republican congressmen  congresswomen will hopefully fight hard to defeat it we must protect and cherish our police they keep us safe republicans are the party of liberty equality and justice for all we are the party of abraham lincoln and the party of law and order  joe biden's record can be summed up as 4 decades of betrayal calamity and failure  he never did anything  the silent majority is stronger than ever before   bolton broke the law and has been called out and rebuked for so doing with a really big price to pay he likes dropping bombs on people and killing them now he will have bombs dropped on him big court win against bolton obviously with the book already given out and leaked to many people and the media nothing the highly respected judge could have done about stopping itbut strong  powerful statements  rulings on money  on breaking classification were made who was all washed up until i brought him back and gave him a chance broke the law by releasing classified information in massive amounts he must pay a very big price for this as others have before him this should never to happen again wow i finally agree with failed political consultant steve schmidt who called wacko john bolton a despicable man who failed in his duty to protect america also stated that he should never be allowed to serve in government again so true plain and simple john bolton watch live trump

life religous liberty etc  vote 2020 i will be releasing a new list of conservative supreme court justice nominees which may include some or many of those already on the list by september 1 2020 if given the opportunity i will only choose from this list as in the past a conservative supreme court justice as president of the united states i am asking for a legal solution on daca not a political one consistent with the rule of law the supreme court is not willing to give us one so now we have to start this process all over again the daca decision while a highly political one and seemingly not based on the law gives the president of the united states far more power than ever anticipated nevertheless i will only act in the best interests of the united states of america religious liberty among many other things are over and gone the recent supreme court decisions not only on daca sanctuary cities census and others tell you only one thing we need new justices of the supreme court if the radical left democrats assume power your second amendment right to life secure borders and do you get the impression that the supreme court doesn't like me these horrible  politically charged decisions coming out of the supreme court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves republicans or conservatives we need more justices or we will lose our 2nd amendment  everything else vote trump 2020 he didn't want bolton anywhere near him bolton's dumbest of all statements set us back very badly with north korea even now i asked him what the hell were you thinking he had no answer and just apologized that was early on i should have fired him right then  there when wacko john bolton went on deface the nation and so stupidly said that he looked at the libyan model for north korea all hell broke out kim jong un who we were getting along with very well went ballistic just like his missiles and rightfully so bolton's book which is getting terrible reviews is a compilation of lies and made up stories all intended to make me look bad many of the ridiculous statements he attributes to me were never made pure fiction just trying to get even for firing him like the sick puppy he is it's a terrible situation and i blame the leaders of those cities the president of the united states has fought through a lot of different things since he's been in office and to be honest with you he's done one hell of a job    seattle's chop is just the latest example of liberal democrat cities caving to lawlessness    is facing considerable backlash for

it comes to shutting down a state or city and its hard working tax paying citizens does anyone notice how little the radical left takeover of seattle is being discussed in the fake news media that is

respected pollster mclaughlin  associates to analyze todays cnn poll and others which i felt were fake based on the incredible enthusiasm we are receiving read analysis for yourself this is the same

hard to believe with this kind of political talent his numbers would tank so badly in utah  actually a great book by a great and highly respected historian doug wead  could it be even remotely possible that in roger goodell's rather interesting statement of peace and reconciliation he was intimating that it would now be ok for the players to kneel or not to stand for the national anthem thereby disrespecting our country  our flag colin powell was a pathetic interview today on fake news cnn in his time he was weak  gave away everything to everybody so bad for the usa also got the weapons of mass destruction totally wrong and you know what that mistake cost us sad only negative questions asked if i wasn't constantly harassed for three years by fake and illegal investigations russia russia russia and the impeachment hoax i'd be up by 25 points on sleepy joe and the do nothing democrats very unfair but it is what it is  is a superstar running against a lamb to be exact a

grossly incompetent and in no way qualified to be running an important city like washington dc if the great men and women of the national guard didn't step forward she would have looked no better than her counterpart mayor in minneapolis we should be standing up straight and tall ideally with a salute or a hand on heart there are other things you can protest but not our great american flag no kneeling i am a big fan of drew brees i think he's truly one of the greatest quarterbacks but he should not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent american flag old glory is to be revered cherished and flown high over the last number of nights if she doesn't treat these men and women well then we'll bring in a different group of men and women the incompetent mayor of washington dc  who's budget is totally out of control and is constantly coming back to us for handouts is now fighting with the national guard who saved her from great embarrassment i just signed the

with our wonderful men and women of the  what a job they are doing  the problem with asking for someone to give you a letter of resignation which you do as a courtesy to help them save face is that it is then harder to say you fired them i did fire james mattis he was no good for obama who fired him also and was no good for me in my inner-circle was totally exhausted by the job and in the end just slinked away into obscurity they all want to come back for a piece of the limelight john kelly didn't know i was going to fire james mattis nor did he have any knowledge of my asking for a letter of resignation why would i tell him he was not the problem is not the very talented low-flying helicopter pilots wanting to save our city the problem is the arsonists looters criminals and anarchists wanting to destroy it and our country michael is tough smart and loves our country this has been a big battle in congress for 25 years thank you to our great republican senate  congratulations to michael pack nobody has any idea what a big victory this is for america why because he is going to be running the voice of america  and everything associated with it i thought this letter from

doubt watch for september october november next year will be one of the best ever and look at the stock market now his primary strength was not military but rather personal public relations i gave him a new life things to do and battles to win but he seldom brought home the bacon i didn't like his leadership style or much else about him and many others agree glad he is gone probably the only thing barack obama  i have in common is that we both had the honor of firing jim mattis the world's most overrated general i asked for his letter of resignation  felt great about it his nickname was chaos which i didn't like  changed to mad dog his primary strength was not military but rather personal public relations i gave him a new life things to do and battles to win but he seldom brought home the bacon i didn't like his leadership style or much else about him and many others agree glad he is gone probably the only thing barack obama and i have in common is that we both had the honor of firing jim mattis the world's most overrated general i asked for his letter of resignation  felt great about his nickname was chaos which i didn't like  changed it to mad dog there has never been a president in the white house who has been more supportive of hbcus and their mission than president trump  the possible exception of another republican president the late great abraham lincolnand it's not even close the democrats know this and so does the fake news but they refuse to write or say it because they are inherently corrupt see pinned above in 3 1/2 years i've done much more for our black population than joe biden has done in 43 years actually he set them back big time with his crime bill which he doesn't even remember i've done more for black americans in fact than any president in us

thank you tom  anarchists we see you  trump is leading in all swing states heavily biased democrat poll just like 2016 biggest enthusiasm lead ever  sleepy joe biden's people are so radical left that they are working to get the anarchists out of jail and probably more joe doesn't know anything about it he is clueless but they will be the real power not joe they will be calling the shots big tax increases for all plus november 3rd sleep joe biden's people are so radical left that they are working to get the anarchists out of jail and probably more joe doesn't know anything about it he is clueless but they will be the real power not joe they will be calling the shots big tax increases for all plus these were the people that trashed seattle years ago who's paying for these people i was appalled that 13 of joe biden's staff were donating money to bail people out in minneapolis they should have stayed in jail until this is over and beyond   i don't see any indication that there were any white supremest groups mixing in this is an antifa organization it seems that the first time we saw it in a major way was occupy wall street it's the same mindset     true fake news law  order our national guard stopped them cold last night should have been called up sooner  so terrible where are the arrests and long term jail sentences  strength  get tough democrat mayors and governors these

their power to foment hatred and anarchy as long as everybody understands what they are doing that they are fake news and truly bad people with a sick agenda we can easily work through them to greatness the united states of america will be designating antifa as a terrorist organization other democrat run cities and states should look at the total shutdown of radical left anarchists in minneapolis last night the national guard did a great job and should be used in other states before it is too late congratulations to our national guard for the great job they did immediately upon arriving in minneapolis minnesota last night the antifa led anarchists among others were shut down quickly should have been done by mayor on first night and there would have been no trouble let new york's finest be new york's finest there is nobody better but they must be allowed to do their job the national guard has been released in minneapolis to do the job that the democrat mayor couldn't do should have been used 2 days ago  there would not have been damage  police headquarters would not have been taken over  ruined great job by the national guard no games mn gov walz we estimate 80percent of the rioters are from out of state  via  hopefully a great successful and safe rocket launch lifting off soon     80percent of the rioters in minneapolis last night were from out of state they are harming businesses especially african american small businesses homes and the community of good hardworking minneapolis residents who want peace equality and to provide for their families much more disinformation coming out of cnn msdnc  and  by far than coming out of any foreign country even combined fake news is the enemy of the people crossing state lines to incite violence is a federal crime liberal governors and mayors must get much tougher or the federal government will step in and do what has to be done and that includes using the unlimited power of our military and many arrests thank you here we go again fake news  is blaming russia russia russia they are sick losers with very bad ratings ps can't blame china because they need the cash it's antifa and the radical left don't lay the blame on others mayor jacob frey of minneapolis will never be mistaken for the late great general douglas mcarthur or great fighter general george patton how come all of these places that defend so poorly are run by liberal democrats get tough and fight and arrest the bad ones strength these are organized groups that have nothing to do with george floyd sad the professionally managed so-called protesters at the white house had little to do with the memory of george floyd they were just there to cause trouble the  handled them easily tonight i understand is maga night at the white house they professionally managed so-called protesters at the white house had little to do with the memory of george floyd they were just there to cause trouble the  handled them easily tonight i understand is maga night at the white house they professionally managed so-called protesters at the white house had little to do with the memory of george floyd they were just their to cause trouble the  handled them easily tonight i understand is maga night at the white house good practice as you saw last night they were very cool  very professional never let it get out of hand thank you on the bad side the dc mayor  who is always looking for money  help wouldn't let the dc police get involved not their job nice have been greeted with the most vicious dogs and most ominous weapons i have ever seen that's when people would have been really badly hurt at least many secret service agents just waiting for action we put the young ones on the front line sir they love it and great job last night at the white house by the us  they were not only totally professional but very cool i was inside watched every move and couldn't have felt more safe they let the protesters scream  rant as much as they wanted but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line they would quickly come down on them hard didn't know what hit them the front line was replaced with fresh agents like magic big crowd professionally organized but nobody came close to breaching the fence if they had they would time for a change   it was spoken as a fact not as a statement it's very simple nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters and those looking to cause trouble on social media honor the memory of george floyd looting leads to shooting and that's why a man was shot and killed in minneapolis on wednesday night or look at what just happened in louisville with 7 people shot i don't want this to happen and that's what the expression put out last night means revoke 230 the national guard has arrived on the scene they are in minneapolis and fully prepared george floyd will not have died in vain respect his memory the national guard has been activated in minneapolis they have arrived on the seen george floyd will not have died in vain respect his memory china regulate twitter if they are going to start regulating free speech    well as they have just proven conclusively that's what they are doing repeal section 230 the president has been targeted by twitter   what about all of the lies and fraudulent statements made by adam schiff and so many others on the russian witch hunt plus plus plus what about china's propaganda who's mistakes no flags   twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies  propaganda being put out by china or the radical left democrat party they have targeted republicans conservatives  the president of the united states section 230 should be revoked by congress until then it will be regulated these thugs are dishonoring the memory of george floyd and i won't let that happen just spoke to governor tim walz and told him that the military is with him all the way any difficulty and we will assume control but when the looting starts the shooting starts thank you i can't stand back  watch this happen to a great american city minneapolis a total lack of leadership either the very weak radical left mayor jacob frey get his act together and bring the city under control or i will send in the national guard  get the job done right mail-in voting will lead to massive fraud and abuse it will also lead to the end of our great republican party we can never let this tragedy befall our nation big mail-in victory in texas court today congrats  ceo mark zuckerberg is today criticizing twitter we have a different

very sad and tragic death in minnesota of george floyd if the fisa bill is passed tonight on the house floor i will quickly veto it our country has just suffered through the greatest political crime in its history the massive abuse of fisa was a big part of it thank you to  and  for their hard work and leadership look forward to being back with you on saturday warrantless surveillance of americans is wrong twitter has now shown that everything we have been saying about them and their other compatriots is correct big action to follow the radical left lamestream media together with their partner the do nothing democrats are trying to spread a new narrative that president trump was slow in reacting to covid 19 wrong i was very fast even doing the ban on china long before anybody thought necessary psycho joe scarborough is rattled not only by his bad ratings but all of the things and facts that are coming out on the internet about opening a cold case he knows what is happening we pass 15000000 tests today by far the most in the world open safely we are acting as a police force not the fighting force that we are in afghanistan after 19 years it is time for them to police their own country bring our soldiers back home but closely watch what is going on and strike with a thunder like never before if necessary obamagate makes watergate look like small potatoes new papers make clear that the obama administration spied in an unprecedented manner on the trump campaign and beyond and even on the united states senate nobody would ever have believed that this level of illegality and corruption would be taking place in our beautiful usa we have informed both india and china that the united states is ready willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute thank you happen again just like we can't let large scale mail-in ballots take root in our country it would be a free for all on cheating forgery and the theft of ballots whoever cheated the most would win likewise social media clean up your act now republicans feel that social media platforms totally silence conservatives voices we will strongly regulate or close them down before we can ever allow this to happen we saw what they attempted to do and failed in 2016 we can't let a more sophisticated version of that former cbs reporter one of the first ‘to identify myself as a target of illegal spying under obama admin'  congratulations to author nick adams on the  publication of your new book trump and churchill defenders of western civilization certainly a great honor to be compared in any way to winston churchill   the failing  winner of  for its totally flawed coverage of the illegal russia witch hunt does its research as follows think of the absolute worst things you can say about donald j trump pretend there are sources and just say it return the pulitzers great news the boring but very nasty magazine the atlantic is rapidly failing going down the tubes and has just been forced to announce it is laying off at least 20percent of its staff in order to limp into the future this is a tough time to be in the fake news business twitter is completely stifling free speech and i as president will not allow it to happen  is now interfering in the 2020 presidential election they are saying my statement on mail-in ballots which will lead to massive corruption and fraud is incorrect based on fact-checking by fake news cnn and the amazon washington post i hope all republican house members vote no on fisa until such time as our country is able to determine how and why the greatest political criminal and subversive scandal in usa history took place a total double standard the only thing the dems have going for them is their very close relationship with the fake news lamestream media didn't obama whose administration has now been caught cold illegally spying on the trump campaign recently also get caught playing golf on a course in virginia despite his wife michelle urging people to stay home before and after his round in a major public service message how brilliant are our farmers thank you  real talent   one person lost to this invisible virus is too much it should have been stopped at its source china but i acted very quickly and made the right decisions many of the current political complainers thought at the time that i was moving far to fast like crazy nancy for all of the political hacks out there if i hadn't done my job well  early we would have lost 1 1/2 to 2 million people as opposed to the 100000 plus that looks like will be the number that's 15 to 20 times more than we will lose i shut down entry from china very early we made most governors look very good even great by getting them the ventilators unlimited testing and supplies all of which they should have had in their own stockpiles so they look great and i just keep rolling along doing great things and getting fake lamestream news stock market up big dow crosses 25000 sp 500 over 3000 states should open up asap the transition to greatness has started ahead of schedule there will be ups and downs but next year will be one of the best

questions but i won't bring them up now law enforcement eventually will the opening of a cold case against psycho joe scarborough was not a donald trump original thought this has been going on for

got caught plus many  really have you looked at the numbers lately  fake polling just like 2016 but worse what happened to general michael flynn a war hero should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the united states again does anybody really believe that roger stone a man whose house was raided early in the morning by 29 gun toting fbi agents with fake news  closely in toe was treated fairly how about the jury forewoman with her unannounced hatred  bias same scammers as general flynn despite reports to the contrary sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown as of today 2462 people have died there a much higher number than the neighboring countries of norway 207 finland 206 or denmark 443 the united states made the correct decision lyin' brian williams of msdnc  i must admit that lyin' brian williams is while dumber than hell quite a bit smarter than fake news  anchorman don lemon the dumbest man on television then you have psycho joe what ever happened to your girlfriend scarborough another of the low iq individuals lyin' brian williams of msdnc a concast scam company wouldn't know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter totally made up story he's a true dummy who was thrown off network news like a dog stay tuned just told that fake news  is falsely reporting that i was recently shouting at my campaign manager over made up nonsense actually he is doing a great job i never shouted at him been with me for years including the 2016 win  have no intention to do so just fake news  doesn't want to speak about their persecution of general michael flynn  why they got the story so wrong they along with others should pay a big price for what they have purposely done to this man  his family they won't even cover the big breaking news about this scam happy birthday to three time olympian and five term congressman  no i think amash would make a wonderful candidate especially since he is way behind in his district and has no chance of maintaining his congressional seat he almost always votes for the do nothing dems anyway i like him even more than jill stein  thank you    at least they admit it the failing    never correct their fake reporting  the only reason the us has reported one million cases of coronavirus is that our testing is sooo much better than any other country in the world other countries are way behind us in testing and therefore show far fewer cases thank you michael   thank you  and     but i love diamond  silk and so do millions of people  texas to open businesses in phases beginning friday great job being done by  many states moving to safely  quickly reopen we are doing far more and better testing than any other country in the world and yet the media does nothing but complain no matter how good a job is done the same as with the ventilators they will never say we are doing a great job they will only viciously gripe because shifty is a crooked politician  i will be having a white house press conference today at 5:30 pm thank you why should the people and taxpayers of america be bailing out poorly run states like illinois as example and cities in all cases democrat run and managed when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help i am open to discussing anything but just asking fake news the enemy of the people there has never been in the history of our country a more vicious or hostile lamestream media than there is right now even in the midst of a national emergency the invisible enemy blame the democrats for any lateness in your enhanced unemployment insurance i wanted the money to be paid directly they insisted it be paid by states for distribution i told them this would happen especially with many states which have old computers so true  american citizens we were long ahead of dems who were all against the ban  great  they are one of the worst in the news business total slime balls  they asked me to be at west point on june 13th  i will be there  laura just another fake news report  does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called noble not nobel prize is especially as it pertains to reporters and journalists noble is defined as having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals does sarcasm ever work reports that hhs secretary  is going to be fired by me are fake news the lamestream media knows this but they are desperate to create the perception of chaos  havoc in the minds of the public they never even called to ask alex is doing an excellent job fraud  and others who are even worse chris wallace is nastier to republicans than even deface the nation or sleepy eyes the people who are watching  in record numbers thank you president trump are angry they want an alternative now so do i even the radical left do nothing democrats laughed at the fox suggestion no respect for the people running  but fox keeps on plugging to try and become politically correct they put rino paul ryan on their board they hire debate questions to crooked hillary  just doesn't get what's happening they are being fed democrat talking points and they play them without hesitation or research they forgot that fake news   msdnc wouldn't let  participate even a little bit in the poor ratings democrat debates lawsuits should be brought against all including the fake news organizations to rectify this terrible injustice for all of the great lawyers out there do we have any takers when will the noble committee act better be fast to the real reporters  journalists who got it right i can give the committee a very comprehensive list when will the noble committee demand the prizes back especially since they were gotten under fraud the reporters and lamestream media knew the truth all along when will all of the reporters who have received noble prizes for their work on russia russia russia only to have been proven totally wrong and in fact it was the other side who committed the crimes be turning back their cherished nobles so that they can be given schedule and eating habits written by a third rate reporter who knows nothing about me i will

great and important industry  it will be kept that way we will remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care they need no resource will be spared  to unleash the full power of the federal government in this effort today i am officially declaring a national emergency  i will be having a news conference today at 3:00 pm the white house topic coronavirus to this point and because we have had a very strong border policy we have had 40 deaths related to coronavirus if we had weak or open borders that number would be many times higher the federal reserve must finally lower the fed rate to something comparable to their competitor central banks jay powell and group are putting us at a decided economic  physiological disadvantage should never have been this way also stimulate if you want to get money into the hands of people quickly  efficiently let them have the full money that they earned approve a payroll tax cut until the end of the year december 31 then you are doing something that is really meaningful only that will make a big difference  their response to h1n1 swine flu was a full scale disaster with thousands dying and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem until now the changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis all red tape has been cut ready to go for decades the  looked at and studied  its testing system but did nothing about it it would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic but a pandemic would never happen they hoped president obama made changes that only complicated things further the obama white house had to immediately issue an apology for joe biden's remarks and any alarm that he might have caused an alarm about a swine flu outbreak that took 6 months for president obama to declare a national emergency and that killed 12000 americans  sleepy joe biden was in charge of the h1n1 swine flu epidemic which killed thousands of people the response was one of the worst on record our response is one of the best with fast action of border closings  a 78percent approval rating the highest on record his was lowest just had a great conversation with prime minister abe of japan i told him that the just completed olympic venue is magnificent he has done an incredible job one that will make him very proud good things will happen for japan and their great prime minister lots of options 108 countries are dealing with the coronavirus problem some of which we are helping keeping the workplace safe encourage your employees to  keeping commercial establishments safe encourage your employees and customers to  keeping the school safe encourage your faculty staff and students to  keeping the home safe encourage your family members to  many republican senators want me to veto the fisa bill until we find out what led to and happened with the illegal attempted coup of the duly elected president of the united states and others nancy pelosi all of a sudden doesn't like the payroll tax cut but when obama proposed it she thought it was a brilliant thing that all of the working families would benefit from because if you get a paycheck you're going to take home more money   hoping to get the payroll tax cut approved by both republicans and democrats and please remember very important for all countries  businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from europe the restriction stops people not goods the media should view this as a time of unity and strength we have a common enemy actually an enemy of the world the coronavirus we must beat it as quickly and safely as possible there is nothing more important to me than the life  safety of the united states i will be addressing the nation this evening at 9:00 pm eastern from the oval office i am fully prepared to use the full power of the federal government to deal with our current challenge of the coronavirus we have the

with them for 1 1/2 years there is another russia russia russia meeting today it is headed up by corrupt politician adam shifty schiff so i wouldn't expect too much  the federal reserve must be a leader not a very late follower which it has been our pathetic slow moving federal reserve headed by jay powell who raised rates too fast and lowered too late should get our fed rate down to the levels of our competitor nations they now have as much as a two point advantage with even bigger currency help also stimulate well deserved jack a great honor  true with number 1 being more important

him massachusetts and came in third he shouldn't the democrat establishment came together and crushed bernie sanders again even the fact that elizabeth warren stayed in the race was devastating to bernie and allowed sleepy joe to unthinkably win massachusetts it was a perfect storm with many good states remaining for joe thank you california   thank you utah   but they really knew who was going to win  elizabeth pocahontas warren other than mini mike was the loser of the night she didn't even come close to winning her home state of massachusetts well now she can just sit back with her

wasting time on the immigration hoax  anything else they could do to make the republican party look bad while i was busy calling early border  flight closings putting us way ahead in our battle with coronavirus dems called it very wrong so the coronavirus which started in china and spread to various countries throughout the world but very slowly in the us because president trump closed our border and ended flights very early is now being blamed by the do nothing democrats to be the fault of trump so nice  diagnosis positive  is infected with trump derangement syndrome i'm calling out cnn for irresponsibly politicizing what should be a unifying battle against a virus that doesn't choose sides    like i say they are fake news word is that mini mike bloomberg performed so poorly in the two debates that he is thinking about dropping out of the democrat primary the fact is he was not true to himself and the public was able to quickly figure him out not a good experience for mini mike congratulations and thank you to our great vice president  all of the many professionals doing such a fine job at cdc  all other agencies on the coronavirus situation only a very small number in us  china numbers look to be going down all countries working well together do nothing democrats were busy wasting their time on the impeachment hoax  anything they could do to make the republican party look bad while i was busy calling early boarder  flight closings putting us way ahead in our battle with the coronavirus dems called it very wrong anti-trump network  doing whatever it can to stoke a national coronavirus panic the far left network pretty much ignoring anyone who they interview who doesn't blame president trump   media refuses to discuss the great job our professionals are doing they spied on my campaign   r of texas-08 loves texas  our country he has been a great congressman  supporter of  strong on crime border military vets and your 2a he is the best tax cutter in dc kevin

 big story big win except in the fake news which won't cover it  during a debate pocahontas was mean  undisciplined mostly aiming at crazy bernie and mini mike they don't know how to handle her but i know she is a chocker steyer was a disaster who along with mini are setting records in $'s per vote just give me an opponent crazy chaotic democrat debate last night fake news said biden did well even though he said half of our population was shot to death would be over for most mini mike was weak and unsteady but helped greatly by his many commercials which are not supposed to be allowed i will be having a news conference at the white house on this subject today at 6:00 pm cdc representatives and others will be there thank you low ratings fake news msdnc comcast   are doing everything possible to make the caronavirus look as bad as possible including panicking markets if possible likewise their incompetent do nothing democrat comrades are all talk no action usa in great shape  just landed india was great trip very successful heading to the white house meetings and calls scheduled today   and all doing a great job with respect to coronavirus briefing this afternoon us acted on the coronavirus very very quickly gordon chang   thank you  russia wants him to win  an absolute disgrace  52percent in the new rasmussen poll 95percent approval rating in the republican party thank you democrats talking point is that we are doing badly if the virus disappeared tomorrow they would say we did a really poor and even incompetent job not fair but it is what it is so far by the way we have not had one death let's keep it that way cdc and my administration are doing a great job of handling coronavirus including the very early closing of our borders to certain areas of the world it was opposed by the dems too soon but turned out to be the correct decision no matter how well we do however the that is because they cover your favorite president relatively well   msdnc are dying in the ratings  no surprise  true but we are getting it all done  a total miscarriage of justice  there has rarely been a juror so tainted as the forewoman in the roger stone case look at her background she never revealed her hatred of trump and stone she was totally biased as is the judge roger wasn't even working on my campaign miscarriage of justice sad to watch cryin' chuck schumer is complaining for publicity purposes only that i should be asking for more money than $25 billion to prepare for coronavirus if i asked for more he would say it is too much he didn't like my early travel closings i was right he is incompetent on all trump or trump related matters while elections have consequences i only ask for fairness especially when it comes to decisions made by the united states supreme court sotomayor accuses gop appointed justices  of being biased in favor of trump    this is a terrible thing to say trying to shame some into voting her way she never criticized justice ginsberg when she called me a faker both should recuse themselves it has been a scam right from the beginning with the illegally started mueller report fisa the leaking lying  more schiff should not have access to intelligence he is a corrupt pol amazing that they went to bernie sanders but not to president trump  us intelligence official overstated assessment of russian efforts to help trump   they supposedly told crazy bernie that russia was looking at him not me this is all a big scam between intel and the democrats they want bernie out  hate trump spelled  great new book just out taken for granted how conservatives can win back americans that liberalism failed by gianni caldwell a young winner he will be at the ronald reagan library simi valley california on thursday at 6 pm pt check it out totally

serious ramifications they say roger stone lied to congress   oh i see but so did comey and he also leaked classified information for which almost everyone other than crooked hillary clinton goes to jail for a long time and so did andy mccabe who also lied to the fbi fairness this makes mini mike look good compared to his performance last night worst debate performance in history  a really great

people of new york he supports our  agenda will continue to secure our border loves our military vets and is strong on the  chris has my complete endorsement for the special election on 4/28 the

napolitano  judge jackson now has a request for a new trial based on the unambiguous  self outed bias of the foreperson of the jury whose also a lawyer by the way ‘madam foreperson you're a lawyer you have a duty an affirmative obligation to reveal to us when we selected you the the united states is open for business i have seen some of the regulations being circulated including those being contemplated by congress and they are ridiculous i want to make it easy to do business with the united states not difficult everyone in my administration is being so instructed with no excuses product and goods to china and other countries that's what trade is all about we don't want to make it impossible to do business with us that will only mean that orders will go to someplace else as an example i want china to buy our jet engines the best in the world the united states cannot  will not become such a difficult place to deal with in terms of foreign countries buying our product including for the always used national security excuse that our companies will be forced to leave in order to remain competitive we want to sell the united states is open for business i have seen some of the regulations being circulated including those being contemplated by congress and they are ridiculous i want to make it easy to do business with the united states not difficult everyone in my administration is being so instructed with no excuses judge jackson now has a request for a new trial based on the unambiguous  self outed bias of the foreperson of the jury whose also a lawyer by the way ‘madam foreperson you're a lawyer you have a duty an affirmative obligation to reveal to us when we selected you the the united states is open for business i have seen some of the regulations

president i'd be suing everyone all over the place these were mueller prosecutors and the whole mueller investigation was illegally set up based on a phony and now fully discredited fake dossier lying and forging documents to the fisa court and many other things everything having to do with this fraudulent investigation is would order a new trial i'm not so sure about judge jackson i don't know  andrew napolitano  existence of these tweets in which you were so harshly negative about the president  the people who support him don't you think we wanted to know that before we put you on this jury' pretty obvious he should get a new trial i think almost any judge in the country judge jackson now has a request for a new trial based on the unambiguous  self outed bias of the foreperson of

romney many highly religious people all very smart voted against the impeachment hoax  was all in a great person i was told by many that manchin was just a puppet for schumer  pelosi that's what he is

west virginia than me pensions and that will president trump with smart policies has done more to help the black community than any president in the modern era   the president has never asked me to do

mike is a 5'4 mass of dead energy who does not want to be on the debate stage with these professional politicians no boxes please he hates crazy bernie and will with enough money possibly stop him bernie's people will go nuts mini mike bloomberg is a loser who has money but can't debate and has zero presence you will see he reminds me of a tiny version of jeb low energy bush but jeb has more political skill and has treated the black community much better than mini  deven nunes predicts that more examples of mueller team misconduct will be revealed in coming weeks    now it looks like the

happen it is very important for our country's security that the united states senate not vote for the iran war powers resolution we are doing very well with iran and this is not the time to show weakness americans overwhelmingly support our attack on terrorist soleimani  every democrat is running to raise taxes she pocahontas lied about her ethnicity that was her problem   so true dagen two months in jail for a swamp creature yet 9 years recommended for roger stone who was not even working for the trump campaign gee that sounds very fair rogue prosecutors maybe the swamp   congratulations to attorney general bill barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought evidence now clearly shows that the mueller scam was improperly brought  tainted even bob mueller lied to congress fake news  and msdnc have not surprisingly refused to talk about my record setting number of voters in new hampshire and in iowa that's why they are poorly rated fake news i will win both states in november the fake news media is looking hard for the big democrat story but there is nothing too fabulous wouldn't a big story be that i got more new hampshire primary votes than any incumbent president in either party in the history of that great state not an insignificant fact thank you brad  prosecutorial misconduct  bootedgeedge buttigieg is doing pretty well tonight giving crazy bernie a run for his money very interesting a very bad night for mini mike a lot of democrat dropouts tonight very low political iq  who are the four prosecutors mueller people who cut and ran after being exposed for recommending a ridiculous 9 year prison sentence to a man that got caught up in an investigation that was illegal the mueller scam and shouldn't ever even have started 13 angry democrats impeachment king steyer how did that work out spent 200 million dollars and got less than 1percent of the vote in iowa and only 3percent of the vote in new hampshire could it be that something is just plain missing not easy to do what i did is it elizabeth warren sometimes referred to as pocahontas is having a really bad night i think she is sending signals that she wants out calling for unity is her way of getting there going home and having a nice cold beer with her husband whatever happened to hillary campaign manager podesta's brother wasn't he caught forced to leave his firm with big bad things to happen why did nothing ever happen to him only to the other side and a swamp creature with pull was just sentenced to two months in jail for a similar thing that they want stone to serve 9 years for a phony mueller witch hunt disgrace caught  is this the judge that put paul manafort in solitary confinement something that not even mobster al capone had to endure how did she treat crooked hillary clinton just asking  all starting to unravel with the ridiculous 9 year sentence recommendation  when jerome powell started his testimony today the dow was up 125  heading higher as he spoke it drifted steadily downward as usual and is now at -15 germany  other countries get paid to borrow money we are more prime but fed rate is too high dollar tough on exports mini mike is a short ball very hitter tiny club head speed keep america great  new stock market record congratulations spend your money wisely keep america great great being in new hampshire last night i would say that was the biggest political rally in new hampshire history incredible evening wow bloomberg is a total racist  best usa economy in history this is a horrible and very unfair situation the real crimes were on the other side as nothing happens to them cannot allow this miscarriage of justice  just returned to white house from dover very sad  nice conflict brown dropped out of presidential race fast polled at zero  disgraceful  should never happen to another president  tough guys for trump  thank you new hampshire   a lot of people feel defeatedtrump always wins it seems like nothing can stop him danny villazon      but isn't that what you want from your president wall street journal editorial she crazy nancy aimed at trump and hit uncle joe meeting with us governors in a short while all states are doing well thank you mr president thank you to  of the new york post for your interesting and correct column today

news which never discusses it is talking about the big crowds forming for my new hampshire rally tonight they won't because of how badly they did with the impeachment hoax aoc will primary cryin' chuck schumer and win and jerry nadler has a good chance of losing to his far left primary opponent it is all getting quite interesting pelosi will lose the house again my poll numbers great 95percent approval rating in the republican party a record 53percent overall plus add 9 points corrupt democrat politicians have brought me to highest polling numbers ever with the impeachment hoax thank you nancy will be in manchester new hampshire tonight for a big rally want to shake up the dems a little bit they have a really boring deal going on still waiting for the iowa results votes were fried big crowds in manchester make america great again and then keep america great drain the swamp this is the biggest political crime in american history by far simply put the party in power illegally spied on my campaign both before and after the election in order to change or nullify the results of the election it continued on with the impeachment hoax terrible fbi director christopher wray just admitted that the fisa warrants and survailence of my campaign were illegal so was the fake dossier therefore the whole scam investigation the mueller report and everything else for three years was a fixed hoax who pays the price so good to see that republicans will be winning the great state of alabama senate seat back now that lightweight senator  cast a partisan vote for the impeachment hoax thought his boss cryin' chuck would have forced him to vote against the hoax a do nothing stiff  is much better at giving you the answer after everything is finished and the final result is in than he is at telling you what is going to happen because in fact he doesn't have a clue  sabato got it all wrong last time never came close to understanding the trump voter actually it's simple make america great again and then keep america great  it's all turning and fast mvp heckler  they conservatives thought the merits of the impeachment case were weak and therefore his romney's judgement is questioned    they are really mad at senator joe munchkin in west virginia he couldn't understand the transcripts romney could but didn't want to romney hurt some very good republican senators and he was wrong about the impeachment hoax no clue  yes  this is so true  this will never get old  deface the nation will tell  that he must start up judiciary and not stop until the job is done clean up dc now last chance  i grew up in new york city and over many years got to watch how great nyc's finest are now because of weak leadership at governor  mayor stand away water thrown at them regulations and lack of support our wonderful nyc police are under assault stop this now the dems are crazed they will do anything honesty  truth don't matter to them they are badly wounded iowa vote count was a disaster for them  leading also in new hampshire and most states the fake news hates to report this but you will see on november 3rd  the feeling of many about   thank you to everyone for all of the great reviews i have gotten on my state of the union speech it was an immense honor for me to have presented it to you and the citizens of our very strong and wonderful country but just like the people of west virginia will no longer look at weak  pathetic joe manchin the same i got the pension bill approved manchin couldn't do it the wonderful people of utah will never look at grandstander mitt romney with anything but contempt  disgust can't say i mind the fact that the great people of west virginia are furious at their puppet democrat senator joe manchin they will never forget his phony vote on the impeachment hoax all he had to do is read the transcripts sadly which he wouldn't understand anyway law enforcement has been notified be careful tough guys who you play with  great lineup on  tonight with   and   all starts at 8:00 pm will be discussing and explaining the impeachment hoax a great coach and a fantastic guy his endorsement of me in indiana was a very big deal  pete rose played major league baseball for 24 seasons from 1963-1986 and had more hits 4256 than any other player by a wide margin he gambled but only on his own team winning and paid a decades long price get pete rose into the baseball hall of fame it's time total and complete endorsement for debbie lesko   love arizona  governor cuomo wanted to see me this weekend he just canceled very hard to work with new york so stupid all they do is sue me all the time  more fake news this was photoshopped obviously but the wind was strong and the hair looks good anything to demean  we will not be touching your social security or medicare in fiscal 2021 budget only the democrats will destroy them by destroying our country's greatest ever economy the worst weeks ever she could have had a much better week if crazy nancy who is the most overrated person in politics going to lose the house a second time didn't bring the phony  corrupt impeachment hoax dems can't do anything right just look at the iowa vote count  who called me tears flowing to thank me for rolling out the maximum red carpet for the funeral of her husband then voted against me on the partisan impeachmen hoax said everybody dems wants to get out of town this has been in my whole career one of the only way to stop the crazed radical left do nothing democrats is for the republican senate to run an offense here      so true although the dems hoaxes  witch hunts have driven up republican polls and mine mightily crazy nancy pelosi's impeachment hoax has lifted republican congressional polls she lost the house once before and my polls way up which was expected but it has had a great effect on republican senate races including north carolina kentucky colorado and arizona thanks thank you iowa for the record vote we just received in the primary the dems were 25percent down although their votes are all fried  was given a horrendous report by his superior the man he reported to who publicly stated that vindman had problems with judgement adhering to the chain of command and leaking information in other words out fake news   msdnc keep talking about lt col vindman as though i should think only how wonderful he was actually i don't know him never spoke to him or met him i don't believe but he was very insubordinate reported contents of my perfect calls incorrectly  not good  after years building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country from our inner cities to our rural communities the forgotten men and women of america are forgotten no longer   always continue every republican senator except romney many highly religious people all very smart voted against the impeachment hoax  was all in a great person i was told by many that manchin was just a puppet for schumer  pelosi that's all he is i was very surprised  disappointed that senator joe manchin of west virginia voted against me on the democrat's totally partisan impeachment hoax no president has done more for the great people of west virginia than me pensions and that will great to be in charlotte north carolina as we expand and grow this unprecedented economic momentum today we launched a brand new nationwide campaign to revitalize under-served cities and towns across america  it's called opportunity now  another win just in nervous nancy pelosi and the democrats in congress sued me thrown out this one unanimous in the dc circuit witch hunt jobs jobs jobs 🇺🇸  iowa and new hampshire will not be moved from the primary schedule as long as i am president great tradition off to north carolina  the democrat party has given up on counting votes in iowa looks like it all got computer fried nobody knows who the real winner is maybe it's sleepy joe but it's not looking that way they lost millions  millions of dollars all for nothing but i won iowa big i think they should blame russia russia russia again if they can't count votes properly how are they going to run us healthcare  welcome back james  very true thank you ted  john i love texas  so do i  thank you charlie  don't worry it won't happen  he will be successful especially as the weather starts to warm  the virus hopefully becomes weaker and then gone

by phone with president xi of china he is strong sharp and powerfully focused on leading the counterattack on the coronavirus he feels they are doing very well even building hospitals in a matter of only days nothing is easy but the senate acquitted president trump of both charges fabricated by congressional democrats led by speaker pelosi and adam schiff to carry out the most egregious and partisan attack against any president in our history a man they knew to be innocent   this president has done more for african americans in this country than any president since lincoln  welcome back

spacewalk in history last year nevada i hear you on yucca mountain and my administration will respect you congress and previous administrations have long failed to find lasting solutions  my administration is committed to exploring innovative approaches  i'm confident we can get it done so true  had failed presidential candidate  devoted the same energy and anger to defeating a faltering barack obama as he sanctimoniously does to me he could have won the election read the transcripts  the votes were a resounding victory for mr trump true but the impeachment hoax was just a continuation of the radical left do nothing democrats corrupt practices what really happened i will be making a public statement tomorrow at 12:00pm from the  to discuss our country's victory on the

people of our country promises made promises kept  usmca is a massive win for american manufacturers and auto workers  they will never be satisfied  the best evidence is the transcript itself  brad blakeman   there is much talk that certain democrats are going to be voting with republicans on the impeachment hoax so that the senate can get back to the business of taking care of the american people sorry but cryin' chuck schumer will never let that happen on the iraq war resolution being voted on tomorrow in the house of represenatives we are down to 5000 soldiers and going down and i want everyone republican and democrat to vote their heart mark penn harris poll it's time to end the impeachment trial   just another political hoax by the dems remember republicans the democrats already had 17 witnesses we were given none witnesses are up to the house not up to the senate don't let the dems play you many more mistakes of judgement gets fired because frankly if i listened to him we would be in world war six by now and goes out and immediately writes a nasty  untrue book all classified national security who would do this for a guy who couldn't get approved for the ambassador to the un years ago couldn't get approved for anything since begged me for a non senate approved job which i gave him despite many saying don't do it sir takes the job mistakenly says libyan model on tv and democrats admitting the impeachment hoax  thank you  175000 ticket requests keep america great  why didn't john bolton complain about this nonsense a long time ago when he was very publicly terminated he said not that it matters nothing no matter how many witnesses you give the democrats no matter how much information is given like the quickly produced transcripts it will

missiles my administration has done far more than the previous administration transcripts of my calls with president zelensky are all the proof that is needed in addition to the fact that president zelensky  the foreign minister of ukraine said there was no pressure and no problems additionally i met with president zelensky at the united nations i never told john bolton that the aid to ukraine was tied to investigations into democrats including the bidens in fact he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination if john bolton said this it was only to sell a book

lawyers will be forced to start on saturday which is called death valley in tv a foreign power engaged in clandestine intelligence activities and yet they still asked for the renewal two more times and it gave the right for the government to rifle through the trump campaigns files  emails text messages so how bad  illegal is that  frances hakes former federal prosecutor this is really significant the fbi had debunked the steele dossier in january of 2017 and then even after they did that even after they knew from the cia  from their own sources they knew that carter page was not

states looks forward to welcoming prime minister   blue  white chairman  to the  next week reports about details and timing of our closely-held peace plan are purely speculative the democrats don't want a witness trade because shifty schiff the biden's the fake whistleblower his lawyer the second whistleblower who vanished after i released the transcripts the so-called informer  many other democrat disasters would be a big problem for them this is all about undermining the next election liz peek  during his hopeless presidential campaign they will remain silent the fact is when mini losses he will be spending very little of his money on these clowns because he will consider himself to be the biggest clown of them all and he will be right mini mike bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting democrat rivals he says that if he loses he really means when in the primaries he will spend money helping whoever the democrat nominee is by doing this he figures they won't hit him as hard the democrats  shifty schiff whose presentation to the senate was loaded with lies and misrepresentations are refusing to state that the obama administration withheld aid from many countries including ukraine pakistan philippines egypt honduras  mexico witch hunt no matter what you give to the radical left do nothing democrats it will never be enough the democrat house would not give us lawyers or not one witness but now demand that the republican senate produce the witnesses that the house never sought or even asked for they had their chance but pretended to rush most unfair  corrupt hearing in congressional history in an impeachment you can't use a work of fiction as the theory for the case filling in gaps with presumptions against the president it was a weak presentation self indulgent  he didn't deliver the goods robert charles   of the 2020 election becsuse it weaponizes a process that should only be initiated in exceedingly rare circumstances and should never be used for partisan purposes   the democrats are trying hard to damage republicans prior to the election attorney generals from 21 states are urging the senate to reject impeachment they say the articles have legal  factual problems and the democrats case sets a dangerous historical precedent even an unsuccessful effort to impeach the president undermines the integrity there is no evidence of a crime robert charles fmr asst secy of state the crimes were committed by the other side schiff doesn't have a case telling the truth so he's manufacturing things rush limbaugh  sorry if

powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world by far i will be making a statement tomorrow morning had a very good meeting with  of saudi arabia we discussed trade military oil prices security and stability in the middle east great interview with  kevin mccarthy on  there was no urgency with the articles of impeachment because there was no case we love australia  amazing analysis  reporting  if however the city or state in question is willing to acknowledge responsibility and politely asks for help from the federal government we will very seriously consider getting involved in order to make those poorly run democrat cities great again the homeless situation in los angeles san francisco and many other democrat party run cities throughout the nation is a state and local problem not a federal problem iran will never have a nuclear weapon congress  the president should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan impeachment hoax when we have so many important matters pending 196 to zero was the republican house vote  we got 3 dems this was not what the founders had in mind the impeachment hoax just a continuation of the witch hunt which started even before i won the election must end quickly read the transcripts see the ukrainian president's strong statement no pressure get this done it is a con game by the dems to help with the election the reason they are not sending the articles of impeachment to the senate is that they are so weak and so pathetic    the great scam continues to be spending time on this political hoax at this moment in our history when i am so busy is sad these media posts will serve as notification to the united states congress that should iran strike any us person or target the united states will quickly  fully strike back  perhaps in a disproportionate manner such legal notice is not required but is given nevertheless the united states just spent two trillion dollars on military equipment we are the biggest and by far the best in the world if iran attacks an american base or any american we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their wayand without hesitation they attacked us  we hit back if they attack again which i would strongly advise them not to do we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before  targeted 52 iranian sites representing the 52 american hostages taken by iran many years ago some at a very high level  important to iran   the iranian culture and those targets and iran itself will be hit very fast and very hard the usa wants no more threats hundreds of iranian protesters he was already attacking our embassy and preparing for additional hits in other locations iran has been nothing but problems for many years let this serve as a warning that if iran strikes any americans or american assets we have iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain usa assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an american  badly wounded many others not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime including recently as hard as i work  as successful as our country has become with our economy our military  everything else it is ashame that the democrats make us spend so much time  money on this ridiculous impeachment lite hoax i should be able to devote all of my time to the real usa 95percent approval rating in the republican party thank you followed and then it was withdrawn the democrats argument for impeachment has not gotten stronger over the last few weeks as senator josh hawley just said he's going to enter a motion to dismiss the impeachment trial because it's never actually been brought to trial different places that he thought were wasteful and the career staff as they always do pushed back and made a million excuses as to why they could not possibly stop spending us taxpayer money there was a back  forth over the legal arguments  the wh decision was christopher bedford the federalist senior editor there is nothing new in these emails at all that's been discovered it's exactly what we knew before which is that the white house  political figures wanted to cut off aid trump wanted to question aid to a number of this is a great book a must read  and more control over iraq and the people of iraq are not happy with that it will never end well the united states has paid iraq billions of dollars a year for many years that is on top of all else we have done for them the people of iraq don't want to be dominated  controlled by iran but ultimately that is their choice over the last 15 years iran has gained more of protesters killed in iran itself while iran will never be able to properly admit it soleimani was both hated and feared within the country they are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe he should have been taken out many years ago general qassem soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of americans over an extended period of time and was plotting to kill many morebut got caught he was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people including the recent large number iran never won a war but never lost a negotiation followed and then it was withdrawn the democrats argument for impeachment has not gotten stronger over the last few weeks as senator josh hawley just said he's going to enter a motion to dismiss the impeachment trial because it's never actually been brought to trial different places that he thought were wasteful and the career staff as they always do pushed back and nade s million excuses as to why they could not possibly stop spending ustaxpayer money there was a back  forth over the legal arguments  the wh decision wasq christopher bedford the federalist senior editor there is nothing new in these emails at all that's been discovered it's exactly what we knew before which is that the white house  political figures wanted to cut off aid trump wanted to question aid to a number of had happened to a presidential candidate or president who was a democrat everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason and more and it would be considered the crime of the century far bigger and more sinister than watergate a lot of very good people were taken down by a small group of dirty filthy cops politicians government officials and an investigation that was illegally started  that spied on my campaign the witch hunt is sputtering badly but still going on ukraine hoax if this it's alienating independents this president is being persecuted over three years with one investigation after another and that really plays to his base     their partisan witch hunt is hurting our country do badly  only bringing more division than ever sohrab ahmari new york post the trump campaign raised $10 million in the two days following the impeachment scam vote it seems the democrats have shot themselves

the greatest witch hunt in american history on 51 votes which is procedural you don't need two thirds  brad blakeman   a great lawyer  person thank you brad it's my opinion as a lawyer that the articles of impeachment are defective on their face which means i would like to see a motion to dismiss and have this disbursed without the necessity of a trial i don't think there should be a trial i think it should be dismissed remember when pelosi was screaming that president trump is a danger to our nation and we must move quickly they didn't get one republican house vote and lost 3 dems they produced no case so now she doesn't want to go to the senate she's all lies most overrated person i know read the transcripts very good meeting on the middle east the military and trade heading back

thank you to them iran killed an american contractor wounding many we strongly responded and always will now iran is orchestrating an attack on the us embassy in iraq they will be held fully responsible in addition we expect iraq to use its forces to protect the embassy and so notified the democrats will do anything to avoid a trial in the senate in order to protect sleepy joe biden and

history of the united states congress and native culture  s216/spokane tribe s256/native languages and ndaa sec 2870 officially recognizing little shell tribe of chippewa indians my great honor to do so thank you indian country for being such an important part of the american story i recently signed 3 bills to support tribal sovereignty trump stock market rally is far outpacing past us presidents   with new trade deals and more the best is yet to come speaker pelosi and chuck schumer's drive to try and rig the trial against the president is misplaced there is no factual basis for the articles of impeachment that passed the house this president will be exonerated william mcginley   thank you kristy have a great year  academy award winning actor and great guy  is fantastic in the role of mickey donovan in the big television hit ray donovan from midnight cowboy to deliverance to the champ one of the best ever boxing movies  many others jon delivers big also loves the usa democrats repeatedly claimed impeachment was an urgent matter but now nancy pelosi uses stall tactics to obstruct the senate     it's all part of the impeachment hoax pelosi's stall tactics expose the weakness of democrat's impeachment case   thank you ritchie  the movie will never be the same just kidding  i guess justin t doesn't much like my making him pay up on nato or trade  california leads the nation by far in both the number of homeless people and the percentage increase in the homeless population two terrible stats crazy nancy should focus on that in her very down district and helping her incompetent governor with the big homeless problem nancy pelosi is trying to usurp the constitutional role of the senate the longer this goes on the more petty partisan  political it all looks   just more of the same from the do nothing dems nancy should be helping the record number of homeless in her d nasdaq hits 9000 for first time ever  trump stock market rally is far outpacing past us presidents  russia syria and iran are killing or on their way to killing thousands of innocent civilians in idlib province don't do it turkey is working hard to stop this carnage despite all of the great success that our country has had over the last 3 years it makes it much more difficult to deal with foreign leaders and others when i am having to constantly defend myself against the do nothing democrats  their bogus impeachment scam bad for usa nancy pelosi has no leverage over the senate mitch mcconnell did not nose his way into the impeachment process in the house and she has no standing in the senate brad blakeman crazy nancy should clean up her filthy dirty district  help the homeless there a primary for n nancy pelosi's district in california has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the us when it come to the homeless  crime it has gotten so bad so fast she has lost total control and along with her equally incompetent governor gavin newsom it is a very sad sight brad blakeman i happen to believe as a lawyer that the charges are defective they don't meet the constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors so i would like to see a motion to dismiss at least 51 republican senators would agree with that-there should be no trial the radical left do nothing democrats said they wanted to rush everything through to the senate because president trump is a threat to national security they are vicious will say anything but now they don't want to go fast anymore they want to go very slowly liars look the house is supposed to do all of this work on witnesses and documents before they send the articles over to the senate not to call in new witnesses go through new documents that work is supposed to be done in the house    overwhelming but this scam impeachment was neither also very unfair with no due process proper representation or witnesses now pelosi is demanding everything the republicans weren't allowed to have in the house dems want to run majority republican senate hypocrites why should crazy nancy pelosi just because she has a slight majority in the house be allowed to impeach the president of the united states got zero republican votes there was no crime the call with ukraine was perfect with no pressure she said it must be bipartisan  overwhelming but this scam impeachment was neither also very unfair with no due process proper representation or witnesses now pelosi is demanding everything the republicans weren't allowed to have in the house dems want to run majority republican senate hypocrites  overwhelming but this scam impeachment was neither also very unfair with no due process proper representation or witnesses now pelosi is demanding everything the republicans weren't alowed to have in the house dems want to run majority republican senate hypocrites why should crazy nancy pelosi just because she has a slight majority in the house be allowed to impeach the president of the united states got zero republican votes there was no crime the call with ukraine was perfect with no pressure she said it must be bipartisan russia syria and iran are killing or on their way to killing thousands if inocent civilians in idlib province don't do it turkey is working hard to stop this carnage wow it's all a giant scam  thank you tammy you are doing a great job  governor gavin n has done a really bad job on taking care of the homeless population in california if he can't fix the problem the federal govt will get involved  2019 holiday retail sales were up 34percent from last year the biggest number in us history congratulations america merry christmas 187 new federal judges have been confirmed under the trump administration including two great new united states supreme court justices we are shattering every record read all about this in the long game a great new book by  mitch mcconnell amazing story the only reason we were able to get our great usmca trade deal approved was because the do nothing democrats wanted to show that they could approve  something productive in light of the fact that all they even think about is impeachment she knows nothing about the usmca deal the american public's tone deafness  it should be intolerable because the american people have had it with this    the radical left do nothing democrats have gone crazy they want to make it as hard as possible for me to properly run our country the trump administration trump policies have put our economy on a trajectory it has never been on before griff jenkins  stocks kick off christmas week at all-time record highs  mount some kind of public pressure to demand witnesses but mcconnell has the votes and he can run this trial anyway he wants to   everything we're seeing from speaker pelosi and senator schumer suggests that they're in real doubt about the evidence they've brought forth so far not being good enough  and are very very urgently seeking a way to find some more evidence the only way to make this work is to the real victims here are the american people and the constitution the constitution has been damaged by this ploy being used by nancy pelosi this is a very bad time for the united states constitution   what the democrats are doing is obstruction of the senate it's wrong constitutionally it's wrong morally and it's wrong politically      l agree and so does the public the dems are complicating matters again keeping mueller out of it was the focus keeping it crisp  simple was the key and now all of a sudden they are saying maybe we'll go back and visit the mueller probe which is absolutely unbelievable and shows they don't care about stock market closes at all-time high what a great time for the radical left do nothing democrats to impeach your favorite president especially since he has not done anything wrong nasdaq up 722percent since our great 2016 election victory dow up 558percent the best is yet to come i agree 100percent  wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that republicans in the senate should handle the impeachment hoax in the exact same manner as democrats in the house handled their recent partisan scam why would it be different for republicans than it was for the radical left democrats what right does crazy nancy have to hold up this senate trial none she has a bad case and would rather not have a negative decision this witch hunt must end now with a trial in the senate or let her default  lose no more time should be wasted on this impeachment scam nancy pelosi who has already lost the house  speakership once  is about to lose it again is doing everything she can to delay the zero republican vote articles of impeachment she is trying to take over the senate  cryin' chuck is trying to take over the trial no way pelosi gives us the most unfair trial in the history of the us congress and now she is crying for fairness in the senate and breaking all rules while doing so she lost congress once she will do it again what right does crazy nancy have to hold up this senate trial none she has a bad case and would rather not have a negative decision this witch hunt must end now with a trial in the senate or let her default  lose no

vote articles of inpeachment she is trying to take over the senate  cryin' chuck is trying to take over the trial no way the democrats and crooked hillary paid for  provided a fake dossier with phony

bill so true  house democrats perpetrating a fraud on america    what's been revealed is a country in better shape than it's been in decades working men and women in the country are the beneficiaries of a president who's doing exactly what he said he was going to do that is to restore prosperity for all americans   thank you lou this is political malpractice this is a horrible judgement call on the part of the speaker you put your members in trump friendly districts in a very difficult spot it's only going to extend it out further this looks like the joke that it actually is ben domenech the reason the democrats don't want to submit the articles of impeachment to the senate is that they don't want corrupt politician adam shifty schiff to testify under oath nor do they want the whistleblower the missing second whistleblower the informer the bidens to testify i will be signing our 738 billion dollar defense spending bill today it will include 12 weeks  paid parental leave gives our troops a raise importantly creates the space force southern border wall funding repeals cadillac tax on health plans raises smocking age to 21 big the house democrats were unable to get even a single vote from the republicans on their impeachment hoax the republicans have never been so united  the dem's case is so bad that they don't even want to go to trial so after the democrats gave me no due process in the house no lawyers no witnesses no nothing they now want to tell the senate how to run their trial actually they have zero proof of anything they will never even show up they want out i want an immediate trial the great usmca trade deal mexico  canada has been sitting on nancy pelosi's desk for 8 months she doesn't even know what it says  today after passing by a wide margin in the house pelosi tried to take credit for it labor will vote for trump trade deal is great for usa jesse watters this is the best year any president has ever had plus we get an impeachment  the five  pelosi feels her phony impeachment hoax is so pathetic she is afraid to present it to the senate which can set a date and put this whole scam into default if they refuse to show up the do nothings are so bad for our country thank you rena  thank you terrence  thank you anne  our great congressman gohmert is a true patriot fighting back against people that must hate our country  this is what the dems are dealing with does anyone think this is good for the usa  i got impeached last night without one republican vote being cast with the do nothing dems on their continuation of the greatest witch hunt in american history now the do nothing party want to do nothing with the articles  not deliver them to the senate but it's senate's call presidential harassment the senate shall set the time and place of the trial if the do nothing democrats decide in their great wisdom not to show up they would lose by default 100percent republican vote that's what people are talking about the republicans are united like never before i got impeached last might without one republican vote being cast with the do nothing dems on their continuation of the greatest witch hunt in american history now the do nothing party want to do nothing with the articles  not deliver them to the senate but it's senate's call thank you   thank you michigan i am on my way see everybody soon   such atrocious lies by the radical left do nothing democrats this is an assault on america and an assault on the republican party won't convict and remove the president then the house should not be impeaching the president in the first place if this is the new standard every president from here on out is impeachable  andy mccarthy   so well stated thank you in the end here nothing happened we don't approach anything like the egregious conduct that should be necessary before a president should be removed from office i believe that a president can't be removed from office if there is no reasonable possibility that the senate the evidence has to be overwhelming and it is not it's not even close ken starr former independent counsel will go down in history as worst speaker already thrown out once  thank you  impeachment is a terrible idea for the country the more people learn about impeachment the less people want impeachment  this is all about convicting a president based on innuendo not on the facts even the ukrainian president said there was no pressure  thank you  thank you  sean p is a much stronger candidate  sean is a great patriot and will do a fantastic job has my total and complete endorsement  out and he's been amazing at it the democrsts have no message they have no hope for 2020    thank you doug had while the democrats are just looking out for elections this president should just continue to fight like he's always fought for himself  for this country continue to put forth policies like prescription drugs  trade policies that's what makes this president stand said i'm going to clean up washington i'm going to help people he gave big tax cuts he's made our military strong they're mad at him because he actually did what he said he was going to do history will record we're experiencing some of the best times we've ever it's sad here's a gentleman who came to the white house and all they had was never to let him have an easy breath all they wanted to do is impeach him they started the day after he was elected even the day after he was sworn in  but this president came to washington and they just wanted to get at the president they had no intention of having a proper investigation they couldn't find any crimes so they did a vague abuse of power and abuse of congress which every administration from the beginning has done   can you believe that i will be impeached today by the radical left do nothing democrats and i did nothing wrong a terrible thing read the transcripts this should never happen to another president again say a prayer   my hope is that impeachment will never become this trivial again   well said brian   voters say the democrats are trying to take away their votes pelosi was right the first time impeachment has backfired thoroughly on the democrats how can you impeach the president for going to the courts they want to impeach me i'm not worried and yet they were all breaking the law in so many ways how can they do that and yet impeach a very successful economy plus president of the united states who has done nothing wrong these people are crazy so if comey  the top people in the fbi were dirty cops and cheated on the fisa court wouldn't all of these phony cases have to be overturned or dismissed they went after me with the fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary  the dnc which they illegally presented to fisa good marks and reviews on the letter i sent to pelosi today she is the worst no wonder with people like her and cryin' chuck schumer dc has been such a mess for so long and that includes the previous administration who and now we know for sure spied on my campaign democrat leadership despite their denials are putting tremendous pressure on their members to vote yes on this ridiculous impeachment if they vote yes it will be much easier for republicans to win in 2020 wow in a stunning rebuke of the fbi the fisa court severly chastised the fbi for the fisa abuses brought to light in the recent inspector general's report there were at least 17 significant errors  statement by the court was long and tough means my case was a scam senator dan sullivan is doing a great job for the

ongoing violence and those that provoke it both in bolivia and from afar the us stands with the people of the region for peace and democracy chance they've had their kangaroo court they've had their circus for weeks and months there just isn't anything there and there's no way i'm voting for impeachment for somebody who hasn't committed any impeachable offenses  senator josh hawley r-mo they the dems don't have anything this whole thing is a joke and it's time to get the president exonerated the house has no evidence of any impeachable offense there's nothing there and they didn't even charge a crime they've had their would be sooo great if the fed would further lower interest rates and quantitative ease the dollar is very strong against other currencies and there is almost no inflation this is the time to do it exports would zoom the new usa today poll just out has me leading all of the democrat contenders that's hard to believe since the fake news  3 year scams and witch hunts as

china they have agreed to many structural changes and massive purchases of agricultural product energy and manufactured goods plus much more the 25percent tariffs will remain as is with 7 1/2percent

next president in 2020    looking like a big win for boris in the uk nancy pelosi just got duped in an interview to admitting that she has been working on impeaching me for two and a half years in other words she lied this was the radical left do nothing democrats plan all along long before the ukraine phone call impeachment hoax what's gone on the last three years is not reasonable the majority has been so abusive by congress by the justice department  fbi friends of the democrats who hated the president when he was nothing but a candidate at some point somebody should have said wait a minute this is out of control this train is off the tracks it's time to get reasonable   this is so surreal for three years this president has been harassed he's been electronically surveilled spied upon allegations have never ceased they continue and their continuing today at some point you would think you would look at the abuse i think it's obvious to all the american public that this is a railroad job   i also have constantly asked why aren't germany france and other european countries helping ukraine more they are the biggest beneficiaries why is it always the good ol' united states

monitor the situation as we assist local  state officials on the ground read the transcripts us is a reference to usa not me shifty schiff a totally corrupt politician made up a horrible and fraudulent statement read it to congress and said those words came from me he got caught was very embarrassed yet nothing happened to him for committing this fraud he'll eventually have to answer for this witch hunt nadler just said that i pressured ukraine to interfere in our 2020 election ridiculous and he knows that is not true both the president  foreign minister of ukraine said many times that there was no pressure nadler and the dems know this but refuse to acknowledge looking like very good democrat support for usmca that would be great for our country america's great usmca trade bill is looking good it will be the best and most important trade deal ever made by the usa good for everybody farmers manufacturers energy unions tremendous support importantly we will finally end our country's worst trade deal nafta to impeach a president who has proven through results including producing perhaps the strongest economy in our country's history to have one of the most successful presidencies ever and most importantly who has done nothing wrong is sheer political madness  i can't remember anything quite like this the ig report   i don't know what report current director of the fbi christopher wray was reading but it sure wasn't the one given to me with that kind of attitude he will never be able to fix the fbi which is badly broken despite having some of the greatest men  women working there in a very long time the fbi has had some dark day in its past but nothing like this this was very serious misconduct on the part of the fbi    are you listening comey mccabe lovers lisa  peter the beautiful ohr family brennan clapper  many more you have to look at the 17 instances of misconduct cited in the report they are very bad the fisa court was clearly taken for a ride on this a failure of the fbi up and fown the chain of command it's about as strong a medicine as i've seen in a report of this kind a great choice bill is a winner  read the transcripts true  the do nothing democrats are a disgrace  the best economy ever  witch hunt  the real deal  witch hunt  let our great soldiers fight  america first  the democrats have thrown a wrecking ball at our democracy  no president in american history has been treated like this  cnn is a ratings disaster lost all credibility  what he did is illegal schiff is a corrupt politician and a criminal  this would be the first impeachment in american history without a specific criminal statute or crime that the president whose impeached would have allegedly committed paul gigot the wall street journal american people are supposed to believe that this simply isn't a part of everthing they've been trying to do for the last three years i think it is really a hard sell for nancy pelosi   the wall street journal the democrats haven't come up with a smocking gun nancy pelosi by raising this to the level of impeachment has raised the bar impossibly high this comes after three years of nonstop investigations of trump the russian collusion narrative the mueller report  now the ig report out tomorrow that will be the big story i think the democrats are going to lose many members over this   the wall is going up fast  i got nato countries to pay 530 billion dollars a year more and the us less and came home to a fake news media that mocked me didn't think that was possible great  don't get why  puts losers on like  who got zero as presidential candidate before quitting pramila jayapal david cicilline and others who are radical left haters the dems wouldn't let  get near their bad ratings debates yet fox panders pathetic it's going to go nowhere they are going to impeach not because they have the evidence but because they hate the president i think the american people know that this is a waste of time this is democrats putting on a circus  interviewed by sleepy eyes chuck todd any president has the authority to investigate corruption the president himself released the transcript of the call now the democrats have no evidence of a crime and no evidence of violating the law this is a kangaroo court in the house but it's going to go to the senate biden on the board of the largest natural gas company in ukraine getting paid $83000 a month 10 times as much as a board member of  thank you ted he also  made a fortune from china and others but zero before his father became vp    the democrats are now admitting that they can't prove a crime they can't prove a law was violated and here's why any president any administration is justified in investigating corruption and there was serious evidence of real corruption concerning hunter less than 48 hours before start of the impeachment hearing hoax on monday the no due process do nothing democrats are believe it or not changing the impeachment guidelines because the facts are not on their side when you can't win the game change the rules with the us presidential election in november north korea under the leadership of kim jong un has tremendous economic potential but it must denuclearize as promised nato china russia japan and the entire world is unified on this issue kim jong un is too smart and has far too much to lose everything actually if he acts in a hostile way he signed a strong denuclearization agreement with me in singapore he does not want to void his special relationship with the president of the united states or interfere  congratulations to  on tonight's huge win a great american patriot   schiff's surveillance obtaining phone logs is an unprecedented abuse of power  to put it mildly also it is illegal the united states secret service deputy assistant director anthony ornato will become my new deputy chief of staff for operations i have worked with tony for 3 years he will do a fantastic job thank you to dan walsh for his great service and congratulations to tony not only have the democrats not advanced key pieces of legislation that would help the economy but the polls especially in early states are showing that voters are tuning out  they don't want our greatest of all presidents impeached why re-elect democrats when you know that this is what they are doing with their majority their case is not strong because first it was russian collusion then it was obstruction then it was ukraine now their pivoting back to russia why would they be doing that lisa booth our economy is the envy of the world hard to believe but if nancy pelosi had put our great trade deal with mexico and canada usmca up for a vote long ago our economy would be even better if she doesn't move quickly it will collapse the united states will not rest until we bring every american wrongfully detained in iran and around the world back home to their loved ones  taken during the obama administration despite $150 billion gift returned during the trump administration thank you to iran on a very fair negotiation see we can make a deal together  while the world is not doing well economically our country is doing better perhaps than it has ever done before jobs jobs jobs read the transcripts also see where i say us our country as opposed to me meaning me and where i then say that the attorney general of the united states will call you people still remember schiff's made up and fraudulent version of my conversation witch hunt why is the world bank loaning money to china can this be possible

and wounded in the attack that took place in pensacola florida just received a full briefing on the tragic shooting at nas pensacola in florida and spoke to  my thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families during this difficult time we are continuing to monitor the situation as the investigation is ongoing without the horror show that is the radical left do nothing democrats the stock markets and economy would be even better if that is possible and the border would be closed to the evil of drugs gangs and all other problems   this seems personal that it is deeply unfair that has not changed this has become a matter of their unhinged emotional reaction to a man who has bettered them who has had victory where they have not had victory and has exposed the problem with the leftists this is a blowout look at these manufacturing numbers a blowout   this is the best number i've ever seen in my life great jobs report stock markets up record numbers for this year alone

any other subject only accept information if it has an actual living name on it the fake news media makes up many sources say stories do not believe them where's the fake whistleblower where's whistleblower number 2 where's the phony informer who got it all wrong the story today that we are sending 12000 troops to saudi arabia is false or to put it more accurately fake news republican approval rating = 95percent thank you nancy pelosi just had a nervous fit she hates that we will soon have 182 great new judges and sooo much more stock market and employment records she says she prays for the president i don't believe her not even close help the homeless in your district nancy usmca thank you 🇺🇸  this will mean that the beyond important and seldom used act of impeachment will be used routinely to attack future presidents that is not what our founders had in mind the good thing is that the republicans have never been more united we will win the do nothing radical left democrats have just announced that they are going to seek to impeach me over nothing they already gave up on the ridiculous mueller stuff so now they hang their hats on two totally appropriate perfect phone calls with the ukrainian president trial in the senate and so that our country can get back to business we will have schiff the bidens pelosi and many more testify and will reveal for the first time how corrupt our system really is i was elected to clean the swamp and that's what i am doing the do nothing democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the house they have no impeachment

us on my nato trip proudly for our country no president has ever achieved so much in so little time without a us increase other countries have already increased by $130 billion-with $400 billion soon such a thing has never been done before i would like to have the attorney general of the united states call you or your people this based on what i have seen is their big point and it is no point at a all except for a big win for me the democrats should apologize to the american people when i said in my phone call to the president of ukraine i would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and ukraine knows a lot about it with the word us i am referring to the united states our country i then went on to say that just read the best maureen dowd column in the new york times ever although she treated me great before politics but it was written by her brother kevin someone in the news media should hire her wonderful talented and very smart brother   has

lawyers for their impeachment hoax they will need them the republicans get one oh that sounds fair when the law enforcers turn out to be the law breakers then we have totally upended the rule of law nobody is safe and everybody is in trouble our system of government is under attack   the democrats don't have any evidence but they are still going to do it anyway that's the sham that's going on here   chaffetz breaking news the president of ukraine has just again announced that president trump has done nothing wrong with respect to ukraine and our interactions or calls if the radical left democrats were sane which they are not it would be case over the united states has outperformed the rest of the world in an eye popping fashion i don't think we've seen numbers like that mohamed el-erian allianz chief economic adviser but despite this there is tremendous potential for growth far greater than most have understood the american people are going to see this for what it is it is a political effort by the democrats and the president certainly doesn't have to aid in the impeachment effort robert ray   democrats are getting killed in their home districts 2020 the process has been unfair republicans can't even get their own witnesses it gets me that adam schiff is not punishable for lying in any way  us markets are up as much as 21percent since the announcement of tariffs on 3/1/2018 and the us is taking in massive amounts of money and giving some to our farmers who have been targeted by china reserve should likewise act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies this makes it very hard for our manufactures  farmers to fairly export their goods lower rates  loosen fed brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers therefore effective immediately i will restore the tariffs on all steel  aluminum that is shipped into the us from those countries the federal it is clear that there is none of the bipartisan support that speaker pelosi said for months was essential for impeachment chris wallace  trump economy breaks holiday shopping records  great writer and historian doug wead has written a true not fake news account of what is going on in washington and the white house his new book inside trump's white house is an incredible description of a very exciting and successful time in our country's history buy it donald trump was framed back in 2016   100percent correct maria and we can never let

another president lawyer has already stated that i did nothing wrong john bolton is a patriot and may know that i held back the money from ukraine because it is considered a corrupt country  i wanted to know why nearby european countries weren't putting up money also likewise i would the dc wolves and fake news media are reading far too much into people being forced by courts to testify before congress i am fighting for future presidents and the office of the president other than that i would actually like people to testify don mcgahn's respected when the military rips down an old  badly broken border wall in an important location  replaces it with a brand new 30 ft high steel  concrete wall nancy pelosi says we are not building a wall wrong and it is going up fast brandon judd just gave us great marks  i will always protect our great warfighters i've got your backs great job heather  poll shows dems losing interest in impeachment inquiry all across the board these polls are

slammed on impeachment it is getting less and less popular by the day   support for impeachment is dropping like a rock down into the 20's in some polls dems should now get down to work and finally

norway ken braithwaite will be nominated by me to be the new secretary of the navy a man of great achievement and success i know ken will do an outstanding job contracting procedures were not addressed to my satisfaction therefore secretary of the navy richard spencer's services have been terminated by secretary of defense mark esper i thank richard for his service  commitment eddie will retire peacefully with all of the i was not pleased with the way that navy seal eddie gallagher's trial was handled by the navy he was treated very badly but despite this was completely exonerated on all major charges i then restored eddie's rank likewise large cost overruns from past administration's democrats going back to their districts for thanksgiving are getting absolutely hammered by their constituents over the phony impeachment scam republicans will have a great  election the whole russia thing was a hoax and the ukraine thing is a hoax and the democrats are a joke this is a disaster for them   the do nothing democrats are hurting our country and they don't care the impeachment scam is driving republican poll numbers up up up thank you shifty this is a great and well reseached book on justice k the ruth marcus book is a badly written  reseached disaster so many incorrect facts fake news just like the   witch hunt  but i did nothing wrong read the transcripts 2  100percent correct  agnes your great boy ronald is looking down very proud of you  exclusive elise stefanik reflects on her two-week whirlwind  the unspoken truth what impeachment exposed about trump and 2020  this is the real story behind the do nothing democrats  too bad we didn't have the g-7 here i offered to pick up the entire cost would have saved at least $35000000 for the usa best location very stupid people thought i would gain wrong looking at camp david will announce soon  polls have now turned very strongly against impeachment especially in swing states 75percent to 25percent thank you nancy pelosi adam schiff aoc and the rest of the democrats are not getting important legislation done hence the do nothing democrats usmca national defense authorization act gun safety prescription drug prices  infrastructure are dead in the water because of the dems navy seal eddie gallagher will be on  this morning at 7:30 am have no fear all will end well for everyone pushed hard to have apple build in usa  95percent approval rate in the republican party a record thank you thank you kevin for the nice words  sondland said trump told him none of this will move the needle for anyone and now dems in swing districts head home for thanksgiving to hear from voters pelosi  co are putting on a show to appease the democratic base instead of doing the work all americans need done any direct evidence that president trump did anything impeachable no one heard him order a quid pro quo no one offered a convincing reason why trump's interest in having ukraine probe potential cortuption warrants impeachment i want no quid pro quo ambassador new york post editorial worse than pointless all those hours of televised testimony plainly failed on their announced goal to change american's minds part of the problem is that democrats already leaked the best evidence they had more important not one witness offered daniel cameron who just won the ag race in the great commonwealth of kentucky is a young and very talented political star you will be hearing much from cameron in the years to come brennan too and the whistleblower also worked for susan rice it's an understatement to say that this is a witch hunt   they spied on my campaign the democrats dirty tricks have started this whole thing the whistleblower the guy who took his case to schiff's staff first is what really blows the lid off this entire saga he worked for biden on ukraine policy when biden was vp he worked for deep state henchman john joe concha the hill in emerson college poll impeachment among independents 49percent oppose 34percent support you see why pelosi is reluctant to go in with this dems have to go home and explain why they haven't done something on opioid crisis drug prices usmca the border etc adam schiff will be compelled to testify should the democrats decide despite the fact that my presidential conversations were totally appropriate perfect to go forward with the impeachment hoax polls have now turned very strongly against impeachment sondland said trump told him none of this will move the needle for anyone and now dems in swing districts head home for thanksgiving to hear from voters pelosi  co are putting on a show to appease the democratic base instead if doing the work all americans need done daniel cameron who just won the ag race in the great commonwealth of kentucky is a young and very talented political star you will be hearing much from cameron in the yesrs to come the support for impeachment is not there i think the democrats will have to come up with a new game plan   house republicans are showing real leadership and prepared to enact bipartisan solutions for drug prices do nothing democrats are playing partisan politics with your drug prices we are ready to work together if they actually want to get something done pelosi and her do nothing democrats drug pricing bill doesn't do the trick fewer cures fewer treatments time for the democrats to get serious about bipartisan solutions to lowering prescription drug prices for families while we had the first prescription drug price decrease in 50 years americans still pay far too much for drugs  other countries pay far less  that is wrong we will soon be putting more options on the table  and i will soon release a plan to let florida and other states import prescription drugs that are much cheaper than what we have now hard-working americans don't deserve to pay such high prices for the drugs they need we are fighting daily to make sure this happens thank you to  mitch mcconnell and  kevin mccarthy for their great leadership there has never been so much unity and spirit in the republican party as there is right now i will be interviewed on  this morning at 8:00 am i know that there's not much to talk about but we will try to keep the conversation going enjoy    former fbi employee accused of altering fisa documents hello here we go  rt  schiff's fact witnesses  thank you  and  great job  mark levin on impeachment hysteria  schiff's charade   schiff's fact witnesses  they want zero transparency thinking the world will not find out the death and tragedy that the iranian regime is causing iran has become so unstable that the regime has shut down their entire internet system so that the great iranian people cannot talk about the tremendous violence taking place within the country president trump said the ukraine president should just do the right thing no quid pro quo you shouldn't charge but you cannot convict a sitting president on the basis of conflicting and ambiguous evidence and destabilize the american government thank you ken ken starr former independent counsel does this reach the level of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors my assessment of the evidence so far no where close the evidence is conflicting  ambiguous ambassador sondland's testimony stated that i have been watching people making phone calls my entire life my hearing is and has been great never have i been watching a person making a call which was not on speakerphone and been able to hear or understand a conversation i've even tried but to no avail try it live read the two transcripts of ukrainian calls the navy will not be taking away warfighter and navy seal eddie gallagher's trident pin this case was handled very badly from the beginning get back to business nothing gives schiff jurisdiction over impeachment the new house resolution gives adam schiff the most dishonest man in politics the power unilaterally to release edited transcripts rule 10 gives chairman schiff absolutely no jurisdiction subpoenas issued as part of dems' impeachment inquiry are illegal sam dewey  but we are winning big and they will soon be on our turf corrupt politician adam schiff's lies are growing by the day keep fighting tough republicans you are dealing with human scum who have taken due process and all of the republican party's rights away from us during the most unfair hearings in american history i never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word impeachment the calls transcripts were perfect there was nothing said that was wrong no pressure on ukraine great corruption  dishonesty by schiff on the other side freed taliban hostages arrive in germany      we got them back president before what they are doing is not legal but i'm clean and when i release my financial statement my decision sometime prior to election it will only show one thing that i am much richer than people even thought and that is a good thing jobs jobs jobs bob mueller after spending two years and 45 million dollars went over all of my financials  my taxes and found nothing now the witch hunt continues with local new york democrat prosecutors going over every financial deal i have ever done this has never happened to a the republican party and me had a great day yesterday with respect to the phony impeachment hoax  yet when i got home to the white house  checked out the news coverage on much of television you would have no idea they were reporting on the same event fake  corrupt news during my visit yesterday to austin texas for the startup of the new mac pro  the discussion of a new one $billion campus also in texas i asked tim cook to see if he could get apple involved in building 5g in the us they have it all money technology vision  cookl why do    waste airtime on democrat rep eric swalwell who recently left the presidential primaries having attained a grand number of zero in the polls i don't even know how that is possible fox should stay with the people that got them there not losers poll trump leads top 2020 democrats in wisconsin  all four of gordon sondland's lawyers are democrat donors   despite this big win today for republicans watch    big news  if this were a prizefight they'd stop it today i opened a major apple manufacturing plant in texas that will bring high paying jobs back to america today nancy pelosi closed congress because she doesn't care about american workers i want nothing  i want nothing i want nothing i want no quid pro quo tell president zelensky to do the right thing later ambassador sondland said that i told him good go tell the truth this witch hunt must end now so bad for our country impeachment witch hunt is now over ambassador sondland asks us president me what do you want from ukraine i keep hearing all these different ideas  theories what do you want it was a very abrupt conversation he was not in a good mood he the president just said we join families of kevin king  tim weeks in celebrating their release from taliban captivity thanks to president ghani for his courageous support let's hope this leads to more good things on the peace front like a ceasefire that will help end this long war proud of my team nancy pelosi will go down as the least productive speaker of the house in history she is dominated by aoc plus 3 and the radical left mexico and canada after waiting for 6 months to be approved are ready to flee and who can blame them too bad white house confidence grows as hearings wear on   this is just an attempted takedown of the republican party by the do nothing democrats it will never work  the three year hoax continues  true great job   read the transcripts  thank you tennessee  congressman van drew d-nj we've spent millions of dollars in my opinion tons of money tons of time tons of hurt fracturing the nation apart i haven't seen this to be a good thing rt  a new poll has independents opposing the impeachment of president  10percent more this is not working with th a great day for republicans a great day for our country i agree but in the end we will win and save our country from certain destruction  nasdaq up 27percent this year alone rt  this is what was asked today was there a bribe no did anybody ask you to bribe anyone no was there extortion no t nancy pelosi just stated that it is dangerous to let the voters decide trump's fate   in other words she thinks i'm going to win and doesn't want to take a chance on letting the voters decide like al green she wants to change our voting system wow she's crazy the do nothing democrats have disgraced our great country  at my meeting with jay powell this morning i protested fact that our fed rate is

finished a very good  cordial meeting at the white house with jay powell of the federal reserve everything was discused including interest rates negative interest low inflation easing dollar strength  its effect on manufacturing trade with china eu  others etc all they do is bring up witnesses who didn't witness anything    nothing matters except the two transcripts of the presidential calls and the statement of no pressure put out by ukraine the impeachment started before he even became president    where is the fake whistleblower republicans  others must remember the ukrainian president and foreign minister both said that there was no pressure placed on them whatsoever also they didn't even know the money wasn't paid and got the money with no conditions but why isn't germany france

and foreign minister of ukraine nervous nancy pelosi who should be home cleaning up the dangerous  disgusting slum she is making of her district in san francisco where even the ambassador sondland did not tell us and certainly did not tell me about a connection between the assistance and the investigation the fake impeachment inquiry is now dead democrats must apologize to usa ukrainian foreign

clarita california through our ongoing communications with local state and federal authorities where's the fake whistleblower that the house democrats have done since she's become speaker other than chase donald trump this impeachment hoax is such a bad precedent and sooo bad for our country anywhere so we've now had 3 years of the democrats chasing donald trump nancy pelosi's worried about the american voter looking for someone to blame for that eventually look at her own story in the house what have they done the average american can't identify anything   wsj nancy pelosi had it right the first time when she did not want to go down the impeachment path make it a voting issue but no the left insisted on raising this to the gravity of a constitutional crisis  impeachment the hearings suggested it's not going that hearing was about a policy dispute robert ray regular people watching this cannot conclude that the president of the united states can be impeached  neither one of the democrat star witnesses at the impeachment hearings could point out an impeachable offense that's the result    walmart announces great numbers no impact from tariffs which are contributing $billions to our treasury inflation low do you hear that powell hit new stock market record again yesterday the 20th time this year with great potential for the future usa is where the action is companies and jobs are coming back like never before  asked the two star witnesses where is the impeachable event in that call both stared straight ahead with a blank look on their face remained silent  were unable to answer the question that would be the end of a case run by normal people but not shifty wow was just told that my son's book triggered is number one on the new york times bestseller list congratulations don thank you  it is a time of shame for our country the democrats know what they are doing is wrong  read the transcript never trumpers any laws or did anything wrong and they have to move away from quid pro quo because there was no quid and there was no quo ukraine got it's money 3 weeks early and there was no investigation   the most powerful tool the legislative branch has impeachment  they've turned it into a political cudgel which is not at all what the founders intended when you hear schiff use all these words like quid pro quo it is because they can't specify that donald trump broke nancy pelosi cares more about power than she does about principle she did not want to go down this road she realizes this is a huge loser for democrats the founders envisioned the worst people being in politics yet they couldn't envision this you have these people taking the democrats have stacked the deck against president trump and the republicans they have leaked out everything   millions of americans will see what a partisan sham this whole thing is rush limbaugh   also why is corrupt politician schiff allowed to hand over cross examination to a high priced outside lawyer did that lawyer ever work for me which would be a conflict to hurt donald trump and we the people that support him the left has never accepted the results of the 2016 election they never saw this coming this is not just about president trump they hate everyone he is representing    sean the amazing warrior this is a phony showtrial there is zero due process none it is yet another fraudulent hoax conspiracy theory it is another witch hunt this is what the socialist doemocrat party has become there's not one thing the democrats have done in the past 3 years except try the circus is coming to town the corrupt compromised coward  congenital liar adam schiff show on capital hill brought to you by his raging psychotic democrats  the top allies in the media mob everything you're going to see in the next two weeks is rigged this ridiculous impeachment is a travesty it's not an inquiry just read the transcript  daca recipients with arrest records 53792 that is a very large proportion of the total   not good but we will be able to make a deal with the dems a total impeachment scam by the do nothing democrats  many of the people in daca no longer very young are far from angels some are very tough hardened criminals president obama said he had no legal right to sign order but would anyway if supreme court remedies with overturn a deal will be made with dems for them to stay economy is booming seems set to have yet another record day i will be releasing the transcript of the first and therefore more important phone call with the ukrainian president before week's end ukrainian energy company and more millions taken from china and now reports of other companies and countries also giving him big money are certainly looking very corrupt to put it mildly to me both bidens should be forced to testify in this no due process scam no pressure put on him to investigate sleepy joe biden even though as president i have an obligation to look into corruption and biden's actions on tape about firing the prosecutor and his son's taking millions of dollars with no knowledge or talent from a why is such a focus put on 2nd and 3rd hand witnesses many of whom are never trumpers or whose lawyers are never trumpers when all you have to do is read the phone call transcript with the ukrainian president and see first hand he and others also stated that there was a great try by  we are all proud of you vote for sean spicer on dancing with the stars he is a great and very loyal guy who is working very hard he is in the quarterfinals all the way with sean    this isn't about ukraine this isn't about impeachment this is about subverting democracy  so true and led by angry and dishonest people who hate themselves and must hate our country want that to be an impeachable offense good luck with that   the president has until september 30th to give this aid to ukraine he gets it out on september 11th 3 weeks before the deadline so we give our ally aid and joe biden is not investigated remember that they get the aid and we get nothing in return the democrats schiff and the dems have created this whole thing they reverse engineer it they've been vowing to impeach for three years why should we listen to them why should we want to    in order to continue being the most transparent president in history i will be releasing sometime this week the transcript of the first and therefore most important phone call i had with the president of ukraine i am sure you will find it tantalizing just like schiff fabricated my phone call he will fabricate the transcripts that he is making and releasing schiff is giving republicans no witnesses no lawyer  no due process it is a totally one sided witch hunt this can't be making the democrats look good such a farce read the transcript it is perfect to think i signed the whistleblower protection act  where is the whistleblower who gave so much false information must testify along with schiff and others today we come together as one nation to salute the veterans of the united states armed forces  the greatest warriors ever to walk on the face of the earth our veterans risked everything for us now it is our duty to serve and protect them every day of our lives  the chinese say about trump's trade war  tariffs ‘he brought us to the table' this is the most prosperous economy the world has ever seen and it's going to be a very prosperous economy jamie dimon on   thank you president trump  the republican party shifty adam schiff will only release doctored transcripts we haven't even seen the documents and are restricted from get this having a lawyer republicans should put out their own transcripts schiff must testify as to why he made up a statement from me and read it to all the lawyer for the whistleblower takes away all credibility from this big impeachment scam it should be ended and the whistleblower his lawyer and corrupt politician schiff should be investigared for fraud so with one rally by me at the end of the campaign i lift the poll numbers of kentucky governor matt bevin by 19 points he just misses every other republican in the commonwealth wins big and the fake news blames me for a bad night ok by the way mississippi won everything will be meeting with representatives of the vaping industry together with medical professionals and

showtrial indeed allowing a long drawn out trial in the senate would merely validate and perpetuate the fraud begun in the house the crisis is of the democrats own making and it's up to republicans to make sure this never happens the dems have selectively leaked nor was there any corrupt intent on the part of the president remember the president knew that that call was being heard and documented by many people anyone with intent would be a tad more discreet don't you think this farce should now is the time for republicans to stand together and defend the leader of their party against these smears it would be one thing if there were any indication of an underlying crime but there is not-not in the transcripts and not in the secret witness testimony that congratulations to the washington nationals on a great season and an incredible world series game 7 was amazing  thank you daily wire very cute recreation but the live version of conan will be leaving the middle east for the white house sometime next week  the do nothing democrats have gone crazy very bad for usa  the democrats have been on this path for 3 years the first headline i sawbefore the president was sworn in was that

unfairly by the democrats because he is doing an unbelievable job and fulfilling every one of his promises now they are trying to recall him because his agenda is the economy jobs and protecting the united states military congress needs to do its work we need to fund our armed forces   mitch mcconnell  the dems are a lost cause in 2020 we need a big beautiful win all three  our country cannot afford for the democrats in congress to take a one year vacation from any productive legislation just because they would rather obsess over impeachment isis  other radical terrorists are not going to hit the pause button because democrats won't fund precisely the same program that the democrats are trying to  impeach president trump for supposedly slow walking tomorrow right here in the senate they the dems say they're going to filibuster for the exact same program  mitch mcconnell do nothing democrats yesterday's never trumper witness could find no quid pro quo in the transcript of the phone call there were many people listening to the call how come they including the president of ukraine found nothing wrong with it witch hunt a federal judge is allowing the nick sandman libel suit to move forward against the thoroughly disgusting washington post which is no longer available at the white house he could now have a good chance of winning go nick it does appear it has to do with nancy pelosi retaining her speakership in the next congress she would like that so she's going to put it to a vote because that's what her political left really wants    a disgraceful use of impeachment will backfire the greatest economy in american history the call with the ukrainian president was a totally appropriate one as he said no pressure this impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the witch hunt hoax which has been going on since before i even got elected rupublicans go with substance and close it out republicans are very unified and energized in our fight on the impeachment hoax with the do nothing democrats and now  are starting to go after the substance even more than the very infair process because just a casual reading of the transcript leads everybody to see that nervous nancy pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the republican party our polls show that it is going to be just the opposite the do nothing dems will lose many seats in 2020 they have a death wish led by a corrupt politician adam schiff over in europe and japan they have negative rates they get paid to borrow money don't we have to follow our competitors   yes we do the fed doesn't have a clue we have unlimited potential only held back by the federal reserve but we are winning anyway consumer confidence number very good housing sales in september up nicely economy rocks a great new book just out the plot against the president the true story of how congressman devin nunez uncovered the biggest political scandal in us history shows very bad and corrupt

that i was can't be possible please ask him to read the transcript of the call witch hunt how many more never trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is read the transcript i knew people were listening in on the call why would i say something inappropriate which was fine with me but why so many the do nothing democrats are working hard to make everyone forget the best economy ever the monumental weekend raid tax cuts the rebuilding of our military etc the impeachment hoax is a disgrace read the transcript where's the whistleblower just read the transcript everything else is made up garbage by shifty schiff and the never trumpers a great book by a great guy get it now  correct a total scam  why are people that i never even heard of testifying about the call just read the call transcript and the impeachment hoax is over ukrain said no pressure  this is a big win for america and also for president trump  the only crimes in the impeachment hoax were committed by shifty adam schiff when he totally made up my phone conversation with the ukrainian president and read it to congress together with numerous others on shifty's side schiff should be impeached and worse there is no underlying crime in that transcript   100percent correct and the whistleblower disappeared after i released the transcript of the call where is the whistleblower that is why this is now called the impeachment hoax the do nothing dems are doing nothing americans know by now that the impeachment inquiry is just another hoax

nervous nancy pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the republican party our polls show that it is going to be just the oppidite the do nothing dems will lose many seats in 2020 they have a death wish led by a corrupt politician adam schiff can you believe that shifty adam schiff the biggest leaker in dc and a corrupt politician is upset that we didn't inform him before we raided and killed the  terrorist in the world wouldn't be surprised if the do nothing democrats impeach me over that drain the swamp so nice thank you  we have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog name

made up what i said on the call we should all work together to clean up these hazardous waste and homeless sites before the whole city rots away very bad and dangerous conditions also severely impacting the pacific ocean and water supply pelosi must work on this mess and turn her district around i can't believe that nancy pelosi's district in san francisco is in such horrible shape that the city itself is in violation of many sanitary  environmental orders causing it to owe the federal government billions of dollars and all she works on is impeachment not a single american citizen has been charged with anything related to russian collusion not one person   it was all an illegal witch hunt had a beautiful dinner last night at camp david in celebration of the 10th wedding anniversary of ivanka and jared attended by a small number of family and friends it could not have been nicer camp david is a special place cost of the event will be totally paid for by me thank you  hopefully this is just the beginning of a massive story of injustice and treason you will never learn this from the corrupt lamestream media who get pulitzer prizes for reporting the story totally wrong the ones who report it right get only respect the president when flynn had been cleared of everything long before that the doj is withholding a lot of evidence  information as are clapper  brennan  all of the people who participated in the complete setup of michael flynnterrible sidney powell this is a disgrace they exonerated him completely of being an agent of russia recently crooked hillary charged tulsi gabbard  jill stein with the same thing-sick and yet mr comey still runs to the white house on february 14 and conjures up the obstruction of justice narrative against general michael flynn's attorney is demanding that charges be immediately dropped after they found that fbi agents manipulated records against him they say that james clapper told a reporter to take a kill shot at flynn this has been a complete setup of michael flynn my administration is fighting hard to end the opioid crisis join with us by disposing unused or expired prescription medications at over 4000 locations

thank you   great book  wow  my lawyers should sue the democrats and shifty adam schiff for fraud the entire impeachment scam was based on my perfect ukrainian call and the whistleblowers account of that call which turned out to be false a fraud once i released the actual call their entire case fell apart the democrats must end this scam now witch hunt democrats just announced that they no longer want the whistleblower to testify but everything was about the whistleblower they no longer want the second whistleblower either which they don't want because the account of my call bore no relationship to the call itself to tim the button on the iphone was far better than the swipe in the basement of the united states capitol they cannot win at the ballot box their sham for the past 3 years continues the good news is that the american people get it which will be proven once again on november 3 2020 i appreciate the support of senator   mitch mcconnell and their great senate republican colleagues on the resolution condemning the do nothing democrats for their witch hunt impeachment inquiry behind closed doors it was my great honor to deliver the keynote address at the 2019 second step presidential justice forum hosted by the 20/20 bipartisan justice center in south carolina and my true honor to receive the bipartisan justice award thank you  thank you   heading to south carolina  donald j trump is an absolutely historic president already in less than 3 years in office his record is there for everyone to look at  to examine and compare this is an illegitimate effort to overthrow a president not a formal impeachment inquiry   thank you lou coming home we were supposed to be there for 30 days that was 10 years ago when these pundit fools who have called the middle east wrong for 20 years ask what we are getting out of the deal i simply say the oil and we are bringing our soldiers back home isis secured usa has gained trillions of dollars in wealth since november 2016 all others way down our power is economic before having to use our newly rebuilt military a much better alternative oil is secured our soldiers have left and are leaving syria for other places then turkey fully understands not to fire on the kurds as they leave what will be known as the safe zone for other fairly nearby areas i don't have to repeat that large scale sanctions will be imposed for violations going well isis secured by kurds with turkey ready as backup so congressman tim ryan of ohio has finally dropped out of the race for president registering zero in the polls  unable to even qualify for the debate stage see tim it's not so easy out there if you don't know what you're doing he wasn't effective for usa workers just talk another big dropout of the presidential race was along with 0percent tim ryan 0percent  such talk and bravado from both and nothing to show they stood for nothing and the voters couldn't stand by them obnoxious and greedy politicians never make it in the end rt  today  is receiving the bipartisan justice award for his historic work on criminal justice reformat the sa rt  let's call this sham what it really is an  against  purely political proce where is the whistleblower and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the ukrainian president why did the ig allow this to happen who is the so-called informant schiff who was so inaccurate a giant scam i really enjoyed my conversation with general  he appreciates what we have done and i appreciate what the kurds have done perhaps it is time for the kurds to start heading to the oil region the oil fields discussed in my speech on turkey/kurds yesterday were held by isis until the united states took them over with the help of the kurds we will never let a reconstituted isis have those fields thank you to house republicans for being tough smart and understanding in detail the greatest witch hunt in american history it has been going on since long before i even got elected the insurance policy a total scam the federal reserve is derelict in its duties if it doesn't lower the rate and even ideally stimulate take a look around the world at our competitors germany and others are  actually getting paid to borrow money fed was way too fast to raise and way too slow to cut don't hurt them please  it is the only thing the do nothing dems are doing  just a continuation of the witch hunt  kiddingly we're building a wall in coloradothen stated we're not building a wall in kansas but they get the benefit of the wall we're building on the border refered to people in the very packed auditorium from colorado  kansas getting the benefit of the border wall rt    promises made promises kept   it was wonderful to be back in pittsburgh pennsylvania with the incredible patriots who fuel our factories light up our homes power our industries and fill our hearts with true american pride   it would be really great if the people within the trump administration all well-meaning and good i hope could stop hiring never trumpers who are worse than the do nothing democrats nothing good will ever come from them does anybody think this is fair even though there was no quid pro quo i'm sure they would like to try worse than the dems never trumper republican john bellinger represents never trumper diplomat bill taylor who i don't know in testimony before congress do nothing democrats allow republicans zero representation zero due process and zero transparency the never trumper republicans though on respirators with not many left are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our country than the do nothing democrats watch out for them they are human scum thank you general mazloum for your kind words and courage

combat missions have ended kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us captured isis prisoners secured i will be making a statement at 11:00 am from the white house thank you feel empowered there's a movement happening on these campuses like i've never seen before when you have 3000 students wanting to get into an event that couldn't get in that's pretty remarkable   turning point usa   keep america great order a couple of months ago saying that any school that does not uphold the first amendment rights of its students will lose federal funding we have seen a huge change in how the universities interact with us as a national  local student organization our studends young campus conservatives are flocking to turning point usa  other conservative speaker events all over the country and in record numbers thousands of students are turning out i just want to compliment the president of the united states for signing that historic executive republicans are going to fight harder than ever to win back the house because of what the do nothing democrats have done to our country neither he taylor or any other witness has provided testimony that the ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld you can't have a quid pro quo with no quo congressman john ratcliffe  where is the whistleblower the do nothing dems case is dead it never ends the do nothing dems are terrible  thank you steve  the democrats scam goes on and on they do nothing  the witch hunt continues  the do nothing dems have nothing but time  wrong never even discussed this with kellyanne conway or steve mnuchin just more fake news  wrong never even discussed this with kellyanne conway ot steve mnuchin just more fake news  good news seems to be happening with respect to turkey syria and the middle east further reports to come later great job tim  the democrats are trying to draw out this inquiry because they don't have the support donald trump is guilty only of winning the 2016 election   can't believe that nervous nancy pelosi isn't moving faster on usmca her people want it they don't know why she isn't putting it up for a bipartisan vote taking too long 95percent approval rating in the republican party thank you thank you republicans 185 out of 185 present voted for us last night really good so some day if a democrat becomes president and the republicans win the house even by a tiny margin they can impeach the president without due process or fairness or any legal rights all republicans must remember what they are witnessing here a lynching but we will win    i want to know about hillary clinton with the dossier i want to know if there was fisa abuse we're still waiting for that report    a majority do not want him impeached and removed from office 94percent of the people in these battleground states who voted for president trump want him to continue as president that's squarely in his corner  that's a revealing poll don't you think that matters i thought a very revealing poll was done by the new york times by about a 10 point margin those in battleground states polled are against impeaching the president and if nancy pelosi doesn't take note of that maybe she is the third rate politician   the ambassador to the european union has already testified he said there was no quid pro quo he said the president had told him that    congratulations to  on a wonderful and hard fought victory canada is well served i look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries thank you liz shows great republican support  thank you dan and kevin great vote  will be interviewed by  tonight at 9:00 pm on  enjoy doral in miami would have been the best place to hold the g-7 and free but too much heat from the do nothing radical left democrats  their partner the fake news media i'm surprised that they allow me to give up my $400000 plus presidential salary we'll find someplace else censure at least corrupt adam schiff after what he got caught doing any pol who does not so vote cannot be honestare you listening dems great new book by wonderful and very street smart author dan bongino exonerated the failed takedown of president donald trump by the swamp dan hits all of the crooked points of the greatest witch hunt in political history nevertheless the scam continues thank you john so nice  rt  they still pretend they cannot see all of this  the are hypocrites we know keep up with the good work you have my a great democrat scam  adam schiff is a corrupt politician  congratulations barbara  to the democrats impeachment is partisan politics dressed up as principle   so interesting that when i announced trump national doral in miami would be used for the hosting of the g-7 and then rescinded due to do nothing democrat/fake news anger very few in media mentioned that no profits would be taken or would be given free if legally permissible fiction to congress and the american people  i demand his deposition he is a fraud just like the russia hoax was and the ukraine hoax is now when do the do nothing democrats pay a price for what they are doing to our country  when do the republicans finally fight back because their so-called story didn't come even close to matching up with the exact transcript of the phone call was it a corrupt adam schiff con why didn't the ig see this when do we depose shifty schiff to find out why he fraudulently made up my phone call and read this this scam going on right now by the democrats against the republican party and me was all about a perfect phone call i had with the ukrainian president he's already stated no pressure where is the whistleblower or the 2nd whistleblower or the informant all gone pelosi is now leading a delegation of 9 including corrupt adam schiff to jordan to check out syria she should find out why obama drew the red line in the sand  then did nothing losing syria  all respect i did something 58 missiles one million died under obama's mistake the ceasefire is holding up very nicely there are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly new areas being resettled with kurds us soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zone we have secured the oil mark esper secretary of defense ending endless wars the wall is making a very big difference even dems in area are happy  so now crooked hillary is at it again she is calling congresswoman tulsi gabbard a russian favorite and jill stein a russian asset as you may have heard i was called a big russia lover also actually i do like russian people i like all people hillary's gone crazy never give up we are doing great we are winning  therefore based on both media  democrat crazed and irrational hostility we will no longer consider trump national doral miami as the host site for the g-7 in 2020 we will begin the search for another site including the possibility of camp david immediately thank you its own 50 to 70 unit building would set up better than other alternatives i announced that i would be willing to do it at no profit or if legally permissible at zero cost to the usa but as usual the hostile media  their democrat partners went crazy i thought i was doing something very good for our country by using trump national doral in miami for hosting the g-7 leaders it is big grand on hundreds of acres next to miami international airport has tremendous ballrooms  meeting rooms and each delegation would have mark esperanto secretary of defense the ceasefire is holding up very nicely there are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly new areas being resettled with the kurds usa soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zones we have secured the oil bringing soldiers home the president never told me to withhold any money until the ukrainians did anything related to the server the only reason we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption yesterday's mick mulvaney statement see you there  crooked hillary clinton just called the respected environmentalist and green party candidate jill stein a russian asset they need a green party more than ever after looking at the democrats disastrous environmental program it is only about this  just another fake suppression poll this time from  of course    thank you tom great interview on   a great book by kimberley strassel  i don't see anything that constitutes an impeachable offense nothing here rises to the level of impeachment the democrats are making a mistake with this secrecy kenn starr former special prosecutor thank you very much working hard  i agree  texas is great  there has never been a greater fraud on congress shifty schiff is corrupt go andy  such a disgrace that the do nothing democrats are doing just as their name suggests doing nothing usmca anyone  rt  free beacon reminds us of lefty double standard between brewer pelosi finger wags  susan rice who was a disaster to president obama as national security advisor is now telling us her opinion on what to do in syria remember red line in the sand that was obama millions killed no thanks susan you were a disaster pelosi and impeachment there have already been 3 votes and they've all failed miserably here's why there may not be a fourth 137 democrats voted against on the last vote     many of those voting in favor will be beaten in 2020 congressman michael mccaul schiff's inquiry defies democracy   because the house has already voted against the impeachment proceeding the current inquiry is totally invalid the current sham of a so-called investigation is nothing more than an unconstitutional power grab it needs to end      corrupt adam schiff corrupt congressman adam schiff is angry that ambassadors that he thought would be good for his fraudulent witch hunt are turning out to be good for me some really good he's got all meetings locked down no transparency only his illegal leaks a very dishonest sleazebag republicans must stick together and fight  think of how many lives we saved in syria and turkey by getting a ceasefire yesterday thousands and thousands and maybe many more he is also my friend at the same time i am pleased to nominate deputy secretary dan brouillette to be the new secretary of energy dan's experience in the sector is unparalleled a total professional i have no doubt that dan will do a great job i want to thank secretary of energy rick perry for the outstanding job he has done he will be leaving at the end of the year to pursue other interests rick was a great governor of texas and a great secretary of energy can you believe i am doing this important work for our country and have to deal with corrupt adam schiff and the do nothing democrats at the same time it was not intended to be this way for a president defeat terrorism  i have just been notified that some european nations are now willing for the first time to take the isis fighters that came from their nations this is good news but should have been done after we captured them anyway big progress being made this thinking years ago instead it was always held together with very weak bandaids  in an artificial manner there is good will on both sides  a really good chance for success the us has secured the oil  the isis fighters are double secured by kurds  turkey just spoke to president  of turkey he told me there was minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated he very much wants the ceasefire or pause to work likewise the kurds want it and the ultimate solution to happen too bad there wasn't the usa  democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism and blatant corruption the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and the american dream   tonight we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the democrat party the fake news media and the rogue bureaucrats of the deep state the only message these radicals will understand is a crushing defeat on november 3 2020   the radical left tolerates no dissent it permits no opposition it accepts no compromise and it has absolutely no respect for the will of the american people they are coming after me because i am fighting for you    thank you dallas texas i love you    just arrived at the american airlines center in dallas texas will be out

of our troops  bring them home from the ridiculous  costly endless wars and be scorned democrats always liked that position until i took it democrats always liked walls until i built them do you see what's happening here about 500000 human beings were killed in syria while barack obama was president  leading for a political settlement to that civil war media has been more outraged in the last 72 hours over our syria policy than they were at any point during 7 years of slaughter bucksexton rt  voters are rejecting the dems' baseless obstruction  socialist agenda and they're making their voices heard loud  clear su hope all house republicans and honest house democrats will vote to censure rep adam schiff tomorrow for his brazen and unlawful act of fabricating making up a totally phony conversation with the ukraine president and us president me most have never seen such a thing years of bad government such a sorry thing to see  what has happened here with the anthony wiener laptop

independence  not government coercion domination  control we were born free and will stay free as long as i am your president republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this impeachment witch

any of those clowns became president 95percent approval rating in the republican party thank you just won two congressional seats in north carolina   a governors runoff in louisiana which republicans should now win because of impeachment fraud we will easily take back the house add in the senate  again win pres what is happening to president trump with impeachment is a constitutional travesty   the likes of which we have never seen before it is adam schiff and nancy pelosi who should be impeached for fraud you would think there is no way that any of the democrat candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become president of the united states now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal  absurd impeachment of one of the most successful presidents we now have the greatest economy in history  a great group of champions  looks good to me   it also brings shifty's fraudulent made up call which he read to the united states congress pretending it to be the words of president trump which they were not nancy pelosi is involved in this fraud in that she confirmed his fraudulent words on  and much more shifty adam schiff wants to rest his entire case on a whistleblower who he now says can't testify  the reason he can't testify is that he is afraid to do so because his account of the presidential telephone call is a fraud  totally different from the actual transcribed call the  amazing comeback reminds us to never give up  and never lose faith when you work hard support each other believe in yourself and give it everything you've got victory is always within reach   congratulations   now that we have found out that  is a virtual fraud rumor has it that jeff zucker will be resigining momentarily join me in dallas texas this thursday october

problems reminds me of crooked hillary and her 33000 deleted emails not recoverable democrats are allowing no transparency at the witch hunt hearings if republicans ever did this they would be excoriated by the fake news let the facts come out from the charade of people most of whom i do not know they are interviewing for 9 hours each not selective leaks shifty schiff now seems to think they don't need the whistleblower who started the whole scam the reason is that the whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the transcrpt also the second whistleblower is no longer even mentioned project veritas-obtained undercover videos highlight jeff zucker's  campaign to destroy trump videos reveal  bias   does this sound like a good or even great lawsuit a big scandal at  news they got caught using really gruesome fake footage of the turks bombing in syria a real disgrace tomorrow they will ask softball questions to sleepy joe biden's son hunter like why did ukraine  china pay you millions when you knew nothing payoff shifty schiff now seems to think they don't need the whistleblower who started the whole scam the reason is that the whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the transcript also the second whistleblower is no longer even mentioned the house gone rogue i want to remind you a little bit about the ring leader in this whole rogue operation against the president of the united states   it doesn't speak for the full house because the full house hasn't spoken the democrat party is pushing this impeachment this is a democrat party impeachment as i have been saying a silent coup effort   the democrat party has hijacked the house of representatives   statement from president donald j trump regarding turkey's actions in northeast syria  i would much rather focus on our southern border which abuts and is part of the united states of america and by the way numbers are way down and the wall is being built some people want the united states to protect the 7000 mile away border of syria presided over by bashar al-assad our enemy at the same time syria and whoever they chose to help wants naturally to protect the kurds and assad to protect the land of our enemy anyone who wants to assist syria in protecting the kurds is good with me whether it is russia china or napoleon bonaparte i hope they all do great we are 7000 miles away after defeating 100percent of the isis caliphate i largely moved our troops out of syria let syria and assad protect the kurds and fight turkey for their own land i said to my generals why should we be fighting for syria don't the europeans have a lot of responsibility  thank you katie i offered isis prisoners to the european countries from where they came and was rejected on numerous occasions they probably figured that the us would bear the tremendous cost as always to his credit the europeans didn't step up to deal with this isis problem  it's a lot of the reason why we are in this situation today now angela merkel of germany is finally stepping up and telling turkey to back off great new book resistance at all costs how trump haters are breaking america out by kimberley strassel of the wall street journal kim has treated us fairly and for that i am very appreciative check it out today it is great of the correction which they knew about full well fox news pollster braun research misrepresented impeachment poll analysis  the fox impeachment poll has turned out to be incorrect this was announced on friday despite this the corrupt new york times used this poll in one of its stories no mention america first wow hunter biden is being forced to leave a chinese company now watch the fake news wrap their greasy and very protective arms around him only softball questions of him please will be looking into the scott hapgood case and the island of anguilla something looks and sounds very wrong i know anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved     vote for good guy  tonight on dancing with the stars he has always been there for us happy columbus day the same people who got us into the middle east mess are the people who most want to stay there kurds may be releasing some to get us involved easily recaptured by turkey or european nations from where many came but they should move quickly big sanctions on turkey coming do people really think we should go to war with nato member turkey never ending wars will end brian kilmeade over at  got it all wrong we are not going into another war between people who have been fighting with each other for 200 years europe had a chance to get their isis prisoners but didn't want the cost let the usa pay they said former democrat senator harry reid just stated that donald trump is very smart much more popular than people think is underestimated and will be hard to beat in the 2020 election thank you harry i agree democrat's game was foiled when we caught schiff fraudulently making up my ukraine conversation when i released the exact conversation transcript and when ukrainian president and the foreign minister said there was no pressure very normal talk a total impeachment scam adam schiff now doesn't seem to want the whistleblower to testify no must testify to explain why he got my ukraine conversation sooo wrong not even close did schiff tell him to do that we must determine the whistleblower's identity to determine why this was done to the usa the democrats are trashing this president  in the process trashing the us constitution frankly the american people need to wake up to the reality that the democrats are so drunk on power that they're willing to destroy this constitutional republic   serial killers get more due process than the democrats give to the president of the united states  somebody please explain to chris wallace of fox who will never be his father and my friend mike wallace that the phone conversation i had with the president of ukraine was a congenial  good one it was only schiff's made up version of that conversation that was bad the us has the worst of the isis prisoners turkey and the kurds must not let them escape europe should have taken them back after numerous requests they should do it now they will never come to or be allowed in the united states  on  is doing a big show tonight on the democrat's impeachment scam 10:00 pm no guests just mark he is angry like so many others at 9:00 pm on  steve hilton is looking into the crooked bidens where's hunter by the way don't call me again i'll call you when you've done what i've asked' a reminder that wasn't just stupid it was false     i never said this schiff made it up and read it to congress  the american people end witch hunt congressman adam schiff who when seeing the real ukraine phone call transcript decided he'd better make up one of his own ‘i'm going to say this only seven times so you better listen good i want you to make up dirt on my political opponent understand lots of it and china has already begun agricultural purchases from our great patriot farmers  ranchers i agreed not to increase tariffs from 25percent to 30percent on october 15th they will remain at 25percent the relationship with china is very good we will finish out the large phase one part of the deal then head directly into phase two the phase one deal can be finalized  signed soon my deal with china is that they will immediately start buying very large quantities of our agricultural product not wait until the deal is signed over the next 3 or 4 weeks they have already started likewise financial services and other deal aspects start preparing the democrats are going to lose a lot of house seats because of their fraudulent use of impeachment schiff fabricated phone call a crime democrat senate seats will also be put at risk even some that were supposedly safe look at louisiana last night north carolina last week happy birthday   we have become a far greater economic power than ever before and we are using that power for world peace where's hunter he has totally disappeared now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries media is awol dealing with  and many members of congress including democrats about imposing powerful sanctions on turkey treasury is ready to go additional legislation may be sought there is great consensus on this turkey has asked that it not be done stay tuned the kurds and turkey have been fighting for many years turkey considers the pkk the worst terrorists of all others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other let them we are monitoring the situation closely endless wars do you remember two years ago when iraq was going to fight the kurds in a different part of syria many people wanted us to fight with the kurds against iraq who we just fought for i said no and the kurds left the fight twice now the same thing is happening with turkey very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the turkish border for a change those that mistakenly got us into the middle east wars are still pushing to fight they have no idea what a bad decision they have made why are they not asking for a declaration of war the media is not talking about the big republican victory last night in louisiana where a sitting democrat governor was forced into a runoff by not getting 50percent big upset now  who will be a great governor will win a despicable human being  congratulations to the great state of louisiana a big night you will soon have a new and wonderful governor  your taxes and car insurance payments will go down the same people that got us into the middle east quicksand 8 trillion dollars and many thousands of lives and millions of lives when you count the other side are now fighting to keep us there don't listen to people that haven't got a clue they have proven to be inept the governor of louisiana john bel edwards has done a poor job now he is in a runoff with a great republican  thank you louisiana 66percent down to 47percent after i explained what a bad job the governor was doing the endless wars must end start thinking about getting bigger tractors  that is the real story  happy national farmers day  so now they are after the legendary crime buster and greatest mayor in the history of nyc rudy giuliani he may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer such a one sided witch hunt going on in usa deep state shameful louisiana get out and vote republican before going to the big game today a runoff will be a tremendous win for your great state lower taxes and car insurance and better protection of your 2nd amendment fantastic being with you last night other aspects of the deal are also great technology financial services 16-20 billion in boeing planes etc but wow the farmers really hit pay dirt      thank you to all republicans in congress for your invaluable help the deal i just made with china is by far the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our great patriot farmers in the history of our

suspect on your 2nd amendment good things are happening at china trade talk meeting warmer feelings than in recent past more like the old days i will be meeting with the vice premier today all would like to see something significant happen the joint statement released with president bolsonaro in march makes absolutely clear that i support brazil beginning the process for full oecd membership the united states stands by that statement and stands by   this article is fake news  over the next 13 months we are going to fight with all of our heart and soul  and we are going to win the great state of minnesota in 2020    a great evening in minneapolis minnesota with incredible american patriots thank you  the joint statement released with president bolsonaro in march makes absolutely clear that i support brazil beginning the process for full oecd membership the united states stands by that statement and stands by  this article is fake news  wow thank you minneapolis minnesota  on my way   we have one of three choices send in thousands of troops and win militarily hit turkey very hard financially and with sanctions or mediate a deal between turkey and the kurds we defeated 100percent of the isis caliphate and no longer have any troops in the area under attack by turkey in syria we did our job perfectly now turkey is attacking the kurds who have been fighting each other for 200 years big day of negotiations with china they want to make a deal but do i i meet with the vice premier tomorrow at the white house why isn't the ig investigating his so-called whistleblower all bad info the president of the ukraine just stated again in the strongest of language that president trump applied no pressure and did absolutely nothing wrong he used the strongest language possible that should end this democrat scam but it won't because the dems  media are fixed thank you to  one america news for your fair coverage and brilliant reporting it is appreciated by many people trying so hard to find a new consistent and powerful voice see you tonight at the big rally in minneapolis the area and start a new war all over again turkey is a member of nato others say stay out let the kurds fight their own battles even with our financial help i say hit turkey very hard financially  with sanctions if they don't play by the rules i am watching closely turkey has been planning to attack the kurds for a long time they have been fighting forever we have no soldiers or military anywhere near the attack area i am trying to end the endless wars talking to both sides some want us to send tens of thousands of soldiers to where is hunter biden he has disappeared while the fake news protects his crooked daddy  court justice  i turned him down he's been terrible ever since shep smith  who gave crooked hillary the debate questions  got fired from   others  doesn't deliver for us anymore it is so different than it used to be oh well i'm president from the day i announced i was running for president i have never had a good  poll whoever their pollster is they suck but  is also much different than it used to be in the good old days with people like andrew napolitano who wanted to be a supreme ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky told reporters thursday his controversial july call with president trump involved no bribe blackmail or quid pro quo as impeachment-minded democrats claim this should immediately end the talk of impeachment  in case the kurds or turkey lose control the united states has already taken the 2 isis militants tied to beheadings in syria known as the beetles out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the us they are the worst of the worst impeached for what having created the greatest economy in the history of our country building our strongest ever military cutting taxes too much  a different take  i don't think it's a whistleblower at all i think this is an anonymous source for the democratic staff in the house of representatives this is an insult to real whistleblowers actual whistleblowers go on to have their whole lives upended john kiriakou   the hardest thing i have to do as president  sleepy joe biden  so pathetic to see sleepy joe biden who with his son hunter and to the detriment of the american taxpayer has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars calling for my impeachment and i did nothing wrong joe's failing campaign gave him no other choice only 25 percent want the president impeached which is pretty low considering the volume of fake news coverage but pretty high considering the fact that i did nothing wrong it is all just a continuation of the greatest scam and witch hunt in the history of our country so why is someone a good or great president if they needed to spy on someone else's campaign in order to win that didn't work out so well and if they were unable to fill 142 important federal judgeships a record by far handing them all to me to choose will have 182 soon daca stand with all of its negative legal implications the republicans and democrats will have a deal to let them stay in our country in very short order it would actually benefit daca and be done the right way president obama said that he did not have the right to sign daca that it will never hold up in court he signed it anyway if the supreme court upholds daca it gives the president extraordinary powers far greater than ever thought if they do what is right and do not let crooked hillary should try it again  true should have never been there in the first place  why doesn't the icig do something about this scam he should have never let it start a dem hoax  adam schiff is a disgrace to our country  so true don and this was a big lie look what happened to friends of trump for less can't let this pass  but we are now for the first time giving companies a better alternative  great support from gop in fighting the radical left do nothing democrats  they don't have a clue but i do the usa is doing great despite the fed  no pressure at all said ukraine very congenial a perfect call the whistleblower and others spoke before seeing the transcript now they must apologize to me and stop this ridiculous impeachment the so-called whistleblower before knowing i was going to release the exact transcript stated that my call with the ukrainian president was crazy frightening and completely lacking in substance related to national security this is a very big lie read the transcript the do nothing democrats are con artists only looking to hurt the republican party and president their total focus is 2020 nothing more and nothing less the good news is that we will win in the history of our country we went to war under a false  now disproven premise weapons of mass destruction there were none now we are slowly  carefully bringing our great soldiers  military home our focus is on the big picture the usa is greater than ever before the united states has spent eight trillion dollars fighting and policing in the middle east thousands of our great soldiers have died or been badly wounded millions of people have died on the other side going into the middle east is the worst decision ever made fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years usa should never have been in middle east moved our 50 soldiers out turkey must take over captured isis fighters that europe refused to have returned the stupid endless wars for us are ending  so make all member countries pay not just the united states  he should be impeached for fraud  the whistleblower's lawyer is a big democrat the whistleblower has ties to one of my democrat opponents why does the icig allow this scam to continue the whistleblower's facts have been so incorrect about my no pressure conversation with the ukrainian president and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a democrat candidate that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly this is no whistleblower a total scam by the do nothing democrats for the good of the country this wirch hunt should end now  so amazing  wow just breaking the big deal whistleblower had a ‘professional tie' to 2020 democratic candidate washington examiner   in other words was working with someone who was potentially running against me why wasn't this reported by the icig a witch hunt scam so why is someone a good or great president if they needed to spy on someone else's campaign in order to win that didn't work out so well and if they were unable to fill 142 important federal judgeships a record by far handing them all to me to chose will have 182 soon bob mueller was pursuing the fbi director job when he met with president trump in 2017 administration officials say   bret baier and jake gibson  this is true even though mueller denied it the greatest witch hunt in the history of the usa  gasoline prices in the state of california are much higher than anywhere else in the nation $250 vs $450 i guess those very expensive and unsafe cars that they are mandating just aren't doing the trick don't worry california relief is on the way the state doesn't get it if there is a runoff in louisiana you will have a great new republican governor who will cut your taxes and car insurance and do a fabulous job for you and your family vote republican the party of honest abe lincoln big rally in louisiana on friday night must force a runoff with a liberal democrat governor john bel edwards who has let your taxes and car insurance get too high and will never protect your 2nd amendment vote for one of our two great republicans on saturday force a runoff this is just the beginning thank you to   the us border is secure  in fact the cops for trump t-shirt web site crashed because of incredible volume but is now back up and running proceeds go to the police union charities see you on thursday night in minneapolis radical left dem mayor of minneapolis jacob frey is doing everything possible to stifle free speech despite a record sell-out crowd at the target center presidents clinton and obama paid almost nothing the minneapolis police have been incredible friday night in louisiana will be great big crowd expected republicans must get out and vote for either of our two incredible candidates    so we can stop left leaning governor john bel edwards from getting over 50percent we will easily win the runoff  hasn't adam schiff been fully discredited by now do we have to continue listening to his lies get your great t-shirts cops for trump at   really nice thank you to minneapolis police officers  union  someone please tell the radical left mayor of minneapolis that he can't price out free speech probably illegal i stand strongly  proudly with the great police officers and law enforcement of minneapolis and the great state of minnesota see you thursday night thank you to lt bob kroll of the great minneapolis police department for your kind words on  the police are fighting the radical left mayor and his ridiculous uniform ban actually i love the cops for trump shirts want to bring some home i am with you 100percent i think that crooked hillary clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from uber left elizabeth warren only one condition the crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how  why she deleted 33000 emails after getting c subpoena to see importantly ambassador sondland's tweet which few report stated i believe you are incorrect about president trump's intentions the president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind that says it all i would love to send ambassador sondland a really good man and great american to testify but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court where republican's rights have been taken away and true facts are not allowed out for the public understands that while we only had 50 soldiers remaining in that section of syria and they have been removed any unforced or unnecessary fighting by turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency we are helping the kurds financially/weapons we may be in the process of leaving syria but in no way have we abandoned the kurds who are special people and wonderful fighters likewise our relationship with turkey a nato and trading partner has been very good turkey already has a large kurdish population and fully good health at my request pastor brunson who had many years of a long prison term remaining also remember and importantly that turkey is an important member in good standing of nato he is coming to the us as my guest on november 13th  so many people conveniently forget that turkey is a big trading partner of the united states in fact they make the structural steel frame for our f-35 fighter jet they have also been good to deal with helping me to save many lives at idlib province and returning in very the lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters 72000 ticket requests already dump frey and omar make america great again  thank you joni  adam should be impeached  great book  rt  lawmakers in both chambers have demanded that ic ig michael atkinson explain why he backdated to august secret changes he mad there are no felonies there are no impeachable offenses the constitution's very clear that you need bribery treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors you can't be impeached for the conduct that's been alleged in this case  dershowitz   a scam thank you   the captured isis fighters and families the us has done far more than anyone could have ever expected including the capture of 100percent of the isis caliphate it is time now for others in the region some of great wealth to protect their own territory the usa is great as i have stated strongly before and just to reiterate if turkey does anything that i in my great and unmatched wisdom consider to be off limits i will totally destroy and obliterate the economy of turkey i've done before they must with europe and others watch over down watching over a quagmire  spending big dollars to do so when i took over our military was totally depleted now it is stronger than ever before the endless and ridiculous wars are ending we will be focused on the big picture knowing we can always go back  blast i was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars where our great military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don't even like the usa the two most unhappy countries at this move are russia  china because they love seeing us bogged the radical left democrats have failed on all fronts so now they are pushing local new york city and state democrat prosecutors to go get president trump a thing like this has never happened to any president before not even close doesn't even include the almost $2000 that the families got from the trump tax cut stephen moore freedomworks  that means $5000 to $6000 more in disposable yearly income that americans have right now because of president trump heritage foundation these numbers are blockbusters just since donald trump took office median family incomrs are up over $4100 in 8 years under president obama they only went up $1000 in one third the time president trump has increased incomes 4 times as much and that incomes much higher under trump than bush obama  and almost everything else is better also except i am driving the deep state and the radical left do nothing democrats crazy ig declassified information contradicts the whistleblower   but why are people surprised the partisan whistleblower was very wrong on what was said on my perfect no pressure call with the ukrainian president bring in another whistleblower from the bench we just won the big court case on net neutrality rules a great win for the future and speed of the internet will lead to many big things including 5g congratulations to the fcc and its chairman ajit pai figure the situation out and what they want to do with the captured isis fighters in their neighborhood they all hate isis have been enemies for years we are 7000 miles away and will crush isis again if they come anywhere near us almost 3 years but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous endless wars many of them tribal and bring our soldiers home we will fight where it is to our benefit and only fight to win turkey europe syria iran iraq russia and the kurds will now have to again said no thinking as usual that the us is always the sucker on nato on trade on everything the kurds fought with us but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so they have been fighting turkey for decades i held off this fight for including capturing thousands of isis fighters mostly from europe but europe did not want them back they said you keep them usa i said no we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in us prisons at tremendous cost they are yours for trials they the united states was supposed to be in syria for 30 days that was many years ago we stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight when i arrived in washington isis was running rampant in the area we quickly defeated 100percent of the isis caliphate this makes nervous nancy every bit as guilty as liddle' adam schiff for high crimes and misdemeanors and even treason i guess that means that they along with all of those that evilly colluded with them must all be immediately impeached nancy pelosi knew of all of the many shifty adam schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon congress and the american people in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan whistleblower  lawyer  forgot to report that we are helping the great farmers of the usa to the tune of 28 billion dollars for the last two years paid for out of tariffs paid to the united states by china for targeting the farmer they devalued their currency therefore paying the cost unemployment rate just dropped to 35percent the lowest in more that 50 years is that an impeachable event for your president gerry baker of   do you think what you've seen rises to the level of impeachment ken starr clinton special prosecutor i don't sleepy eyes chuck todd of meet the press had a total meltdown in his interview with highly reaspected senator  seems that a not very bright chuck just wasn't getting the answers he was looking for in order to make me look as bad as possible i did nothing wrong join me at the target center in minneapolis minnesota this thursday october 10th at 7:00pm tickets   good job i must say by bob woodward on deface the nation the cbs no name hostess and other guest peter baker of the failing new york times were totally biased boring and wrong as usual but woodward was cool calm and interesting thank you bob democrat

a runoff and have a great new republican governor voting on saturday information for rally to follow  and by the way i would love running against 1percent joe biden i just don't think it's going to happen sleepy joe won't get to the starting gate  based on all of the money he  his family probably extorted joe should hang it up i wouldn't want him dealing with china  u the biden family was paid off pure and simple the fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable sleepy joe said he never spoke to the ukrainian company and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and hunter and separately got 15 billion dollars from china despite no experience and for no apparent reason there is no way these can be legitimate transactions as lawyers  others have stated as president i have an obligation to look into possible or probable corruption it is incredible to watch and read the fake news and how they pull out all stops to protect sleepy joe biden and his thrown out of the military son hunter who was handed $100000 a month plusplus from a ukrainian based company even though he had no experience in energy the democrats are lucky that they don't have any mitt romney types they may be lousy politicians with really bad policies open borders sanctuary cities etc but they stick together 95percent approval rating in republican party thank you the do nothing democrats are being exposed  the great scam is being revealed  the first so-called second hand information whistleblower got my phone conversation almost completely wrong so now word is they are going to the bench and another whistleblower is coming in from the deep state also with second hand info meet with shifty keep them coming president trump would be negligent if he did not bring this matter biden up if the vp of the us is self enriching  engaged in criminal behavior at a minimum corrupt behavior it ought to be looked at peter schweizer author secret empires  schiff and the do nothing dems have lost all credibilitybut the corrupt media is working hard to keep them in the game  mitt get off the stage you've had your turn twice  so crooked hillary clinton can delete and acid wash 33000 emails after getting a subpoena from the united states congress but i can't make one totally appropriate telephone call to the president of ukraine witch hunt no kevin jeff flake is better  i'm hearing that the great people of utah are considering their vote for their pompous senator mitt romney to be a big mistake i agree he is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the do nothing democrats  not only are the do nothing democrats interfering in the 2020 election but they are continuing to interfere in the 2016 election they must be stopped schiff is a fraud   this is the real story   mitt romney never knew how to win he is a pompous ass who has been fighting me from the beginning except when he begged me for my endorsement for his senate run i gave it to him and when he begged me to be secretary of state i didn't give it to him he is so bad for r's somebody please wake up mitt romney and tell him that my conversation with the ukrainian president was a congenial and very appropriate one and my statement on china pertained to corruption not politics if mitt worked this hard on obama he could have won sadly he choked the so-called whistleblower's account of my perfect phone call is way off not even close schiff and pelosi never thought i would release the transcript of the call got them by surprise they got caught this is a fraud against the american people the media is fixed and corrupt it bears no relationship to the truth the    are pure fiction totally dishonest reporting new extreme dems now running the party  thank you  and   shifty schiff duped by russian pranksters  too bad  thank you   report ‘whistleblower' never disclosed contact with house intel panel to inspector general great book  pelosi blatantly lies during  interview about schiff's reading of ukraine transcript where is the lamestream media on this  thanks jim would be great to just run our country  ex-envoy testified ukraine or the president of ukraine never raised quid pro quo concerns with him source    the president of ukraine also stated that he was not pressured by me in any way end of case of ukraine and cannot find any reason to charge the president with high crimes  misdemeanors this is just a phony witch hunt perpetuated by democrats to get rid of trump because they cannot beat him in a fair election  richard ketay it isn't often i get angry at the dirty politics of the democrats in congress but this time i am enraged and hope this impeachment charade will backfire on reps pelosi  schiff  the democrats i have read thoroughly the telephone conversation between trump  the president along with pelosi and her boss aoc the do nothing democrat leader  join me at the target center in minneapolis minnesota next thursday october 10th at 7:00pm tickets   my daughter ivanka will be on  tonight on  at 8:00 pm following the great  at 7:00 enjoy it to congress and the american people as though it was the statement of the president of the united states me he did it to fool congress and the public in order to make me look bad he is a sick puppy adam schiff's connection to the whistleblower is coming to light   these facts and others make it impossible for the ridiculous impeachment scam to go forward schiff has also committed a crime perhaps treason in making up a horrible statement and reading lyin' shifty schiff  when your making an unsubstantiated charge that the president of the united states is making a request having to do with quid pro quo this witness has blown a big hole into that statementthe ambassador put a dagger in the heart of schiffs fairytale  rep lee zeldin  i have just officially nominated poland for entry into the visa waiver program with this decades long-awaited announcement we are in the final steps of the process which when complete would grant polish nationals visa-free business and tourism travel to the us  vice versa at the request of  i have declared a major disaster for the great state of north carolina to help with damages from hurricane dorian assistance now unlocked to recover stronger than ever thom loves nc and so do i under my administration medicare advantage premiums next year will be their lowest in the last 13 years we are providing great healthcare to our seniors we cannot let the radical socialists take that away through medicare for all wow this is big stuff  i think it's outrages that a whistleblower is a cia agent  ed rollins  the witness was asked at least 20 times and there definitely was no quid pro quo     their whole case was built around this now they no longer mention when your making an unsubstantiated statement that the president is making a claim having to do with quid pro quo this witness has blown a big hole into that statement the ambassador put a dagger in the heart of schiffs fairytale  rep lee zeldin the whistleblower who had the facts wrong about the phone call reached out and more to the democrat controlled house intelligence committee schiff never told us about this breaking news unemployment rate at 35percent drops to a 50 year low wow america lets impeach your president even though he did nothing wrong as president i have an obligation to end corruption even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries it is done all the time this has nothing to do with politics or a political campaign against the bidens this does have to do with their corruption the washington times ukraine envoy blows ‘massive hole' into democrat accusations republicans at hearing find no trump pressure the ukrainian president also strongly stated that no pressure was put on him case closed nancy pelosi today on  actually said that adam schiffty schiff didn't fabricate my words in a major speech before congress she either had no idea what she was saying in other words lost it or she lied even clinton lover  strongly called her out sue her they do nothing dems are trying to nullify an election joe digenova  this isn't about a campaign this is about corruption on a massive scale  we are simultaneously fighting the fake news media and their partner the democrat party always tough to beat the press but people are beginning to see how totally corrupt they are and it makes our job a whole lot easier great job jim  aoc is a wack job  the do nothing democrats don't have time to get it done  rt  today at the villages in florida it was my great honor to sign an executive order on protecting and improving medicar another big loss for the do nothing dems  as the president of the united states i have an absolute right perhaps even a duty to investigate or have investigated corruption and that would include asking or suggesting other countries to help us out blowing massive holes inside of the theory the narrative that chairman schiff has been providing to the public   the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country  today at the villages in florida it was my great honor to sign an executive order on protecting and improving medicare for our nation's seniors today's action is only the latest of many important steps we are taking to dramatically improve healthcare for the american people  it was just a congenial phone call but its become so big i've never seen the media work so hard with so little    witch hunt thank you  really well done  drain the swamp  this is yet again an example of democrats projecting their criminal acts on president trump president trump is an innocent man it is a lawless coup attempt against a duly elected president   trump fundraising haul shows impeachment backfiring on dems  there wasn't anything said wrong in my conversation with the ukrainian president this is a democrat scam great time at the villages in florida today sorry we couldn't get everybody in i will be back soon  election interference 95percent approval rating in the republican party and record setting fundraising that has taken place over the past two weeks thank you leader mccarthy we look forward to you soon becoming speaker of the house the do nothing dems don't have a chance  fake news just like the snakes and gators in the moat the media is deranged they have lost their minds  schiff is a lowlife who should resign at least  schiff is a lying disaster for our country he should resign  the republican party has never had such support  book is doing really well a study in unfairness to a potentially great justice  thank you hugh  a great book by a brilliant author buy it now  great job richard  keep up the great work kellie  the ukraine controversy continues this morning as new documents obtained by  show that a former ukrainian prosecutor said that he was forced to back off looking into a firm tied to hunter biden   does anyone other than fake news protectors have a doubt the us won a $75 billion award from the world trade organization against the european union who has for many years treated the usa very badly on trade due to tariffs trade barriers and more this case going on for years a nice victory rt  look at this photograph  democrats want to steal the election   he loves our military and supports

second amendment look at this photograph  schiff house intel chairman got early account of whistle-blower's accusations schiff is a fraud   the do nothing democrats should be focused on building up our country not wasting everyone's time and energy on bullshit which is what they have been doing ever since i got overwhelmingly elected in 2016 223-306 get a better candidate this time you'll need it adam schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains honor and strength of secretary of state mike pompeo for a lowlife like schiff who completely fabricated my words and read them to congress as though they were said by me to demean a first in class at west point is sad democrats are trying to undo the election regardless of facts  nancy pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices  working on the desperately needed usmca she is incapable of working on either it is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment the do nothing democrats are stuck in mud all of this impeachment nonsense which is going nowhere is driving the stock market and your 401k's down but that is exactly what the democrats want to do they are willing to hurt the country with only the 2020 election in mind now the press is trying to sell the fact that i wanted a moat stuffed with alligators and snakes with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top at our southern border i may be tough on border security but not that tough the press has gone crazy fake news nancy pelosi and the democrats haven't met the standards of impeachment they have to be very careful here jeanne zaino   all the do nothing democrats are focused on is impeaching the president for having a very good conversation with the ukrainian president i knew that many people were listening even have a transcript they have been at this stuff from the day i got elected bad for country congressman adam schiff should resign for the crime of after reading a transcript of my conversation with the president of ukraine it was perfect fraudulently fabricating a statement of the president of the united states and reading it to congress as though mine he is sick massive sections of the wall are being built at our southern border it is going up rapidly and built to the highest standards and specifications of the border patrol experts it is actually an amazing structure our us military is doing a great job i won the right to be a presidential candidate in california in a major court decision handed down yesterday it was filed against me by the radical left governor of that state to tremendous media hoopla the victory however was barely covered by the fake news no surprise louisiana republicans must go out and vote republican in your governor's race a republican will win if you can force a runoff early voting has started your 2nd amendment and much else is at stake now the press is trying to sell the fact that i wanted a moot stuffed with alligators and snakes with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top at our southern border i may be tough on border security but not that tough the press has gone crazy fake news the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country  people their vote their freedoms their second amendment religion military border wall and their god-given rights as a citizen of the united states of america as i learn more and more each day i am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment it is a coup intended to take away the power of the a nancy pelosi/chuck schumer democrat john bel edwards who does nothing but stymie all of the things we are doing to make america great again don't be fooled john bel edwards will never be for us early voting has already started  republicans of louisiana it is really important for you to go out and vote on october 12th for either eddie rispone or ralph abraham both great which will lead to a runoff against why isn't congressman adam schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to congress as if this statement which was very dishonest and bad for me was directly made by the president of the united states this should never be allowed as i predicted jay powell and the federal reserve have allowed the dollar to get so strong especially relative to all other currencies that our manufacturers are being negatively affected fed rate too high they are their own worst enemies they don't have a clue pathetic the whistleblower and also the person who gave all of the false information to him this is simply about a phone conversation that could not have been nicer warmer or better no pressure at all as confirmed by  ukrainian pres it is just another democrat hoax so if the so-called whistleblower has all second hand information and almost everything he has said about my perfect call with the ukrainian president is wrong much to the embarrassment of pelosi  schiff why aren't we entitled to interview  learn everything about the congratulatory phone call with the ukrainian president was perfect unless you heard liddle' adam schiff's fraudulently made up version of the call this is just another fake news media together with their partner the democrat party hoax rt  our new data shows  approval rating has increased since this same time a week ago the american peop congratulations to president xi and the chinese people on the 70th anniversary of the people's republic of china great job just in time  you cannot judge my stock market performance since the

the 20th chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general mark milley  the fake news media wants to stay as far away as possible from the ukraine and china deals made by the bidens a corrupt media is so bad for our country in actuality the media may be even more corrupt than the bidens which is hard to do very simple i was looking for corruption and also why germany france and others in the european union don't do more for ukraine why is it always the usa that does so much and puts up so much money for ukraine and other countries by the way the bidens were corrupt they made this whole thing up impeachment is also a pre-emptive strike for what they think is coming on the obama administration's handling of the 2016 election jim mclaughlin highly respected pollster   president trump's job approval numbers have just reached the highest level since his inauguration around 50percent and you can add to that many votes from voters that don't talk about their vote once they saw the president's numbers going up they said ‘we gotta do something' so  who changed the long standing whistleblower rules just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report drain the swamp again the president of ukraine said there was no zero pressure put on him by me case closed again the president of the ukraine said there was no zero pressure put on him by me end of case place in trade it's

the united states is finally waking up to beijing's plans and ambitions to pass us as the dominant economic  military superpower in the 21st century what's happening now is that the us is finally responding thank you president trump this is taking rep adam schiff illegally made up a fake  terrible statement pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the ukrainian president and read it aloud to congress and the american people it bore no relationship to what i said on the call arrest for treason the fake whistleblower complaint is not holding up it is mostly about the call to the ukrainian president which in the name of transparency i immediately released to congress   the public the whistleblower knew almost nothing its 2nd hand description of the call is a fraud china trade turmoil china urging a calm and rational solution   china is doing very poorly while the usa under your favorite president's leadership continues to soar to new heights and despite the do nothing democrats we have just begun the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country this is about proving that donald trump was framed by the democrats   if the democrats are successful in removing the president from office which they will never be it will cause a civil war like fracture in this nation from which our country will never heal pastor robert jeffress  election and negate the votes of millions of evangelicals in the process they know the only impeachable offense that president trump has committed was beating hillary clinton in 2016 that's the unpardonable sin for which the democrats will never forgive him rid of donald j trump and the democrats don't care if they burn down and destroy this nation in the process i have never seen the evangelical christians more angry over any issue than this attempt to illegitimately remove this president from office overturn the 2016 nancy pelosi and the democrats can't put down the impeachment match they know they couldn't beat him in 2016 against hillary clinton and they're increasingly aware of the fact that they won't win against him in 2020 and impeachment is the only tool they have to get state department has stepped up hillary clinton email probe   you mean the 33000 emails that she has deleted and acid washed so they can never be found even though she said that all 33000 pertained only to her daughter's wedding and her yoga we are going to have an election very shortly rep jeff van drew democrat of new jersey   thank you just another witch hunt by nancy pelosi and the do nothing democrats all that's swirling around us now is impeachment we talk about it day and night it's what's on the news there is nothing that has turned up that is impeachable our founding fathers set impeachment to be extremely rare we need to get good stuff done let the people vote these radical left do nothing democrats are doing great harm to our country they are lying  cheating like never before in our country's history in order to destabilize the united states of america  it's upcoming 2020 election they  the fake news media are dangerous  bad in addition i want to meet not only my accuser who presented second  third hand information but also the person who illegally gave this information which was largely incorrect to the whistleblower was this person spying on the us president big consequences his lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great chamber he wrote down and read terrible things then said it was from the mouth of the president of the united states i want schiff questioned at the highest level for fraud  treason like every american i deserve to meet my accuser especially when this accuser the so-called whistleblower represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way then schiff made up what i actually said by lying to congress wishing a happy new year to all of those celebrating rosh hashanah in america israel and around the world  investigating corruption is correct  so great mark  will happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in 50

doing namely the usmca vote prescription drug price reduction gun safety infrastructure and much more wow they got caught end the witch hunt now  fraudulently and illegally inserted his made up  twisted words into my call with the ukrainian president to make it look like i did something very wrong he then boldly read those words to congress and millions of people defaming  libeling me he must resign from congress the whistleblower's complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new president of ukraine the so-called whistleblower knew practically nothing in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic  wrong just like liddle' adam schiff the conversation with the new and very good ukraine president who told the fake news at the united nations that he was not pressured by me in any way shape or form should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent witch hunt others ended in ashes how do you impeach a president who has

china additionally i demand transparency from democrats that went to ukraine and attempted to force the new president to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat i have informed  kevin mccarthy and all republicans in the house that i fully support transparency on so-called whistleblower information but also insist on transparency from joe biden and his son hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily wow ukraine whistleblower's lead attorney donated to biden  he president trump didn't specifically mention the explicit quid pro quo ofunless you investigate thiswe're going to withhold military aid to you pamela brown you don't see a direct quid pro quo in this  democrats wrote to the ukrainian government in may 2018 urging it to continue investigations into president donald trump's alleged collusion with russia in the 2016 presidential campaign  collusion later found not to exist  will the democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the ukrainian president they should a perfect call got them by surprise the democrats have been talking about impeaching donald trump since before he was inaugurated     and for no reason other than the great success we are having with the economy the military vets tax and regulation cuts healthcare and so much more there has been no president in the history of our country who has been treated so badly as i have the democrats are frozen with hatred and fear they get nothing done this should never be allowed to happen to another president witch hunt great new book by the brilliant andrew mccarthy ball of collusion the plot to rig an election and destroy a presidency get it and some other great new books which i will soon be recommending they tell you about the crooked pols and the witch hunt that has now been exposed thank you  and   thank you   he trump has already been suffering from this type of a witch hunt since before his inauguration if it's not one thing it's another it's a disgrace    sooooo true   thank you  -- totally agree  they dems are scrambling for a theme and narrative they've gone everywhere from russian hoax to russian collusionand now they've come to thisthey think they should have won the 2016 election they think in their bizarre brains that they did  mark levin media trying to protect biden ignoring massive democrat scandal  attorney for anti-trump ‘whistleblower' worked for hillary clinton chuck schumer  secretary of state pompeo recieved permission from ukraine government to release the transcript of the telephone call i had with their president they don't know either what the big deal is a total witch hunt scam by the democrats presidential harassment they never even saw the transcript of the call a total witch hunt pelosi nadler schiff and of course maxine waters can you believe this such an important day at the united nations so much work and so much success and the democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news witch hunt garbage so bad for our country the democrats are so focused on hurting the republican party and the president that they are unable to get anything done because of it including legislation on gun safety lowering of prescription drug prices infrastructure etc so bad for our country thank you  you will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call no pressure and unlike joe biden and his son no quid pro quo this is nothing more than a continuation of the greatest and most destructive witch hunt of all time i am currently at the united nations representing our country but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with president zelensky of ukraine hopefully they will work it out and quickly  true a wonderful meeting  she seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future so nice to see   bombshell information reports that the so-called whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge of that phone conversation with ukraine's president wow  it is all a democrat/adam schiff scam doing this for 3 years now and found nothing   94percent approval rating in the republican party thank you thank you working hard  this is the real corruption that the fake news media refuses to even acknowledge  know the correct facts is he on our country's side where does he come from is this all about schiff  the democrats again after years of being wrong the very thing that they are accusing president trump of doing which i didn't do was actually done by joe biden continues to be a double standard     these people are stone cold crooked also who is this so-called whistleblower who doesn't just leaving the great state of ohio for new york and a few big days at the united nations your country will be well represented breaking news the ukrainian government just said they weren't pressured at all during the nice call sleepy joe biden on the other hand forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by threat of not giving big dollars to ukraine that's the real story now the fake news media says i pressured the ukrainian president at least 8 times during my telephone call with him this supposedly comes from a so-called whistleblower who they say doesn't even have a first hand account of what was said more democrat/crooked media con incredible  the usa loves india  justice kavanaugh should sue the failing new york times for all they are worth look forward to being with our great india loving community  the  is trying to make someone justice kavanaugh into an evil person when they don't have the information to back it up it is a false hoax    zero people were fired at the times why will be in houston to be with my friend will be a great day in texas  they are trying to destroy and influence justice kavanaugh a very good man   100percent correct and they should be fully exposed for what they are i go along with joe  go across the world and you'll see either very low interest rates or negative rates the president wants to be competitive with these other countries on this but i don't think he'll fire jay powell even if i should we should always be paying less interest than others the real story involves hunter biden going around the world and collecting large payments from foreign governments and foreign oligarchs peter schweizer  laura ingraham hunter made a fortune in ukraine and in china he knew nothing about energy or anything else when someone gets nominated overwhelmingly and then wins the election as he did then he gets to set the national agenda the press is just outrages this  story is the most irresponsible thing i've ever seen    i agree they also lose too much the fake news media nowadays not only doesn't check for the accuracy of the facts they knowingly make up the facts they even make up sources in order to protect their partners the democrats it is so wrong but they don't even care anymore they have gone totally crazy the lamestream media had a very bad week they pushed numerous phony stories and got caught especially the failing new york times which has lost more money over the last 10 years than any paper in history and the amazon washington post they are the enemy of the people ukraine foreign minister disputes reports of any pressure from trump this conversation was long friendly and it touched on many questions   correct if your looking for something done wrong just look at the tape of sleepy joe he is being protected by the media they're trying to turn what was a biden scandal into a trump scandal  the problem is trump did nothing wrong with a foreign leader was this person officially asked to listen to the conversation or was he or she secretly listening in  it appears that an american spy in one of our intelligence agencies may have been spying on our own president the complaint suggests that this intel agent was listening in on trump's conversation the pretend ukraine scandal is an another malicious seditious effort to protect the obama/clinton gang criminal classified leaks and spying targeting trump  again  some of the best economic numbers our country has ever experienced are happening right now this is despite a crooked and demented deep state and a probably illegal democrat/fake news media partnership the likes of which the world has never seen make america great again now that the democrats and the fake news media have gone bust on every other of their witch hunt schemes they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others call it the ukraine witch hunt while at the same time trying to protect sleepy joe biden will fail again this is the real and only story  story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation i had with the new president of the ukraine nothing was said that was in any way wrong but biden's demand on the other hand was a complete and total disaster the fake news knows this but doesn't want to report the fake news media and their partner the democrat party want to stay as far away as possible from the joe biden demand that the ukrainian government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son or they won't get a very large amount of us money so they fabricate a they're trying to turn what was a biden scandal into a trump scandal  the problem is trump did nothing wrong i want to express my gratitude to america's magnificent  for tonight's exquisite evening where we celebrated more than a century of loyal and devoted friendship between🇺🇸🇦🇺both of our nations are blessed by uncommon courage unfailing commitment and unyielding character  rachel campos-duffy has written a wonderful book for children paloma wants to be lady freedom she and her husband sean duffy have done so much for our country buy this book great for the kids  thank you working hard  🇺🇸🇦🇺  statement strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation that they would not have also come forward do you know the reason why they did not because there was nothing said wrong it was pitch perfect the radical left democrats and their fake news media partners headed up again by little adam schiff and batting zero for 21 against me are at it again they think i may have had a dicey conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a highly partisan whistleblowers oh no really big political news perhaps the biggest story in years part time mayor of new york city   who was polling at a solid zero but had tremendous room for growth has shocking dropped out of the presidential race nyc is devastated he's coming home the us economy is the envy of the world as europe and asia slide ever toward recession but the left is trying to avoid talking about the trump economy   the best is yet to come great news  just renewed her deal with fox i don't care how much they paid her they got a beautiful bargain congratulations to both nice meeting with mark zuckerberg of  in the oval office today   because of my administration drug prices are down for the first time in almost 50 years  but the american people need congress to help i like sen grassley's drug pricing bill very much and it's great to see speaker pelosi's bill today let's get it done in a bipartisan way presidential harassment knowing all of this is anybody dumb enough to believe that i would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially heavily populated call i would only do what is right anyway and only do good for the usa another fake news story out there it never ends virtually anytime i speak on the phone to a foreign leader i understand that there may be many people listening from various us agencies not to mention those from the other country itself no problem great progress on the border wall  all polls and some brand new polls show very little support for impeachment such a waste of time especially with sooo much good that could be done including prescription drug price reduction healthcare infrastructure etc thank you  jay powell and the federal reserve fail again no guts no sense no vision  a terrible communicator happy 72nd birthday to our great     far safer and much less expensive many more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard meaning significantly more jobs jobs jobs automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to california you will be out of business  advantage and also due to the fact that older highly polluting cars will be replaced by new extremely environmentally friendly cars there will be very little difference in emissions between the california standard and the new us standard but the cars will be the trump administration is revoking california's federal waiver on emissions in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer while at the same time making the cars substantially safer this will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety i am pleased to announce that i will name robert c o'brien currently serving as the very successful special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the state department as our new national security advisor i have worked long  hard with robert he will do a great job i have just instructed the secretary of the treasury to substantially increase sanctions on the country of iran so nice that our country is now energy independent the usa is in better shape than ever before

outside at rio rancho to support t as corey lewandowski stated very clearly yesterday in front of the house judiciary committee president trump didn't do anything wrong or illegal but they all know that the democrats are hurting our country and getting nothing done shameful    no lindsey it was a sign of strength that some people just don't understand  the new york times is now blaming an editor for the horrible mistake they made in trying to destroy or influence justice brett kavanaugh it wasn't the editor the times knew everything they are sick and desperate losing in so many ways such a beautiful opening statement by corey lewandowski thank you corey  just departed new mexico for california where we are delivering results  that story kavanaugh is nowhere near the standard that should be met in publishing a story   the new york times is at its lowest point in its long and storied history not only is it losing a lot of money but it is a journalistic disaster being laughed at even in the most liberal of enclaves it has become a very sad joke all all over the world witch hunt hurt them if you want to stop the drug smugglers human traffickers and vicious ms-13 gang members from threatening our communities and poisoning our youth you have only one choice  you must elect more republicans   we are all united by the same love of country the same devotion to family and the same profound faith that america is blessed by the eternal grace of almighty god bound by these convictions we will campaign for every vote  we will win the great state of new mexico in 2020  beautiful

management the times is dead long live the new york times i call for the resignation of everybody at the new york times involved in the kavanaugh smear story and while you're at it the russian witch hunt hoax which is just as phony they've taken the old grey lady and broken her down destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation how many stories are wrong almost all of the stories the new york times has done are inaccurate and wrong   the new york times should close its doors and throw away the keys the women mentioned in the kavanaugh story said she didn't even remember the event congratulations   this afternoon at the  it was my great honor to present our nation's highest civilian honor the presidential medal of freedom to american baseball legend  congratulations on this extraordinary achievement mo  thank you working hard   big crowd expected in new mexico tonight where we will win your border wall is getting stronger each and every day  see you in a few hours  in a short while i will be presenting the new york   the greatest relief pitcher closer of all time with the presidential medal of freedom in the east room of the  for the privilege of being your president and doing the best job that has been done in many decades i am far beyond somebody paying for a hotel room for the evening or filling up a gas tank at an airport i do not own these radical left democrats are crazy obama netflix they failed on the mueller report they failed on robert mueller's testimony they failed on everything else so now the democrats are trying to build a case that i enrich myself by being president good idea except i will and have always expected to lose billions of dollars democrats would rather talk about gun control than get something done governor john sununu   the big questions are will they move the goalposts and is this just a ploy to take your guns away i hope not on both counts but i'll be able to figure it out remember when iran shot down a drone saying knowingly that it was in their airspace when in fact it was nowhere close they stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on saudi arabia we'll see just out kavanaugh accuser doesn't recall incident   do you believe what these horrible people will do or say they are looking to destroy and influence his opinions but played the game badly they should be sued what's happening to justice kavanaugh is a disgrace this guy is not a good man he is a great man he has to go to his church with his family while these terrible reports are being written about him a disgrace dan bongino  the new york times walks back report on kavanaugh assault claim   the one who is actually being assaulted is justice kavanaugh assaulted by lies and fake news this is all about the lamestream media working with their partner the dems the united states because of the federal reserve is paying a much higher interest rate than other competing countries they can't believe how lucky they are that jay powell  the fed don't have a clue and now on top of it all the oil hit big interest rate drop stimulus producer prices in china shrank most in 3 years due to china's big devaluation of their currency coupled with monetary stimulus federal reserve not watching will fed ever get into the game dollar strongest ever really bad for exports no inflationhighest interest rates because we have done so well with energy over the last few years thank you mr president we are a net energy exporter  now the number one energy producer in the world we don't need middle eastern oil  gas  in fact have very few tankers there but will help our allies 'these conservative judicial appointments will impact our nation for years to come' said lindsey graham republican of south carolina who leads the judiciary committee and who has been speeding through trump nominees the entire court system is changing at a record pace the  this week the senate passed a milestone in confirming the 150th federal judge of mr trump's administration to a lifetime appointment far outstripping barack obama's pace and fulfilling pledges by mr trump and mr o'connell to remake the federal judiciary work that way i have a better idea look at the obama book deal or the ridiculous netflix deal then look at all the deals made by the dems in congress the congressional slush fund and lastly the ig reports take a look at them those investigations would be over fast house judiciary has given up on the mueller report sadly for them after two years and $40000000 spent zero collusion zero obstruction so they say ok lets look at everything else and all of the deals that trump has done over his lifetime but it doesn't one my way to new mexico  see you all shortly at the    we cannot have what happened to this president happen again joe digenova  it is time for justice to come barreling in   can you imagine that with everything going on in this world the witch hunt though on a respirator is still whimpering along a disgrace the fake news is saying that i am willing to meet with iran no conditions that is an incorrect statement as usual here we go again with general motors and the united auto workers get together and make a deal plenty of oil saudi arabia oil supply was attacked there is reason to believe that we know the culprit are locked and loaded depending on verification but are waiting to hear from the kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed sufficient to keep the

probably don't want to  thank you billy  thank you  my great honor  that is true and the usa is winning again  amazing  the taliban has never been hit harder than it is being hit right now killing 12 people including one great american soldier was not a good idea there are much better ways to set up a negotiation the taliban knows they made a big mistake and they have no idea how to recover i'm ok with that  between our two countries i look forward to continuing those discussions after the israeli elections when we meet at the united nations later this month i had a call today with prime minister netanyahu to discuss the possibility of moving forward with a mutual defense treaty between the united states and israel that would further anchor the tremendous alliance keep america great make america great again 94percent approval rating in the republican party tuesday night in the great state of north carolina proved that high and very beautiful number correct who the hell is joy-ann reid never met her she knows zero about me has no talent and truly doesn't have the it factor needed for success in showbiz had a bad reputation and now works for the comcast/nbc losers making up phony stories about me low ratings fake news a very stable genius thank you while i like the vaping alternative to cigarettes we need to make sure this alternative is safe for all let's get counterfeits off the market and keep young children from vaping great news about the work we are doing on illegal immigration  historic milestone indeed  the two big congressional wins in north carolina on tuesday dan bishop and greg murphy have reverberated all over the world they showed a lot of people how strong the republican party is and how well it is doing 2020 is a big and very important election we will win very stupidly negotiated trade deals and illegal immigration are a tremendous cost and burden to our country they are both coming along very well and someday in the not too distant future america will see a very positive change remember america first illegal immigration costs the usa over 300 billion dollars a year there is no reason for this and things are being set in motion to have this number come way down democrats could end loopholes and it would be a whole lot easier and faster but it will all happen anyway ig report which showed him to be a disgraced  dirty cop republicans have unified like never before you don't impeach presidents for doing a good great job no obstruction no collusion only treasonous crimes committed by the other side and led by the democrats sad became number 1 in world  independent in energy will soon have record number of judges 2 sc justices done more than any president in first 2 1/2 years despite phony  fraudulent witch hunt illegally led against him win on mueller report mueller testimony  james comey how do you impeach a president who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our country all time best unemployment numbers especially for blacks hispanics asians  women more people working today than ever before rebuilt military  choice for vets rt  if reports are accurate that the doj is recommending charges against former fbi deputy director andy mccabe i'm not surp hello baltimore  in fact my views on venezuela and especially cuba were far stronger than those of john bolton he was holding me back  this should have been over with after the mueller report came out   we can't beat him so lets impeach him democrat rep al green dems have never gotten over the fact that president trump won the election  mccarthy some really big court wins on the border lately it is expected that china will be buying large amounts of our agricultural products european central bank acting quickly cuts rates 10 basis points they are trying and succeeding in depreciating the euro against the very strong dollar hurting us exports and the fed sits and sits and sits they get paid to borrow money while we are paying interest thank you brandon  thank you  the wall is going up very fast despite total obstruction by democrats in congress and elsewhere  the wall is being built after victories against the democrats in various courts  the southern border is becoming very strong despite the obstruction by democrats not agreeing to do anything on loopholes or asylum i had an excellent telephone conversation with andrés manuel lópez obrador president of mexico talking about southern border security and various other things of mutual interest for the people of our respective countries on october 1st we have agreed as a gesture of good will to move the increased tariffs on 250 billion dollars worth of goods 25percent to 30percent from october 1st to october 15th at the request of the vice premier of china liu he and due to the fact that the people's republic of china will be celebrating their 70th anniversary big united states supreme court win for the border on asylum  today and every day we pledge to honor our history to treasure our liberty to uplift our communities to live up to our values to prove worthy of our heroes and above all to never forget   leaving the white house soon to speak at the pentagon my great honor if it weren't for the never ending fake news about me and with all that i have done more than any other president in the first 2 1/2 years i would be leading the partners of the lamestream media by 20 points sorry but true this is a phony suppression poll meant to build up their democrat partners i haven't even started campaigning yet and am constantly fighting fake news like russia russia russia look at north carolina last night dan bishop down big in the polls wins easier than 2016 in a hypothetical poll done by one of the worst pollsters of them all the amazon washington post/abc which predicted i would lose to crooked hillary by 15 points how did that work out sleepy joe pocahontas and virtually all others would beat me in the general election the usa should always be paying the the lowest rate no inflation it is only the naïveté of jay powell and the federal reserve that doesn't allow us to do what other countries are already doing a once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of boneheads the federal reserve should get our interest rates down to zero or less and we should then start to refinance our debt interest cost could be brought way down while at the same time substantially lengthening the term we have the great currency power and balance sheet china suspends tariffs on some us products being hit very hard supply chains breaking up as many companies move or look to move to other countries much more expensive to china than originally thought    greg murphy won big 62percent to 37percent in north carolina 03  the fake news barely covered the race the win was far bigger than anticipated there was just nothing the fakers could say to diminish or demean the scope of this victory so we had two big victories tonight greg  dan alice  stewart thank you for the nice words while on  concerning the two big republican congressional victories you'd be great on a network with much higher ratings keep up the good work    were all set to have a big victory until dan bishop won north carolina 09 now you will hear them barely talk about or cover the race fake news never wins big night for the republican party congratulations to all greg murphy is a big winner in north carolina 03 much bigger margins than originally anticipated congratulations greg dan bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago he then asked me for help we changed his strategy together and he ran a great race big rally last night now it looks like he is going to win    are moving their big studio equipment and talent out stay tuned dan bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago he then asked me for help we changed his strategy together and he ran a great race big rally last night now it looks like he is going to win    are moving their big studio equipment and to talent out stay tuned senator ben sasse has done a wonderful job representing the people of nebraska he is great with our vets the military and your very important second amendment strong on crime and the border ben has my complete and total endorsement i am pleased to endorse governor mike parson of missouri he is very popular strong and knows what he is doing  he gets it based on the fact that mike has announced he will run again in 2020 for governor mike parson has my complete and total endorsement excellent interview by  on  on  very interesting and secure perspective on life one down one to go  greg murphy is projected to win in the great state of north carolina  incredible progress being made at the southern border  i asked john for his resignation which was given to me this morning i thank john very much for his service i will be naming a new national security advisor next week i informed john bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the white house i disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions as did others in the administration and therefore vote today for dan bishop will be great for north carolina and our country one of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the fake and corrupt news media is the phony polling information they put out many of these polls are fixed or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad internal polling looks great the best ever abc/washington post poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the 2016 election when my lawyers protested they took a 12 point down and brought it to almost even by election day it was a fake poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets sad north carolina vote for dan bishop today we need him badly in washington last night in north carolina was incredible  great job by the us coast guard  thank you  great job  beautiful evening in fayetteville tonight big day in north carolina tomorrow make sure you get out and vote for dan bishop in  and greg murphy in   thank you fayetteville north carolina make sure you get out and vote tomorrow for dan bishop in  and greg murphy in   north carolina  vote for dan bishop in  and greg murphy in  tomorrow make it a great day for republicans received an update on air force one at mcas cherry point in north carolina regarding damage caused by hurricane dorian  departing mcas cherry point in north carolina for fayetteville north carolina this is amazing  speaking to governor  of south carolina on my way to north carolina for a big rally for dan bishop  running for congress vote tomorrow   to every one of the heroes we recognized today  thank you and god bless you all  we have been serving as policemen in afghanistan and that was not meant to be the job of our great soldiers the finest on earth over the last four days we have been hitting our enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years the economy where there is no recession much to the regret of the lamestream media they are working overtime to help the democrats win in 2020 but that will never happen americans are too smart the look of turmoil in the white house of which there is none i view much of the media as simply an arm of the democrat party they are corrupt and they are extremely upset at how well our country is doing under my leadership including a lot of fake news is being reported that i overruled the vp and various advisers on a potential camp david meeting with the taliban this story is false i always think it is good to meet and talk but in this case i decided not to the dishonest media likes to create the trump administration has achieved more in the first 2 1/2 years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our country we get zero media credit for what we have done and are doing but the people know and that's all that is important i had nothing to do with the decision of our great  mike pence to stay overnight at one of the trump owned resorts in doonbeg ireland mike's family has lived in doonbeg for many years and he thought that during his very busy european visit he would stop and see his family i know nothing about an air force plane landing at an airport which i do not own and have nothing to do with near turnberry resort which i do own in scotland and filling up with fuel with the crew staying overnight at turnberry they have good taste nothing to do with me that this administration has done they don't talk about the great economy the big tax and regulation cuts the rebuilding of the military choice at our va our vets judges and supreme court justices the border wall going up lowest crime numbers 2nd a and so much more as bad as  is comcast msnbc is worse their ratings are also way down because they have lost all credibility i believe their stories about me are not 93percent negative but actually 100percent negative they are incapable of saying anything positive despite all of the great things but most importantly  is bad for the usa their international division spews bad information  fake news all over the globe this is why foreign leaders are always asking me why does the media hate the us sooo much it is a fraudulent shame  all comes from the top great news that an activist investor is now involved with att as the owner of very low ratings  perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the fake news emanating from its non-credible anchors also i hear that because of its bad ratings it is losing a fortune 94percent approval rating in the republican party a record thank you house republicans should allow chairs of committees to remain for longer than 6 years it forces great people and real leaders to leave after serving the dems have unlimited terms while that has its own problems it is a better way to go fewer people in the end will leave but then he ran for congress and won only to lose his re-elect after i tweeted my endorsement on election day for his opponent but now take heart he is back and running for president of the united states the three stooges all badly failed candidates will give it a go when the former governor of the great state of south carolina  was reported missing only to then say he was away hiking on the appalachian trail then was found in argentina with his flaming dancer friend it sounded like his political career was over it was north carolina vote for dan bishop tomorrow we need him badly in washington his opponent is a far left sanctuary cities supporter maria  john understood the dishonesty  deception from the very beginning  the importance or passage of criminal justice reform they only talk about the minor players or people that had nothing to do with itand the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed all they talk about now is impeaching president trump musician  and his filthy mouthed wife are talking now about how great it is but i didn't see them around when we needed help getting it passed anchor doesn't even bring up the subject of president trump or the republicans when talking about a man named  and many others were profusely grateful at that time i signed it into law no one else did  republicans deserve much credit but now that it is passed people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise guys like boring when all of the people pushing so hard for criminal justice reform were  unable to come even close to getting it done they came to me as a group and asked for my help i got it done with a group of senators  others who would never have gone for it obama couldn't come close the trump administrations has achieved more in the first 2 1/2 years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our country we get zero media credit for what we have done and are doing but the people know and that's all that is important congratulations to  pirro on having again the number one best selling book looking forward to being in the north carolina tomorrow night we're having a big rally for a great guy dan bishop strong on crime borders your military and our vets we need dan bishop in washington badly his opponent is weak on crime borders and against your 2nd a we are building the wall  leakin' lyin' james comey  only made it worse if they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks and would even kill 12 innocent people then they probably don't have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway how many more decades are they willing to fight an attack in kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers and 11 other people i immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations what kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position they didn't they unbeknownst to almost everyone the major taliban leaders and separately the president of afghanistan were going to secretly meet with me at camp david on sunday they were coming to the united states tonight unfortunately in order to build false leverage they admitted to fake news i would like very much to stop referring to this ridiculous story but the lamestream media just won't let it alone they always have to have the last word even though they know they are defrauding  deceiving the public the public knows that the media is corrupt the failing new york times stated in an article written by obama flunky peter baker who lovingly wrote obama bookeven after the president forecast the storm to include alabama this is not true i said very early on that it may even hit alabama a big difference our economy is doing great  jobs jobs jobs  congratulations to the great jerry west   thank you katie the us is doing great  russia and ukraine just swapped large numbers of prisoners very good news perhaps a first giant step to peace congratulations to both countries in 22 years of patrolling our southern border i have never seen mexico act like a true border security partner until president trump got involved and now they are stepping up to the plate and doing what they need to do brandon judd national border patrol the washington post's  mr off the record   two nasty lightweight reporters shouldn't even be allowed on the grounds of the white house because their reporting is so disgusting  fake also add the appointment of many federal judges this summer  i want to congratulate  mitch mcconnell and all republicans today i signed the 160th federal judge to the bench within a short period of time we will be at over 200 federal judges including many in the appellate courts  two great new us supreme court justices i would also like to thank papa doug manchester hopefully the next ambassador to the bahamas for the incredible amount of time money and passion he has spent on helping to bring safety to the bahamas much work to be done by the bahamian government we will help  thank you to bahamian prime minister hubert minnis for your very gracious and kind words in saying that without the help of the united states and me their would have been many more casualties i give all credit to fema the us coast guard  the brave people of the bahamas china just enacted a major stimulus plan with all the tariffs they are paying to the usa billions and billions of dollars they need it in the meantime our federal reserve sits back and does nothing promises made promises kept  that were not hit  and that are in good condition any cruise ship companies willing to act as stationary housing etc i am sure would be appreciated the   and all others along with other countries that have been helping have been asked to move people in the badly hit sections of the bahamas to other sections of the bahamas the washington post's lost summer  china is eating the tariffs billions pouring into usa targeted patriot farmers getting massive dollars from the incoming tariffs good jobs numbers no inflationfed china having worst year in decades talks happening good for all the economy is great the only thing adding to uncertainty is the fake news great job by fema law enforcement first responders us coast guard and all keep going we all appreciate what you are doing partner should start playing it straight it would be so much better for our country this nonsense has never happened to another president four days of corrupt reporting still without an apology but there are many things that the fake news media has not apologized to me for like the witch hunt or spygate the lamestream media and their democrat the fake news media was fixated on the fact that i properly said at the beginnings of hurricane dorian that in addition to florida  other states alabama may also be grazed or hit they went crazy hoping against hope that i made a mistake which i didn't check out maps larry kudlow on  now our great  has just written a book that will add to the tremendous success of her last number one best seller it's called radicals resistance and revenge the left's plot to remake america it is a fantastic book go get it  great interview of sarah sanders by  she is a terrific person with a great future congratulations to  and his sister on a great success what a wonderful thing to do i agree with  the fed should lower rates they were way too early to raise and way too late to cut and big dose quantitative tightening didn't exactly help either where did i find this guy jerome oh well you can't win them all daca will be going before the supreme court it is a document that even president obama didn't feel he had the legal right to sign he signed it anyway rest assured that if the sc does what all say it must based on the law a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all president obama never had the legal right to sign daca and he indicated so at the time of signing but in any event how can he have the right to sign and i don't have the right to unsigned totally illegal document which would actually give the president new powers have the discretion to end the program that president obama began in his discretion that program was unlawful to begin with i think it's very unlikely that the scotus is going to issue an order reinstating what it believes is an unlawful program daca is unlawful  the immigration law institute's christopher hajec says the supreme court has to look st whether daca is lawful what they are looking at now is whether trump's recision of daca is lawful must consider lawfulness of daca itself looks very odd that president trump doesn't that our economy is very strong if the fed would lower rates to where the bond market says they should be then i really wouldn't worry about a recession   i think president trump is set in his ways because he doesn't see any weakening i mean look at the joblessness report today what i'm surprised at is how strong the consumer is i think the chinese need it a deal more than we do it's statistical i just think looking forward to watching  sanders tomorrow morning on  by far the  rated show on morning cable at 8:30am sarah will be an incredible addition to  great job done by   senator  and all of the those from florida that were so brilliantly involved including   law enforcement and first responders thank you all just got off the phone with governor brian kemp  of georgia happy to hear that things are looking good for everyone i stand by ready to assist along with our great team at   we're with you all the way just spoke to governor  of south carolina regarding hurricane dorian i informed henry that we are monitoring south carolina and stand by ready to assist be safe everyone we are totally with you just talked to governor roy cooper of north carolina as hurricane dorian ominously comes up the east coast we are monitoring it at the  ready to assist via our great team over at  who are already on site we are with you all the way north carolina be safe i was with you all the way alabama the fake news media was not  just as i said alabama was originally projected to be hit the fake news denies it  his dedication to israel and to seeking peace between israel and the palestinians won't be forgotten he will be missed thank you jason after almost 3 years in my administration jason greenblatt will be leaving to pursue work in the private sector jason has been a loyal and great friend and fantastic lawyer really good jobs numbers alabama was going to be hit or grazed and then hurricane dorian took a different path up along the east coast the fake news knows this very well that's why they're the fake news said what she did even being on a much higher rated show she would have been thrown off television will fake news nbc allow a mccarthy style racist to continue abc fired roseanne watch the double standard bad actress debra the mess messing is in hot water she wants to create a blacklist of trump supporters  is being accused of mccarthyism is also being accused of being a racist because of the terrible things she said about blacks and mental illness if roseanne barr instead it turned north and went up the coast where it continues now in the one model through florida the great state of alabama would have been hit or grazed in the path it took no read my full fema statement what i said was accurate all fake news in order to demean in the early days of the hurricane when it was predicted that dorian would go through miami or west palm beach even before it reached the bahamas certain models strongly suggested that alabama  georgia would be hit as it made its way through florida  to the gulf thank you rad looking great  thank you terrence best employment numbers in history for african americans  information does come out charlie hurt washington times   facts and that should terrify every american regardless of their political stripe the idea that all of that information hasn't already been revealed shows how dastardly these people are and how terrified they are about what's going to happen when that absolutely nothing is more important than going back  getting to the bottom of the origins of the investigation we had an administration using america's spying apparatus to spy on a political opponent at the height of a presidential election those are all known undisputed this was the originally projected path of the hurricane in its early stages as you can see almost all models predicted it to go through florida also hitting georgia and alabama i accept the fake news apologies  state rep greg murphy is running for congress in north carolina district 3 we really need greg in washington he is great w/ the military our vets  your 2a strong on crime and the border has had my total endorsement for a long time please vote for greg on september 10th 7 the badly flawed paris climate agreement protects the polluters hurts americans and cost a fortune not on my watch8 i want crystal clean water and the cleanest and the purest air on the planet  we've now got that 6 the democrats' destructive environmental proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump don't the democrats care about fighting american poverty 4 the us now leads the world in energy productionbut 5 who's got the world's cleanest and safest air and water america 1 which country has the largest carbon emission reductionamerica2 who has dumped the most carbon into the air   china3 91percent of the world's population are exposed to air pollution above the world health organization's suggested level   none are in the usa 8 facts that  will ignore in tonight's climate forum we can't have a system where we run our entire economy for the benefit of other countries which have long charged us big tariffs don't keep ducking the reality the us has been subject to tariff terrorism for 50 years but a real deal can be done sam zell  trump is doing to china is not lost on the rest of the world europe has had among the most protectionist policies forever they're sitting there and saying gee are we next maybe you are we've got to change the rules the us can't defend the world and pay for it the chinese are very adept at not accepting anything you've got to be very tough and that's what trump is doing it's in china's interest to correct and i think we'll end up with a solution that's dramatically better than we have today frankly i think the impact of what us winning trade war with china in dollars cnbc we can't have a system where we run our entire economy for the benefit of other countries which have long charged us big tariffs don't keep ducking the reality the us has been subject to tariff terrorism for 50 years but a real deal can be done sam zell  trump is doing to china is not lost on the rest of the world europe has had among the most protectionist policies forever they're sitting there and saying gee are we next maybe you are we've got to change the rules the us can't defend the world and pay for it the chinese are very adept at not accepting anything you've got to be very tough and that's what trump is doing it's in china's interest to correct and i think we'll end up with a solution that's dramatically better than we have today frankly i think the impact of what on the president of the united states   to declassify is so important because if this were a democrat president or a democrat candidate that was spied on the way president trump was spied on this would be a scandal that would make watergate look like nothing illegal spying i am so tired of hearing the rationalization of the left in the country because they hate donald trump inexplicably and without foundation they choose to hate america the democrats have truly become the party of hate  the truth is that we have a nation that is disgusted with the fbi we have a crisis of confidence in the number one law enforcement agency in this country thanks comey  it's a scandal  at the request of senator thom tillis i am getting the north carolina emergency declaration completed and signed tonight hope you won't need it the us may be getting a little bit lucky with respect to hurricane dorian but please don't let down your guard as it heads up the coast lots of very bad and unpredictable things can happen on the other hand the bahamas have been devastated we are sending crews to help  knife crime which is totally out of control in london people are afraid to even walk the streets he is a terrible mayor who should stay out of our business the incompetent mayor of london sadiq khan was bothered that i played a very fast round of golf yesterday many pols exercise for hours or travel for weeks me i run through one of my courses very inexpensive president obama would fly to hawaii kahn should focus on based on the ig report the whole witch hunt against me and my administration was a giant and illegal scam the house of representatives should now get back to work on drug prices healthcare infrastructure and all else the mueller report showed no collusion no obstruction germany and so many other countries have negative interest rates they get paid for loaning money and our federal reserve fails to act remember these are also our weak currency competitors for all of the geniuses out there many who have been in other administrations and taken to the cleaners by china that want me to get together with the eu and others to go after china trade practices remember the eu  all treat us very unfairly on trade also will change and then think what happens to china when i win deal would get much tougher in the meantime china's supply chain will crumble and businesses jobs and money will be gone we are doing very well in our negotiations with china while i am sure they would love to be dealing with a new administration so they could continue their practice of ripoff usa$600 b/year16 months plus is a long time to be hemorrhaging jobs and companies on a long-shot trade agreement      making great progress for our farmers approved e-15 year round big additional list to be submitted  approved within two weeks will be even better for ethanol and we save our small refineries brazil will allow more american ethanol to enter the country without tariffs a decision that brazilian mills are celebrating the seemingly counter-intuitive reaction stems from the tone of ongoing negotiations between the south american nation and the us for a knife crime which is totally out of control in london people are afraid to even walk the streets he is a terrible mayor who should stay out of our business the incompetent mayor of london sadique kahn was bothered that i played a very fast round of golf yesterday many pols exercise for hours or travel for weeks me i run through one of my courses very inexpensive president obama would fly to hawaii kahn should focus on when in fact under certain original scenarios it was in fact correct that alabama could have received some hurt always good to be prepared but the fake news is only interested in demeaning and belittling didn't play my whole sentence or statement bad people such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter  of  i suggested yesterday at fema that along with florida georgia south carolina and north carolina even alabama could possibly come into play which was true they made a big deal about this the good news is that we are winning our real opponent is not the democrats or the dwindling number of republicans that lost their way and got left behind our primary opponent is the fake news media in the history of our country they have never been so bad the lamestream media has gone totally crazy they write whatever they want seldom have sources even though they say they do never do fact checking anymore and are only looking for the kill they take good news and make it bad they are now beyond fake they are corrupt the amazon washington post did a story that i brought racist attacks against the squad no they brought racist attacks against our nation all i do is call them out for the horrible things they have said the democrats have become the party of the squad trump economics with president trump tariffs are bringing companies back to the usa like he said they would  swing states that went to trump in 2016 because he promised not to forget about them like the establishment had done for decades and their trust in president trump paid off as they saw their incomes riseand it's the lowest paid workers who have gained the most with average hourly wages growth has far outpaced what we saw with president obama across all industries from mining and construction to leisure  hospitality with president trump we see income growth in states like iowa ohio pennsylvania wisconsin nevada florida the last three years of trump policy have finally brought real hope and real change unemployment this year hit a 50 year low with president trump we've seen the lowest ever african american and hispanic unemployment the booming trump economy has pushed up workers wages they are liars and in my opinion traitors  talking about comey and his dwindling group of friends and watched nafta is the worst trade deal ever made terrible for labor and richard let it stand no wonder unions are losing so much the workers will vote for me in 2020 lowest unemployment most jobs ever and should stop paying exorbitant $dues not worth it just watched afl-cio president richard trumka on  and thought to myself how different he is on tv than he is when he is with me at the white house likes what we are doing until the cameras go on we got robbed on trade and everything else while his dems just sat back since my election many trillions of dollars of worth has been created for our country and the stock market is up over 50percent if you followed the advice of the failing new york times columnist paul krugman you'd be doing very poorly you'd be angry and hurt he never got it adds up to the most ambitious pro-worker policy agenda this country has ever seen the president promised jobs jobs jobs and that is exactly what he is delivering    when you put everything together the pro growth tax  regulation cuts help to retrain workers the tariffs which encourage manufacturers to come back to america along with president trumps tough approach on immigration strong stance on illegals promoting merit based it when in fact under certain original scenarios it was in fact correct that alabama could have received some hurt always good to be prepared but the fake news is only interested in demeaning and belittling didn't play my whole sentence or statement bad people such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter  of  i suggested yesterday at fema that along with florida georgia south carolina and north carolina even alabama could possibly come into play which was true they made a big deal about this trade agreement       making great progress for our farmers approved e-15 year round big additional list to be submitted and approved within two weeks will be even better for ethanol and we save our small refineries brazil will allow more american ethanol to enter the country without tariffs a decision that brazilian mills are celebrating the seemingly counter-intuitive reaction stems from the tone of ongoing negotiations between the south american nation and the us for a this judge thomas ambro majotity opinion and thank god for a president like donald j trump who will appoint judges like this he will soon have appointed 180 new federal judges not even including two great new supreme court justices   we hold that legislative prayer is government speech not open to attack via those channels third circuit court of appeals lou that's why this next election is so important the soul of america they want to take religion out of american lives thank god for judges like pray for the people in the bahamas being hit like never before category 5  almost 200 mph winds great job by texas law enforcement and first responders in handling the terrible shooting tragedy yesterday thank you also to the fbi  and all others a very tough and sad situation in addition to florida south carolina north carolina georgia and alabama will most likely be hit much harder than anticipated looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever already category 5 be careful god bless everyone this is only the beginning  i have not forgotten that when it was announced that i was going to do the apprentice and when it then became a big hit helping nbc's failed lineup greatly  came up to me at an upfront  profusely thanked me even calling me sir how times have changed comey and mccabe and more are dirty cops joe digenova reports are coming comey very vulnerable but where is the supreme court where is justice roberts if you lie to a court you should be held in contempt so if you abused the fisa you must be held accountable i hope justice roberts will take action jason chaffetz fox james comey has been rebuked at the highest level with much more to come an ig report doesn't get any stronger calling him dangerous insubordinate thank goodness that donald trump was elected because if he wasn't elected these people would still be in power two more is about american freedom redirect the supply chain there is no reason to buy everything from china peter morici economist tariffs will not impact american consumers that much because the chinese currency has gone down which gives our importers a discount importers can find suppliers outside of china absolutely worth it we don't want to be servants to the chinese this just briefed by attorney general barr about the shootings in texas fbi and law enforcement is fully engaged more to follow the vindication belongs to the president for firing james comey it was clearly the right thing to do you don't want an fbi director with jim comey's ethics jason riley wall street journal enjoy the low gas prices over the labor day weekend my energy policies have made america energy independent while keeping prices low just like a tax cut the democrats green policies will raise your price of gas  but now we are moving forward like never before we are winning again and we are respected again being scolded by failed former intelligence officials like james clapper on my condolences to iran on their failed rocket launch sadly for the united states guys like him comey and the even dumber john brennan don't have a clue they really set our country back just watched congresswoman debbie dingell and many other democrats wanting to give up on our very successful trade battle with china which has had its worst economic year in memory and getting worse we are taking in $billions will be big for farmers and all has anyone noticed that the top shows on  and cable ratings are those that are fair or great to your favorite president me congratulations to  for being the number one show on cable television dan will be great  looking like our great south carolina could get hit much harder than first thought georgia and north carolina also it's moving around and very hard to predict except that it is one of the biggest and strongest and really wide that we have seen in decades be safe make america great again which is happening and then keep america great i was right about comey crooked cop a great team working hard  rt  the great state of north carolina has early voting for a very important congressional ninth race please vote early yes i am currently suing various people for violating their confidentiality agreements disgusting and foul mouthed omarosa is one i gave her every break despite the fact that she was despised by everyone and she went for some cheap money from a book numerous others also while madeleine westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement she is a very good person and i don't think there would ever be reason to use it she called me yesterday to apologize had a bad night i fully understood and forgave her i love tiffany doing great has anyone noticed that the top shows on  and cable ratings are those that are fair or great to your favorite president me congratulations to  for being the number one shoe on cable television the ig found that james comey leaked classified documents to his attorneys which can be is a violation of the espionage act this is consistent with all the lies that comey has been spreading     cory is doing a great job for colorado  nobody knows more about healthcare than john great guy  an amazing guy respected by all  nobody works harder or smarter than joni  one of the greats  great job thom  thank you kevin great things are happening at the border  i am monitoring hurricane dorian and receiving frequent briefings and updates it is important to heed the directions of your state and local officials this is an extremely dangerous storm please prepare and be safe       pass the laugh test and the inspector general just knocked that down    they could have charged comey with theft of government documents 641 of the criminal code because the ig found these were not his personal documents these were government documents   comey's claim that these were just his own personal recollections would not just arrived at camp david the great state of north carolina has early voting for a very important congressional ninth race please vote early now or on election day september 10th for dan bishop a great guy his opponent wants open borders sanctuary cities  is weak on crime military  vets this should never happen to another president again  fallout from ig's scathing comey report  one of the most disgraceful examples of an abuse of power by a government officialwhen you read this reportthis is a systematic effort to go after candidate trump president elect-trump and president trumpyou could virtually call this an attempted coup   thanks  true  the united states of america was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the safir slv launch at semnan launch site one in iran i wish iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at site one  if the fed would cut we would have one of the biggest stock market increases in a long time badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small tariffs instead of themselves for bad managementand who can really blame them for doing that excuses we don't have a tariff problem we are reigning in bad and/or unfair players we have a fed problem they don't have a clue the euro is dropping against the dollar like crazy giving them a big export and manufacturing advantageand the fed does nothing our dollar is now the strongest in history sounds good doesn't it except to those manufacturers that make product for sale outside the us bryan dean wright former cia officerdem in 2016 we had a coup we have to take comey and others to task makes no sense not to prosecute him comey got a book deal i fear for my country he tried to kneecap our duly elected president and there are no consequences  the fact that james comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable attorney general bill barr is so many people and experts that i have watched and read would have taken an entirely different course comey got lucky the disastrous ig report on james comey shows in the strongest of terms how unfairly i and tens of millions of great people who support me were treated our rights and liberties were illegally stripped away by this dishonest fool we should be given our stolen time back an idea liked by many  general motors which was once the giant of detroit is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there they moved major plants to china before i came into office this was done despite the saving help given them by the usa now they should start moving back to america again establishment of the us space command  perhaps never in the history of our country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than james comey in the just released inspector general's report he should be ashamed of himself the farmers are going to be so happy when they see what we are doing for ethanol not even including the e-15 year around which is already done it will be a giant package get ready at the same time i was able to save the small refineries from certain closing great for all the economy is doing great with tremendous upside potential if the fed would do what they should we are a rocket upward the totally inaccurate reporting by lawrence o'donnell for which he has been forced by nbc to apologize is no different than the horrible corrupt and fraudulent fake news that i and many millions of great supporters have had to put up with for years so bad for the usa for the most ridiculous claim of all that russia russia russia or russian oligarchs co-signed loan documents for me a guarantee totally false as is virtually everything else he and much of the rest of the lamestream media has said about me for years all apologize crazy lawrence o'donnell who has been calling me wrong from even before i announced my run for the presidency even being previously forced by nbc to apologize which he did while crying for things he said about me  the apprentice was again forced to apologize this time hurricane dorian looks like it will be hitting florida late sunday night be prepared and please follow state and federal instructions it will be a very big hurricane perhaps one of the biggest puerto rico is in great shape with hurricane dorian taking a largely different route than anticipated thank you to fema first responders and all for working so hard  being so well prepared a great result the bad news florida get ready storm is building and will be big there has never been a time in the history of our country that the media was so fraudulent fake or corrupt when the age of trump is looked back on many years from now i only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the fake news the  amazon washington post and  just did a fake interview on pardons for aids on the wall and that i didn't think the wall on the southern border was that important to stop illegals wanting to come into our country wrong vitally important will make a big impact so bad a sad day for the democrats kirsten gillibrand has dropped out of the presidential primary i'm glad they never found out that she was the one i was really afraid of thank you for the support as we make america great again  another totally fake story in the amazon washington post lobbyist which states that if my aides broke the law to build the wall which is going up rapidly i would give them a pardon this was made up by the washington post only in order to demean and disparage fake news the wall is going up very fast despite total obstruction by democrats in congress and elsewhere   and by the way i'm the best thing that's ever happened to puerto rico puerto rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth their political system is broken and their politicians are either incompetent or corrupt congress approved billions of dollars last time more than anyplace else has ever gotten and it is sent to crooked pols no good our federal reserve cannot mentally keep up with the competition other countries at the g-7 in france all of the other leaders were giddy about how low their interest costs have gone germany is actually getting paid to borrow money zero interest plus no clue fed i don't want to win for myself i only want to win for the people the new  is letting millions of great people down we have to start looking for a new news outlet fox isn't working for us anymore are all in for the open border socialists or beyond fox hires give hillary the questions  juan williams and low ratings shep smith hopeless  clueless they should go all the way left and i will still find a way to win that's what i do win too bad just watched  heavily promoting the democrats through their dnc communications director spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback by anchor  terrible considering that fox couldn't even land a debate the dems give them nothing    would be very hard for jeremy corbyn the leader of britain's labour party to seek a no-confidence vote against new prime minister boris johnson especially in light of the fact that boris is exactly what the uk has been looking for  will prove to be a great one love uk we are tracking closely tropical storm dorian as it heads as usual to puerto rico fema and all others are ready  and will do a great job when they do let them know it and give them a big thank you not like last time that includes from the incompetent mayor of san juan so interesting to read and see all of the free and interesting advice i am getting on china from people who have tried to handle it before and failed miserably in fact they got taken to the cleaners we are doing very well with china this has never happened to them before the infestation of bedbugs at the new york times office   was perhaps brought in by lightweight journalist bret stephens a conservative who does anything that his bosses at the paper tell him to do he is now quitting twitter after being called a bedbug tough guy a made up radical left story about doral bedbugs but bret stephens is loaded up with them been calling me wrong for years along with the few remaining never trumpers all losers  another is a one-time bad congressman from illinois who lost in his second term by a landslide then failed in radio the third is a man who couldn't stand up straight while receiving an award i should be able to take them can you believe it i'm at 94percent approval in the republican party and have three stooges running against me one is mr appalachian trail who was actually in argentina for bad reasons axios whatever that is sat back and said geeeee let's see what can we make up today to embarrass the president then they said why don't we say he wants to bomb a hurricane that should do it the media in our country is totally out of control they do stories so big on elizabeth pocahontas warren's crowd sizes adding many more people than are actually there and yet my crowds which are far bigger get no coverage at all fake news it is amazing that i can be at 51percent with zogby when the fake  corrupt news is almost 100percent against me great job mr president the g7 in france was so successful and yet when i came back and read the corrupt and fake news and watched numerous networks it was not even recognizable from what actually took place at the great g7 event looking forward to being with dan bishop in two weeks in north carolina his opponent believes in open borders and sanctuary cities and won't protect your second amendment   pirro is following up her  best seller with another book that is destined to also be   radicals resistance and revenge the left's plot to remake america out today go get it the federal reserve loves watching our manufacturers struggle with their exports to the benefit of other parts of the world has anyone looked at what almost all other countries are doing to take advantage of the good old usa our fed has been calling it wrong for too long 100percent confirmed  wow yet another big storm heading to puerto rico will it ever end congress approved 92 billion dollars for puerto rico last year an all time record of its kind for anywhere the g-7 was a great success for the usa and all lamestream media coverage bore no relationship to what actually happened in france fake news it was great no bedbugs at doral the radical left democrats upon hearing that the perfectly located for the next g-7 doral national miami was under consideration for the next g-7 spread that false and nasty rumor not nice starting to look good for the highly respected prime minister of the italian republic giuseppe conte represented italy powerfully at the g-7 loves his country greatly  works well with the usa a very talented man who will hopefully remain prime minister i have gotten to know president  well in our dealings with brazil he is working very hard on the amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of brazil not easy he and his country have the full and complete support of the usa can you believe it i'm at 94percent approval in the republican party and have three stooges running against me one is mr appalachian trail who was actually in argentina for bad reasons just returned to washington from france and the very successful g-7 only to find that the fake news is still trying to perpetuate the phony story that i wanted to use nuclear weapons to blow up hurricanes before they reach shore this is so ridiculous never happened starting to look good for the highly respected prime minister of the italian republic giuseppi conte represented italy powerfully at the g-7 loves his country greatly  works well with the usa a very talented man who will hopefully remain prime minister thank you mark  i agree 100percent  thank you france🇺🇸🇫🇷  just wrapped up a great meeting with my friend prime minister  of india at the  in biarritz

meetings at the  in biarritz france   thank you eric so true  usmca make it bipartisan everybody wants it  jesse  emma great news congratulations  happy birthday vince  the question i was asked most today by fellow world leaders who think the usa is doing so well and is stronger than ever before happens to be mr president why does the american media hate your country so much why are they rooting for it to fail big trade deal just agreed to with prime minister abe of japan will be great for our farmers ranchers and more really big corn purchase so  gives crooked hillary the questions and now

morning with prime minister  at the hôtel du palais in biarritz france   such false and inaccurate reporting thus far on the g-7 the fake news knows this but they can't help themselves leaving now to have breakfast with boris j bad economic times the worse the better anything to make my election more difficult to win well we are having very good meetings the leaders are getting along very well and our country economically is doing great the talk of the world before i arrived in france the fake and disgusting news was saying that relations with the 6 others countries in the g-7 are very tense and that the two days of meetings will be a disaster just like they are trying to force a recession they are trying to will america into the media is destroying the free press mark levin so true thank you both sooo nice  france and president  have done a really great job thus far with a very important g-7 lunch with emmanuel was the best meeting we have yet had likewise evening meeting with world leaders went very well progress being made our great economy is the talk of everyone north carolina governor cooper vetoed a bill that would have required sheriffs to cooperate with ice this is a terrible decision for the great people of north carolina he should reverse his decision and get back to the basics of fighting crime looking forward to helping new york city and governor  complete the long anticipated and partially built second avenue subway would be extended to east 125th street in harlem long in the making they now have the team that can get it done just had lunch with french president  many good things are happening for both of our countries big weekend with other world leaders face it you probably got a tax cut this was a new york times headline and it is very true if republicans take back the house and keep the senate and presidency one of our first acts will be to approve a major middle income tax cut democrats only want to raise your taxes having fun i was smiling as i looked up and around the many reporters with me were smiling also they knew the truthand yet when i saw the reporting cnn msnbc and other fake news outlets covered it as serious news  me thinking of myself as the messiah no more trust when i looked up to the sky and jokingly said i am the chosen one at a press conference two days ago referring to taking on trade with china little did i realize that the media would claim that i had a messiah complex they knew i was kidding being sarcastic and just france and president  have done a really great job thus far with a very important g-7 lunch with emanuel was the best meeting we have yet had likewise evening meeting with world leaders went very well progress being made for all of the fake news reporters that don't have a clue as to what the law is relative to presidential powers china etc try looking at the emergency economic powers act of 1977 case closed just had lunch with french president  many good things are happening for both of our countries big weekend with other world leaders such a sad and pathetic fall for  and jeff z  other good polls also in fifties despite only fake news and then phony polls by ap cnn nbc and as always fox who were way off on 2016 election  disgraceful  thank you ivanka really amazing  looking forward to being with great leaders in france leaving soon  highest condolences thank you vp  great going harris  great he said maga country did it so terrible  thank you to  for the really nice words and thoughts on  tonight hosted by lou's friend  great job by all ps check out these two great women on tour tomorrow night in nyc at the marriott marquis hotel broadway have fun just spoke with president  of brazil our future trade prospects are very exciting and our relationship is strong perhaps stronger than ever before i told him if the united states can help with the amazon rainforest fires we stand ready to assist additionally the remaining 300 billion dollars of goods and products from china that was being taxed from september 1st at 10percent will now be taxed at 15percent thank you for your attention to this matter unfair trading relationship china should not have put new tariffs on 75 billion dollars of united states product politically motivated starting on october 1st the 250 billion dollars of goods and products from china currently being taxed at 25percent will be taxed at 30percent sadly past administrations have allowed china to get so far ahead of fair and balanced trade that it has become a great burden to the american taxpayer as president i can no longer allow this to happen in the spirit of achieving fair trade we must balance this very for many years china and many other countries has been taking advantage of the united states on trade intellectual property theft and much more our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to china with no end in sight the dow is down 573 points perhaps on the news that representative seth moulton whoever that may be has dropped out of the 2020 presidential race all deliveries of fentanyl from china or anywhere else fentanyl kills 100000 americans a year president xi said this would stop it didn't our economy because of our gains in the last 2 1/2 years is much larger than that of china we will keep it that way your companies home and making your products in the usa i will be responding to china's tariffs this afternoon this is a great opportunity for the united states also i am ordering all carriers including fed ex amazon ups and the post office to search for  refuse better off without them the vast amounts of money made and stolen by china from the united states year after year for decades will and must stop our great american companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to china including bringing our country has lost stupidly trillions of dollars with china over many years they have stolen our intellectual property at a rate of hundreds of billions of dollars a year  they want to continue i won't let that happen we don't need china and frankly would be far my only question is who is our bigger enemy jay powell or chairman xi as usual the fed did nothing it is incredible that they can speak without knowing or asking what i am doing which will be announced shortly we have a very strong dollar and a very weak fed i will work brilliantly with both and the us will do great now the fed can show their stuff this despite the fake news and polls  willing to lose their wealth or a big part of it just for the possibility of winning the election but it won't work because i always find a way to win especially for the people the greatest political movement in the history of our country will have another big win in 2020 the economy is strong and good whereas the rest of the world is not doing so well despite this the fake news media together with their partner the democrat party are working overtime to convince people that we are in or will soon be going into a recession they are 94percent approval rating within the  republican party thank you happy birthday james   has done a fantastic job representing the people of colorado he really knows how to win strong on crime borders  the 2nd a cory fights hard for our military  vets john hickenlooper is badly damaged after his horrible run for president big primary trouble my only question is who is our bigger enemy jay powel or chairman xi as usual the fed did nothing it is incredible that they can speak without knowing or asking what i am doing which will be announced shortly we have a very strong dollar and a very weak fed i will work brilliantly with both and the us will do great congratulations to the great bob cousy  looking forward to soon being in north carolina to hold a big rally for wonderful dan bishop who is running for congress his opponent wants open borders sanctuary cities and socialism he likes the squad more than north carolina dan has my full and complete endorsement check out a fantastic new book still winning  why america went all in on donald trump-and why we must do it again by the great writer  an excellent read thank you i am hopeful congress will engage with my team to pass meaningful legislation that will make a real difference and most importantly save lives just concluded a very good meeting on preventing mass shootings talks are ongoing w/ both republicans  democrats we are likewise engaging with lawful gun owners survivors grieving family members law enforcement the nra mental health professionals and school officials just heard that sean spicer will be on dancing with the stars he will do great a terrific person who loves our country dearly the economy is doing really well the federal reserve can easily make it record setting the question is being asked why are we paying much more in interest than germany and certain other countries be early for a change not late let america win big rather than just win germany sells 30 year bonds offering negative yields germany competes with the usa our federal reserve does not allow us to do what we must do they put us at a disadvantage against our competition strong dollar no inflation they move like quicksand fight or go home thank you   it was my honor to sign a presidential memorandum facilitating the cancellation of student loan debt for 25k of our most severely disabled veterans with today's order we express the everlasting love  loyalty of a truly grateful nation god bless our vets  god bless america  great  interviewed on  tonight at 9:00 pm   that when this administration's alternative is no longer available california will squeeze them to a point of business ruin only reason california is now talking to them is because the feds are giving a far better alternative which is much better for consumers henry ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car that is far less safe and doesn't work as well because execs don't want to fight california regulators car companies should know the legendary henry ford and alfred p sloan the founders of ford motor company and general motors are rolling over at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good and cost $3000 more to consumers crazy tax cuts deregulation and an administration dedicated to growing business have allowed the us economy to flourish the resulting surge in job creation and record low unemployment has put the american worker in the driver's seat    very unfair to the united states  because of me these countries have agreed to pay one hundred billion dollars more but still way short of what they should pay for the incredible military protection provided sorry for the record denmark is only at 135percent of gdp for nato spending they are a wealthy country and should be at 2percent we protect europe and yet only 8 of the 28 nato countries are at the 2percent mark the united states is at a much much higher level than that on my way to the great commonwealth of kentucky to deliver remarks at the  75th annual national convention look forward to being with all of my friends   where is the federal reserve so germany is paying zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money while the us a far stronger and more important credit is paying interest and just stopped i hope quantitative tightening strongest dollar in history very tough on exports no inflation my proposal to the politically correct automobile companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000 while at the same time making the cars substantially safer engines would run smoother very little impact on the environment foolish executives we are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate and we should be lower than them yesterday highest dollar in ushistory no inflation wake up federal reserve such growth potential almost like never before doing great with china and other trade deals the only problem we have is jay powell and the fed he's like a golfer who can't putt has no touch big us growth if he does the right thing big cut but don't count on him so far he has called it wrong and only let us down the fake news lamestream media is doing everything possible the create a us recession even though the numbers  facts are working totally in the opposite direction they would be willing to hurt many people but that doesn't matter to them our economy is sooo strong sorry the speed bump has been missteps by the federal reserve     so true the speed bump has been missteps by the federal reserve     so true rep tlaib wants to cut off aid to israel this is the new face the of democrat party read the aoc plus 3 statements on their hatred of jews and israel check out rep omar the great people of minnesota won't stand for this brandon judd president national border patrol council this will effectively end catch and release and curb illegal entries all jews blacks gays everyone and importantly he's good for everyone in america who

israel in the history of the world not just america he is the best president for israel in the history of the worldand the jewish people in israel love him the prime minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the united states and denmark by being so direct i thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future denmark is a very special country with incredible people but based on prime minister mette frederiksen's comments that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of greenland i will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time congratulations  and  on the birth of carolina dorothy trump so proud  sorry i don't buy rep tlaib's tears i have watched her violence craziness and most importantly words for far too long now tears she hates israel and all jewish people she is an anti-semite she and her 3 friends are the new face of the democrat party live with it the lamestream media is far beyond fake news they are treading in very dangerous territory  thank you  just another disgruntled former employee who got fired for gross incompetence  ratings are way down lost all credibility beautiful to watch  maria despite all of their will and energy it won't work  thank you mike  two incredible people i can't believe they're not working few work harder  the fake and corrupt media is sooo bad for our country the enemy of the people  congratulations great show  thank you jon working hard  nobody ever heard of this dope until he met me he only lasted 11 days  i promise not to do this to

importantly for india and pakistan to work towards reducing tensions in kashmir a tough situation but good conversations thank you   massive overflow crowds in new hampshire last week couldn't get into packed snhu arena fake and corrupt news would like you to believe otherwise make america great again  wow report just out google manipulated from 26 million to 16 million votes for hillary clinton in 2016 election this was put out by a clinton supporter not a trump supporter google should be sued my victory was even bigger than thought  the fed rate over a fairly short period of time should be reduced by at least 100 basis points with perhaps some quantitative easing as well if that happened our economy would be even better and the world economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced-good for everyone our economy is very strong despite the horrendous lack of vision by jay powell and the fed but the democrats are trying to will the economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 election  very selfish our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world democrats want open borders and crime so dangerous for our country but we are building a big beautiful new wall i will protect america the dems don't know where to start  got fired wrote a very nice book about me just recently now the book is a lie said his wife was driving him crazy

was with other candidates in the primary who got shellacked  then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign i barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool of himself bad on tv abused staff great cohesion inside the republican party the best i have ever seen despite all of the fake news my poll numbers are great new internal polls show them to be the strongest we've

happening with her getting divorced he was a mental wreck we didn't want him around now fake news puts him on like he was my buddy anthony scaramucci is a highly unstable nut job who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellaced and then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign i barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool of himself bad on tv abused

liability i'm fairly certain they'll endorse me just to keep it all going thank you  i couldn't agree more  house democrats want to take action against israel because it is fighting back against two maybe four people that have said unthinkably bad things about it  the israeli people dems have such disdain for israel what happened aoc plus 4 is the new face of the democrat party our economy is the best in the world by far lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories poised for big growth after trade deals are completed import prices down china eating tariffs helping targeted farmers

you we will never forgive or forget  biden doesn't have a clue i will solve the china problem  the fake news media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my re-election the problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on trade and everyone knows that including china representatives omar and tlaib are the face of the democrat party and they hate israel wow the deputy editor of the failing new york times was just demoted should have been fired totally biased and inaccurate reporting the paper is a fraud zero credibility fake news takes another hit but this time a big one our great farmers know how important it is to win on trade they will be the big winners the united states is now by far the biggest strongest and most powerful economy in the world it is not even close as others falter we will only get stronger consumers are in the best shape ever plenty of cash business optimism is at an all time high if president xi would meet directly and personally with the protesters there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the hong kong problem i have no doubt  it would show great weakness if israel allowed rep omar and reptlaib to visit they hate israel  all jewish people  there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds minnesota and michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office they are a disgrace the philadelphia shooter should never have been allowed to be on the streets he had a long and very dangerous criminal record looked like he was having a good time after his capture and after wounding so many police long sentence must get much tougher on street crime what they were doing there's plenty of indication we don't have to speculate  holy cow got to read this book  wow    a very serious situation can never be allowed to happen again drain the swamp go out and get andrew mccarthy's new book ball of collusion supervision became the investigator and when they pushed the envelope there was nobody there to tell them no it goes right to the president obama plenty of information that obama was informed  knew exactly thank you and the wall is under major construction  two great entertainers and more importantly great people check out their show  i know president xi of china very well he is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people he is also a good man in a tough business i have zero doubt that if president xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the hong kong problem he can do it personal meeting deferral to december it actually helps china more than us but will be reciprocated millions of jobs are being lost in china to other non-tariffed countries thousands of companies are leaving of course china wants to make a deal let them work humanely with hong kong first good things were stated on the call with china the other day they are eating the tariffs with the devaluation of their currency and pouring money into their system the american consumer is fine with or without the september date but much good will come from the short sad  unlike others our economy is strong  spread is way too much as other countries say thank you to clueless jay powell and the federal reserve germany and many others are playing the game crazy inverted yield curve we should easily be reaping big rewards  gains but the fed is holding us back we will win we are winning big time against china companies  jobs are fleeing prices to us have not gone up and in some cases have come down china is not our problem though hong kong is not helping our problem is with the fed raised too much  too fast now too slow to cut the great charles payne  correctly stated that fed chair jay powell made two enormous mistakes 1 when he said mid cycle adjustment 2 we're data dependent  he did not do the right thing i agree to put it mildly  tremendous amounts of money pouring into the united states people want safety so far you've had tariffs imposed on 300 billion dollars worth of chinese products but you can't tell me that it has hurt our economy it really hasn't led to any kind of serious rise in prices at the consumer level     and we are taking in $billions the fed has got to do something the fed is the central bank of the united states not the central bank of the world mark grant    correct the federal reserve acted far too quickly and now is very very late too bad so much to gain on the upside join me tomorrow night in manchester new hampshire at 7:00 pm eastern   a fighter and champion great  rt

 and who make america proud no one in the world does it better than you  no debate on election security should go forward without first agreeing that voter id identification must play a very strong part in any final agreement without voter id it is all so meaningless thank you bill  true without being stuck at an airport where cnn buys at a big price an uninterested audience they've got nothing going  is bad for america  it always happens when a conservative does even a fraction of what chris cuomo did with his lunatic ranting raving  cursing they get destroyed by the fake news but when a liberal democrat like chris cuomo does it republicans immediately come to his defense we never learn see you in new hampshire  just leaving incredible complex jobs jobs jobs  so terrible  put it back up we are living with a rigged  fake media  just landed in pennsylvania looking forward to making a speech on energy so important our intelligence has informed us that the chinese government is moving troops to the border with hong kong everyone should be calm and safe many are blaming me and the united states for the problems going on in hong kong i can't imagine why all the news that's not fit to print the new york times is no longer the paper we grew up with it is no longer a news organization it is now an agenda driven organization out to change the country for the worse michael goodwin highly respected new york post columnist as usual china said they were going to be buying big from our great american farmers so far they have not done what they said maybe this will be different would chris cuomo be given a red flag for his recent rant filthy language and a total loss of control he shouldn't be allowed to have any weapon he's nuts thank you steve  through massive devaluation of their currency and pumping vast sums of money into their system the tens of billions of dollars that the us is receiving is a gift from china prices not up no inflation farmers getting more than

patriot is considering a run for congress in arizona terrific   rt  this is cnn   the united states is learning much from the failed missile explosion in russia we have similar though more advanced technology the russian skyfall explosion has people worried about the air around the facility and far beyond not good two great and loyal friends  scaramucci who like so many others had nothing to do with my election victory is only upset that i didn't want him back in the administration where he desperately wanted to be also i seldom had time to return his many calls to me he just wanted to be on tv rt  they call it thursday at the amazon washington post  washington post 'embarrassed' over gaffe-filled story needing thank you negop  many incredible things are happening right now for our country after years of being ripped off by other nations on both trade deals and the military things are changing fast big progress is being made america is respected again keep america great tv talent then during the 2016 election i would watch as joe scarborough  his very angry psycho wife would push donny to the point of total humiliation he would never fight back because he wanted to stay on tv even on a very low rated show all in the name of ambition so funny to watch little donny deutsch on tv with his own failing show when i did the apprentice donny would call me along with   others and beg to be on that very successful show he had the tv bug  i would let him come on though he  erin had very little other than the fact that this administration has probably done more than any other administration in its first 2 1/2 years of existence anthony who would do anything to come back in should remember the only reason he is on tv and it's not for being the mooch anthony scaramucci who was quickly terminated 11 days from a position that he was totally incapable of handling now seems to do nothing but television as the all time expert on president trump like many other so-called television experts he knows very little about me joe biden just said we believe in facts not truth does anybody really believe he is mentally fit to be president we are playing in a very big and complicated world joe doesn't have a clue think how wonderful it is to be able to fight back and show to so many how totally dishonest the fake news media really is it may be the most corrupt and disgusting business almost there is make america great again china wants to make a deal so badly thousands of companies are leaving because of the tariffs they must stem the flow at the same time china may be hoping for a democrat to win so they could continue the great ripoff of america  the theft of hundreds of billions of $'s cause big disruption by going to manhattan working almost all of the time including evenings don't have to be in wh to do thatand sooo many other false statements he is right about one thing though i will win again in 2020 otherwise he pays 95percent in taxes got to see by accident wacko comedian bill maher's show so many lies he said patients in el paso hospital didn't want to meet with me wrong had really great meetings with numerous patients said i was on vacation wrong long planned fix up of wh stay here rather than never has the press been more inaccurate unfair or corrupt we are not fighting the democrats they are easy we are fighting the seriously dishonest and unhinged lamestream media they have gone totally crazy make america great again also a small apology for testing the short range missiles and that this testing would stop when the exercises end i look forward to seeing kim jong un in the not too distant future a nuclear free north korea will lead to one of the most successful countries in the world in a letter to me sent by kim jong un he stated very nicely that he would like to meet and start negotiations as soon as the joint us/south korea joint exercise are over it was a long letter much of it complaining about the ridiculous and expensive exercises it was maggie haberman of the failing  reported that i was annoyed by the lack of cameras inside the hospitals in dayton  el paso when in fact i was the one who stated very strongly that i didn't want the fake news inside  told my people not to let them in fake reporting rt  breaking documents were unsealed yesterday revealing that top democrats including bill clinton took private trips to to inflame and cause chaos they create their own violence and then try to blame others they are the true racists and are very bad for our country liberal hollywood is racist at the highest level and with great anger and hate they like to call themselves elite but they are not elite in fact it is often the people that they so strongly oppose that are actually the elite the movie coming out is made in order mentally ill or deranged people i am the biggest second amendment person there is but we all must work together for the good and safety of our country common sense things can be done that are good for everyone serious discussions are taking place between house and senate leadership  on meaningful background checks i have also been speaking to the nra and others so that their very strong views can be fully represented and respected guns should not be placed in the hands of rt  imagine living in a time when a national newspaper revises its front page headline because the lefties can't handle truth rt  listen to my chat with maggie haberman from the failing ‘why has the failing nyt changed its headline'  rod blagojevich the former governor of illinois was sentenced to 14 years in prison he has served 7 years many people have asked that i study the possibility of commuting his sentence in that it was a very severe one white house staff is continuing the review of this matter career in the military retiring from the us navy in 2010 he commanded at every level including the naval special warfare command he has also served as a national security fellow at harvard university i have no doubt he will do a great job i am pleased to inform you that the honorable joseph maguire current director of the national counterterrorism center will be named acting director of national intelligence effective august 15th admiral maguire has a long and distinguished coincides with the retirement of dan coats a new acting director of national intelligence will be named shortly sue gordon is a great professional with a long and distinguished career i have gotten to know sue over the past 2 years and have developed great respect for her sue has announced she will be leaving on august 15 which i know emmanuel means well as do all others but nobody speaks for the united states but the united states itself no one is authorized in any way shape or form to represent us iran is in serious financial trouble they want desperately to talk to the us but are given mixed signals from all of those purporting to represent us including president macron of france in the world there is nobody even close but unfortunately the same cannot be said about our federal reserve they have called it wrong at every step of the way and we are still winning can you imagine what would happen if they actually called it right john deere our car companies  others to compete on a level playing field with substantial fed cuts there is no inflation and no quantitative tightening the dollar will make it possible for our companies to win against any competition we have the greatest companies as your president one would think that i would be thrilled with our very strong dollar i am not the fed's high interest rate level in comparison to other countries is keeping the dollar high making it more difficult for our great manufacturers like caterpillar boeing i don't know who juaquin castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate 1percent who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth juaquin is not the man that his brother is but his brother according to most is not much keep fighting juaquin i am so amazed that msnbc  cnn can keep putting on over and over again people that have no idea what i am all about and yet they speak as experts on trump same people since long before the 2016 election and how did that work out for the haters and losers not well just watched a world class loser tim o'brien who i haven't seen or spoken to in many years  knows nothing about me except that he wrote a failed hit piece book about me 15 years ago fired like a dog from other jobs saw him on lyin' brian williams trump slam show bad tv my time spent in dayton and el paso with some of the greatest people on earth thank you for a job well done  incredible afternoon in el paso texas we love you and are with you all the way  the dems new weapon is actually their old weapon one which they never cease to use when they are down or run out of facts racism they are truly disgusting they even used it on nancy pelosi i will be putting out a list of all people who have been so ridiculously accused leaving el paso for the white house what great people i met there and in dayton ohio the fake news worked overtime trying to disparage me and the two trips but it just didn't work the love respect  enthusiasm were there for all to see they have been through so much sad i don't know who joaquin castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate 1percent who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth joaquin is not the man that his brother is but his brother according to most is not much keep fighting joaquin the people i met today in dayton are the finest anywhere  we love you dayton ohio  watching fake news cnn is better than watching shepard smith the lowest rated show on  actually whenever possible i turn to  misrepresenting what took place inside of the hospital their news conference after i left for el paso was a fraud it bore no resemblance to what took place with those incredible people that i was so lucky to meet and spend time with they were all amazingo just left dayton ohio where i met with the victims  families law enforcement medical staff  first responders it was a warm  wonderful visit tremendous enthusiasm  even love then i saw failed presidential candidate 0percent sherrod brown  mayor whaley totally watching sleepy joe biden making a speech sooo boring the lamestream media will die in the ratings and clicks with this guy it will be over for them not to mention the fact that our country will do poorly with him it will be one big crash but at least china will be happy today we honor all of our country's purple heart recipients their loved ones and our gold star families for their immeasurable sacrifice these american patriots represent the unyielding and unmatched strength and determination of the us armed forces   terrible thing to watch especially when things could be taken care of sooo easily we will win anyway but it would be much easier if the fed understood which they don't that we are competing against other countries all of whom want to do well at our expense proud to admit their mistake of acting too fast and tightening too much and that i was right they must cut rates bigger and faster and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening now yield curve is at too wide a margin and no inflation incompetence is a three more central banks cut rates our problem is not china we are stronger than ever money is pouring into the us while china is losing companies by the thousands to other countries and their currency is under siege our problem is a federal reserve that is too meanwhile the dayton ohio shooter had a history of supporting political figures like bernie sanders elizabeth warren and antifa   i hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to fake news thank you this is an astounding development in journalism i've never seen it happen before i've just never seen anything like this is that journalism today i don't think so mark penn former clinton advisor  after 3 years i almost got a good headline from the times trump urges unity vs racism was the correct description in the first headline by the failing new york times but it was quickly changed to assailing hate but not guns after the radical left democrats went absolutely crazy fake news that's what we're up against talks have begun to further increase payments to the united states south korea is a very wealthy nation that now feels an obligation to contribute to the military defense provided by the united states of america the relationship between the two countries is a very good one south korea has agreed to pay substantially more money to the united states in order to defend itself from north korea over the past many decades the us has been paid very little by south korea but last year at the request of president trump south korea paid $990000000 beto phony name to indicate hispanic heritage o'rourke who is embarrassed by my last visit to the great state of texas where i trounced him and is now even more embarrassed by polling at 1percent in the democrat primary should respect the victims  law enforcement  be quiet amendment john yoo   former governor jerry brown vetoed the same bill in that it was ridiculous and totally unconstitutional just more of the record setting presidential harassment don't feel badly new york state is far worse california is trying to meddle with a ballot in order to oppose president trump and it's clearly something california is not allowed to do it violates the right of the republican party or any party to choose its leaders under the free speech clause and under the 14th will be going to dayton ohio and el paso texas tomorrow to meet with first responders law enforcement and some of the victims of the terrible shootings in 2020 lou dobbs stated that this is a fraud on the american public  stated with certainty that they suppressed negative stories on hillary clinton and boosted negative stories on donald trump all very illegal we are watching google very closely  are not planning to illegally subvert the 2020 election despite all that has been said to the contrary it all sounded good until i watched kevin cernekee a google engineer say terrible things about what they did in 2016 and that they want to make sure that trump losses  of google was in the oval office working very hard to explain how much he liked me what a great job the administration is doing that google was not involved with china's military that they didn't help crooked hillary over me in the 2016 election  that they thank you    thank you mr wonderful i like you too    as they have learned in the last two years our great american farmers know that china will not be able to hurt them in that their president has stood with them and done what no other president would do and i'll do it again next year if necessary massive amounts of money from china and other parts of the world is pouring into the united states for reasons of safety investment and interest rates we are in a very strong position companies are also coming to the us in big numbers a beautiful thing to watch in 2020 lou dobbs stated that this is a fraud on the american public  stated with certainty that they suppressed negative stories on hillary

me in the 2016 election and that they it's political season and the election is around the corner they want to continue to push that racist narrative    and i am the least racist person black hispanic and asian unemployment is the lowest best in the history of the united states did george bush ever condemn president obama after sandy hook president obama had 32 mass shootings during his reign not many people said obama is out of control mass shootings were happening before the president even thought about running for pres   thank you   check out what  is up to for the 2020 election   thank you  and tom homan  we must honor the sacred memory of those we have lost by acting as one people open wounds cannot heal if we are divided we must seek real bipartisan solutions that will truly make

this capital punishment be delivered quickly decisively and without years of needless delay  the first lady and i join all americans in praying and grieving for the victims their families and the survivors we will stand by their side forever  china is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of billions of dollars they have been taking from the us with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation so one-sided it should have been stopped many years ago used currency manipulation to steal our businesses and factories hurt our jobs depress our workers' wages and harm our farmers' prices not anymore based on the historic currency manipulation by china it is now even more obvious to everyone that americans are not paying for the tariffs  they are being paid for compliments of china and the us is taking in tens of billions of dollars china has always china dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low it's called currency manipulation are you listening

chariman kim has a great and beautiful vision for his country and only the united states with me as president can make that vision come true he will do the right thing because he is far too smart not to and he does not want to disappoint his friend president trump chairman kim does not want to disappoint me with a violation of trust there is far too much for north korea to gain the potential as a country under kim jong un's leadership is unlimited also there is far too much to lose i may be wrong but i believe that kim jong un and north korea tested 3 short range missiles over the last number of days these missiles tests are not a violation of our signed singapore agreement nor was there discussion of short range missiles when we shook hands there may be a united nations violation but

from china into our country this does not include the 250 billion dollars already tariffed at 25percent buy agricultural product from the us in large quantities but did not do so additionally my friend president xi said that he would stop the sale of fentanyl to the united states  this never happened and many americans continue to die trade talks are continuing and our representatives have just returned from china where they had constructive talks having to do with a future trade deal we thought we had a deal with china three months ago but sadly china decided to re-negotiate the deal prior to signing more recently china agreed to a string of court cases that have been run through the legal system that have hit dead ends    big rally tonight in cincinnati ohio see you there ps our

the people on the stage tonight and last were not those that will either make america great again or keep america great our country now is breaking records in almost every category from stock market to military to unemployment we have prosperity  success like never before the cages for kids were built by the obama administration in 2014 he had the policy of child separation i ended it even as i realized that more families would then come to the border  experts stated that the fed should not have tightened and then waited too long to undo their mistake james bullard of st louis fed said they waited too long to correct the mistake that they made last december mistake powell cut rate and then he started talking  very low ratings for the democratic debate last night  they're desperate for trump thank you bill say hello to our great veterans  the radical left dems went after me for using the words drug-infested concerning baltimore take a look at elijah c  the 99percent get a bigger raise  as usual powell let us down but at least he is ending quantitative tightening which shouldn't have started in the first place no inflation we are winning anyway but i am certainly not getting much help from the federal reserve what the market wanted to hear from jay powell and the federal reserve was that this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive rate-cutting cycle which would keep pace with china the european union and other countries around the world i am very happy for eddie gallagher and his family to information that may have been obtained from opposing lawyers and for giving immunity in a totally incompetent fashion i have directed the secretary of the navy richard spencer  chief of naval operations john richardson to immediately withdraw and rescind the awards the prosecutors who lost the case against seal eddie gallagher who i released from solitary confinement so he could fight his case properly were ridiculously given a navy achievement medal not only did they lose the case they had difficulty with respect or is he too dumb stupid} to understand that no wonder cnn's ratings msnbc's also have gone down the tubes and will stay there until they bring credibility back to the newsroom don't hold your breath cnn's don lemon the dumbest man on television insinuated last night while asking a debate question that i was a racist when in fact i am the least racist person in the world perhaps someone should explain to don that he is supposed to be neutral unbiased  fair lowering drug prices for many americans including our great seniors at my direction   just released a safe importation action plan our governors will be very happy too    the lesser of two socialists is still a socialist senator john kennedy of louisiana if i hadn't won the 2016 election we would be in a great recession/depression right now the people i saw on stage last night  you can add in sleepy joe harris  the rest will lead us into an economic sinkhole the likes of which we have never seen before with me only up such a great victory in court yesterday on the russian hoax the greatest political scam in the history of our country treason hopefully the attorney generel of the united states and all of those working with him will find out in great detail what happened never again i have directed the secretary of the navy richard spencer and chief of naval operations john richardson to immediately withdraw and rescind the awards i am very happy for eddie gallagher and his family not only did they lose the case they had difficulty with respect to information that may have been obtained from opposing lawyers and for giving immunity in a totally incompetent fashion the prosecutors who lost the case against seal eddie gallagher who i released from solitary confinement so he could fight his case properly were ridiculously given a navy achievement medal vindication  exoneration from the russian wikileaks and every other form of hoax perpetrated by the dnc radical democrats and others this is really big stuff especially coming from a highly respected judge who was appointed by president clinton the witch hunt ends wow a federal judge in the southern district of ny completely dismissed a lawsuit brought by the democratic national committee against our historic 2016 campaign for president the judge said the dnc case was entirely divorced from the facts yet another total  complete thank you eric  thank you amy  we should immediately pass voter id  to insure the safety and sanctity of our voting system also paper ballots as backup old fashioned but true thank you great reception in jamestown by both republicans  democrats respect for our country's incredible heritage thank you heading to jamestown virginia word is the democrats will make it as uncomfortable as possible but that's ok because today is not about them don't watch show but heard mika said i asked to preside over their marriage not truedoes anyone really believe that they were married by elijah king of baltimore just reminded my staff that morning joe  psycho were with me in my room at their request the night i won new hampshire likewise followed me to other states china has lost 5 million jobs and two million manufacturing jobs due to the trump tariffs trumps got china back on its heels and the united states is doing great   senate is working hard on america's transportation infrastructure act will have big impact on our highways and roads all across our nation interest strong from republicans and democrats do i hear the beautiful word bipartisan get it done i am with you  wow morning joe  psycho ratings have really crashed very small audience people are tired of hearing fake news delivered with an anger that is not to be believed sad when the show was sane they helped get me elected thanks was on all the time lost all of its juice to ripoff the usa even bigger and better than ever before the problem with them waiting however is that if  when i win the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating nowor no deal at all we have all the cards our past leaders never got it my team is negotiating with them now but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit they should probably wait out our election to see if we get one of the democrat stiffs like sleepy joe then they could make a great deal like in past 30 years and continue china is doing very badly worst year in 27 was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now no signs that they are doing so that is the problem with china they just don't come through our economy has become much larger than the chinese economy is last 3 years despite the democrats wanting very unsafe open borders  refusing to change the loopholes  asylum tremendous progress is being made the the southern border we all waited because we assumed the dems would ultimately be forced to change the horrible immigration lawsthey didn't somali refugees arresed in tucson on way to egypt they were in touch with an agent posing as a terrorist one of them stated the best wake up call is islamic state to get victory or another 9/11 get smart people    rt    democrats are the only ones interfering in our elections 🤨 why do you think they so strongl i don't know what it's going to take a lot of democratic run cities all over america look like this it's not just baltimore unfortunately kimberly klacik baltimore journalist  remember vote for trump what the h do you have to lose best unemployment numbers baltimore's numbers are the worst in the united states on crime and the economy billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years but to no avail the money was stolen or wasted ask elijah cummings where it went he should investigate himself with his oversight committee elijah cummings never even went to the southern border and then he screams at the very good people who despite congresses failure to fix the loopholes and asylum make it work crossings are way down and the wall is being built even with zero dem help border getting strong she loves our military and our vets and protects our second amendment cindy has my full and total endorsement  senator cindy hyde-smith is doing a great job for the people of mississippi and fully supports our  agenda cindy is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration just remember the iranians never won a war but never lost a negotiation he is tough on crime strong on borders and will fight for our second amendment daniel will never let you down he has my full and complete endorsement the republican party has a new star his name is daniel cameron  and he is running for attorney general of the commonwealth of kentucky it is the 25th anniversary of a great organization run by people who truly love our country  on behalf of all americans i thank them   looking forward to my meeting at 2:00 pm with wonderful inner city pastors countries that know how to play the game against the us that's actually why the eu was formedand for china until now the us has been easy pickens the fed has made all of the wrong moves a small rate cut is not enough but we will win anyway the fed raised way too early and way too much their quantitative tightening was another big mistake while our country is doing very well the potential wealth creation that was missed especially when measured against our debt is staggering we are competing with other even to new heights of success and glory but not with king elijah and that crew when the leaders of baltimore want to see the city rise again i am in a very beautiful oval shaped office waiting for your call crazy bernie sanders recently equated the city of baltimore to a third world country based on that statement i assume that bernie must now be labeled a racist just as a republican would if he used that term and standard the fact is baltimore can be brought back maybe the eu and china will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product in the meantime and with very low inflation our fed does nothing and probably will do very little by comparison too bad al sharpton would always ask me to go to his events he would say it's a personal favor to me seldom but sometimes i would go it was fine he came to my office in tt during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me just a conman at work if the democrats are going to defend the radical left squad and king elijah's baltimore fail it will be a long road to 2020 the good news for the dems is that they have the fake news media in their pocket baltimore under the leadership of elijah cummings has the worst crime statistics in the nation 25 years of all talk no action so tired of listening to the same old bullnext reverend al will show up to complain  protest nothing will get done for the people in need sad i have known al for 25 years went to fights with him  don king always got along well he loved trump he would ask me for favors often al is a con man a troublemaker always looking for a score just doing his thing must have intimidated comcast/nbc hates whites  cops  good luck with the book george should do well  law enforcement is at the scene of shootings in gilroy california reports are that shooter has not yet been apprehended be careful and safe the democrats hate this president so much they're forgetting about their duty to secure our border    sad but true if the democrats would have closed the loopholes two years ago when president trump asked them to do so none of this stuff would have happened  be leaving office on august 15th i would like to thank dan for his great service to our country the acting director will be named shortly i am pleased to announce that highly respected congressman john ratcliffe of texas will be nominated by me to be the director of national intelligence a former us attorney john will lead and inspire greatness for the country he loves dan coats the current director will under the trump administration african american unemployment is the lowest best in the history of the united states no president has come close to doing this before i also created successful opportunity zones waiting for nancy and elijah to say thank you mr president if racist elijah cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district and baltimore itself perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership his radical oversight is a joke there is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know that elijah cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district and of baltimore itself dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts shame elijah cummings has had his chance to address it crime  conditions in baltimore for decades and he hasn't gotten it done    how can he get it done when he just wants to use his oversight committee to hurt innocent people and divide our country speaking of failing badly has anyone seen what is happening to nancy pelosi's district in san francisco it is not even recognizeable lately something must be done before it is too late the dems should stop wasting time on the witch hunt hoax and start focusing on our country a look the facts speak far louder than words the democrats always play the race card when in fact they have done so little for our nation's great african american people now lowest unemployment in us history and only getting better elijah cummings has failed badly someone please explain to nancy pelosi who was recently called racist by those in her own party that there is nothing wrong with bringing out the very obvious fact that congressman elijah cummings has done a very poor job for his district and the city of baltimore just take if it weren't for donald trump we would never know how corrupt these democrats are we would never know for sure that there was a deep state now we know it  rt  trump baltimore is a violent place highest homicide rate in usa /   civilian employee assaulted in stre the democrats are still doing the russians dirty work as they continue to push the fake crime media credibility is now shot democrat credibility is shot they've wasted over 100 hearings on a hoax they've done nothing on infrastructure drug prices trade the real collusion the conspiracy the crime was between the clinton campaign the dnc fusion gps christopher steeleand many others including comey mccabe lisa page and her lover ohr and his wonderful wife and on and on  so sad that elijah cummings has been able to do so little for the people of baltimore statistically baltimore ranks last in almost every major category cummings has done nothing but milk baltimore dry but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing robert mueller's testimony and the mueller report itself was a disaster for this illegal democrat inspired witch hunt it is an embarrassment to the usa that they don't know how to stop they can't help themselves they are totally lost they are clowns one of the biggest things to come out of mueller's testimony was the fact that when he was asked was there anything that impeded your investigation the answer was a clear unequivocal no misty marris    true but many other great exonerating things came out thank you   thank you   thanks     your district   why don't you focus on your district  no collusion no obstruction total exoneration democrat witch hunt we gave nadler and his trump hating dems the complete mueller report we didn't have to and even mueller himself but now that both were a total bust they say it wasn't good enough nothing will ever be good enough for them witch hunt elijah cummings spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through oversight he does nothing for his very poor very dangerous and very badly run district take a look   democrats don't care about border security they refuse to give the votes necessary to fix the loopholes and asylum would be so easy they want open borders which means crimecrimecrime such a big victory of our country supreme court approves trump administration plan to use military funds for the wall   we will be fully reimbursed for this expenditure over time by other countries the dems are now coming out of shock from the terrible mueller performance and are starting to spin impeachment all over again how sick  disgusting and bad for our country are they what they are doing is so wrong but they do it anyway dems have become the do nothing party the democrats were trying mightily to revive the badly  irrevocably tarnished witch hunt hoax until robert mueller put on the greatest display of ineptitude  incompetence that the halls of congress have ever seen truth is he had no facts on his side nothing he could do consideration is being given to declaring antifa the gutless radical left wack jobs who go around hitting only non-fighters people over the heads with baseball bats a major organization of terror along with ms-13  others would make it easier for police to do their job why is so much money sent to the elijah cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the united states no human being would want to live there where is all this money going how much is stolen investigate this corrupt mess immediately as proven last week during a congressional tour the border is clean efficient  well run just very crowded cumming district is a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess if he spent more time in baltimore maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous  filthy place rep elijah cummings has been a brutal bully shouting and screaming at the great men  women of border patrol about conditions at the southern border when actually his baltimore district is far worse and more dangerous his district is considered the worst in the usa wow big victory on the wall the united states supreme court overturns lower court injunction allows southern border wall to proceed big win for border security and the rule of law   puts guatemalan migrants on fast track home  the wto is broken when the world's richest countries claim to be developing countries to avoid wto rules and get special treatment no more today i directed the us trade representative to take action so that countries stop cheating the system at the expense of the usa great morning at the pentagon yesterday congratulations to our new defense secretary mark   france just put a digital tax on our great american technology companies if anybody taxes them it should

report   yesterday changed everything it really did clear the president he wins   it changed everything in favor of the president who said all along this investigation is rooted in nothing mueller was exposed as being best friends with comey today you say appreciate it  thank you  thank you    and  on  moments ago  the witch hunt is over   great job   thank you    thank you rep   thank you rep   thank you   thank you  mccarthy  the media's mueller meltdown   the democrats lost so big today their party is in shambles right now the democrats had nothing impeachment's over   even michael moore agrees that the dems and mueller blew it  the kind of questions the white house correspondents were asking is almost like they didn't see what went on at the hearings   the hearings were a disaster for robert mueller  the democrats nevertheless the fake news media will try to make the best out of it truth is a force of nature i would like to thank the democrats for holding this morning's hearing now after 3 hours robert mueller has to subject himself to  an embarrassment to our country mueller was asked whether or not the investigation was impeded in any way and he said no in other words there was no obstruction   this has been a disaster for the democrats and a disaster for the reputation of robert mueller chris wallace  interview including the vice president of the united states it has been reported that robert mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of fbi director and get turned down the day before he was wrongfully appointed special counsel hope he doesn't say that under oath in that we have numerous witnesses to the keep america great no collusion no obstruction interview including the vice president of the united states it has been reported that robert mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of fbi director and get turned down the day before he was wrongfully appointed special counsel hope he doesn't say that under oath in the we have numerous witnesses to the so why didn't the highly conflicted robert mueller investigate how and why crooked hillary clinton deleted and acid washed 33000 emails immediately after getting a subpoena from the united states congress she must have great lawyers why didn't robert mueller  his band of 18 angry democrats spend any time investigating crooked hillary clinton lyin'  leakin' james comey lisa page and her psycho lover peter s andy mccabe the beautiful ohr family fusion gps and many more  including himself  andrew w it was never agreed that robert mueller could use one of his many democrat never trumper lawyers to sit next to him and help him with his answers this was specifically not agreed to and i would never have agreed to it the greatest witch hunt in us history by far so democrats and others can illegally fabricate a crime try pinning it on a very innocent president and when he fights back against this illegal and treasonous attack on our country they call it obstruction wrong why didn't robert mueller investigate the investigators so robert mueller has now asked for his long time never trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers what's this all about his lawyer represented the basement server guy who got off free in the crooked hillary case this should not be allowed rigged witch hunt the young leaders here today  are part of a movement unlike anything in the history of our nation it is a movement about reclaiming your future rebuilding your country restoring your destiny and renewing the values that are the true source of american greatness  congratulations to our new secretary of defense mark   oh well we still have the great  who i hear has a really strong show tonight 9:00 pm thank you    just watched rep

to be too bad just got back only to hear of a last minute change allowing a never trumper attorney to help robert mueller with his testimony before congress tomorrow what a disgrace to our system never heard of this before very unfair should not be allowed a rigged witch hunt budget deal gives great victories to our military and vets keeps out democrat poison pill riders republicans and democrats in congress need to act asap and support this deal i got to know him over his many years as chairman of the police athletic league for which he devoted so much time and energy bob morgenthau a legend will be greatly missed i was saddened to learn of the recent passing of bob morgenthau a truly great man bob served as a naval officer in world war ii was an extraordinary us attorney manhattan district attorney and always a warrior for our country that he loved so dearly leaving for turning point usa will be speaking to some of the greatest and smartest young people on the planet see you there when an old wall at the southern border that is crumbling and falling over built in an important section to keep out problems is replaced with a brand new 30 foot high steel and concrete wall the media says no new wall has been built fake news building lots of wall in 2016 i almost won minnesota in 2020 because of america hating anti-semite rep omar  the fact that minnesota is having its best economic year ever i will win the state we are going to be a nightmare to the president she say no aoc plus 3 are a nightmare for america tariffs remittance fees or all of the above guatemala has not been good big us taxpayer dollars going to them was cut off by me 9 months ago guatemala which has been forming caravans and sending large numbers of people some with criminal records to the united states has decided to break the deal they had with us on signing a necessary safe third agreement we were ready to go now we are looking at the ban farmers are starting to do great again after 15 years of a downward spiral the 16 billion dollar china replacement money didn't exactly hurt keep america great congratulations to boris johnson on becoming the new prime minister of the united kingdom he will be great best and newest military almost totally rebuilt from the depleted military i took over in history best va in history choice and much much more gee let's impeach the president the squad aoc plus 3 and other dems suffer from trump derangement syndrome crazy newest poll only 11percent in favor of starting ridiculous impeachment hearings well let's see we have the best economy in history the best employment numbers in history most people working in history highest stock market in history biggest tax and regulation cuts in history i completely read the entire mueller report and do you know what i concluded after reading both volume 1 and volume 2 there is no there there no there there we completely wasted everybody's time and taxpayer's money  i completely read the entire mueller report and do you know what i concluded after reading both volume 1 and volume 2 there is no there there no there there we completely wasted everybody's time and taxpayer's money  when we rip down and totally replace a badly broken and dilapidated barrier on the southern border something which cannot do the job the fake news media gives us zero credit for building a new wall we have replaced many miles of old barrier with powerful new walls this was a real compromise in order to give another big victory to our great military and vets i am pleased to announce that a deal has been struck with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell senate minority leader chuck schumer speaker of the house nancy pelosi and house minority leader kevin mccarthy on a two-year budget and debt ceiling with no poison pills the squad is a very racist group of troublemakers who are young inexperienced and not very smart they are pulling the once great democrat party far left and were against humanitarian aid at the borderand are now against ice and homeland security so bad for our country going with first lady to pay our respects to justice stevens leaving now the report of iran capturing cia spies is totally false zero truth just more lies and propaganda like their shot down drone put out by a religious regime that is badly failing and has no idea what to do their economy is dead and will get much worse iran is a total mess but the questions should be asked why were all of clinton's people given immunity and why were the text messages of peter s and his lover lisa page deleted and destroyed right after they left mueller and after we requested themthis is illegal highly conflicted robert mueller should not be given another bite at the apple in the end it will be bad for him and the phony democrats in congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous witch hunt result of the mueller report no collusion no obstruction fake news equals the enemy of the people the mainstream media is out of control they constantly lie and cheat in order to get their radical left democrat views out their for all to see it has never been this bad they have gone bonkers  no longer care what is right or wrong this large scale false reporting is sick except for those stated by me  reams of paper were never given to me it is a made up story meant to demean  belittle the post had no sources the facts remain the same that we have 4 radical left congresswomen who have said very bad things about israel  our country the amazon washington post front page story yesterday was total fake news they said advisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four congresswomen now really does that sound like me what advisors there were no talking points it is far more costly for the federal reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does in the future turn down very inexpensive in fact productive  to move now the fed raised  tightened far too much  too fast in other words they missed it big don't miss it again as we have done it could have been soooo much better interest rate costs should have been much lower  gdp  our country's wealth accumulation much higher such a waste of time  money also very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in with almost no inflation our country is needlessly being forced to pay a much higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided federal reserve in addition quantitative tightening is continuing making it harder for our country to compete as good thank you very much for revealing the incredible facts which the fake news media will never do    based on the comments made by senator schumer he must have seen how dangerous  bad for our country the border is it is not a manufactured crisis as the fake news media  their democrat partners tried to portray he said he wants to meet i will set up a meeting asap senator chuck schumer has finally gone to the southern border with some democrat senators this is a great thing nearby he missed a large group of illegal immigrants trying to enter the usa illegally they wildly  rushed border patrol some agents were badly injured most importantly you have led israel with a commitment to the values of democracy freedom and equal opportunity that both our nations cherish and share congratulations to bibi  on becoming the longest serving pm in the history of israel under your leadership israel has become a technology powerhouse and a world class economy i don't believe the four congresswomen are capable of loving our country they should apologize to america and israel for the horrible hateful things they have said they are destroying the democrat party but are weak  insecure people who can never destroy our great nation make america great again presidential harassment the washington post story about my speech in north carolina and tweet with its phony sources who do not exist is fake news the only thing people were talking about is the record setting crowd and the tremendous enthusiasm far greater than the democrats you'll see in 2020 big progress at the border but dems in congress must change the immigration laws for all to be good end the loopholes and much more the great state of west virginia is producing record setting numbers and doing really well when i became president it was practically shut down and closed for business not anymore i will help angel mom and great woman mary ann mendoza with twitter i know mary ann from the beginning and she should never be silenced she is a winner who has lost so much her child twitter if you're watching please do what you have to do now   economic numbers reach an all time high the best in our country's history great to be a part of something so good for so many our teams will be talking further and we agreed to speak again in the next 48 hours just had a very good call with  stefan löfven who assured me that american citizen a$ap rocky will be treated fairly likewise i assured him that a$ap was not a flight risk and offered to personally vouch for his bail or an alternative you can add 10percent or 15percent to this number economy doing better than ever before  thank you bill very nice  as you can see i did nothing to lead people on nor was i particularly happy with their chant just a very big and patriotic crowd they love the usa  rt  great news for texas in june's unemployment rates report  with the incompetent mayor of london you will never have safe streets  rt  how i wish we had such leadership in the uk don't like this country don't like what it gives you then leavetrump d rt  the  has made  a bold and binary decision are you going to choose socialists choose isis choose the just spoke to  about his friend a$ap rocky's incarceration i will be calling the very talented prime minister of sweden to see what we can do about helping a$ap rocky so many people would like to see this quickly resolved thank you   fed there is almost no inflation but it is no thanks to the federal reserve had they not acted so fast and so much we would be doing even better than we are doing right now this is our chance to build unparalleled wealth and success for the us growth which would greatly reduce percent debt don't blow it i like new york fed president john williams first statement much better than his second his first statement is 100percent correct in that the fed raised far too fast  too early also must stop with the crazy quantitative tightening we are in a world competition  winning big because of the faulty thought process we have going for us at the federal reserve we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically in other words our interest costs are much higher than other countries when they should be lower correct governor of the state did a good  job that may be true but she could not have done it without the tremendous economic success of our country  the turnaround that my administration has caused really nasty to me in his average iq columns kissed my a on the call phony he could not have been nicer or more respectful to your favorite president me then i saw the column he wrote trump will be re-elected won't he he called me a racist which i am not and said rhode island went from economically bad to great in 5 years because the thomas the chin friedman a weak and pathetic sort of guy writes columns for the new york times in between rounds of his favorite game golf two weeks ago while speaking to a friend on his cell phone i unfortunately ended up speaking to friedman we spoke for a while and state which i will win in  because they can't stand her and her hatred of our country and they appreciate all that i have done for them opening up mining and much more which has led to the best employment  economic year in minnesota's long and beautiful history mainstream media which has lost all credibility has either officially or unofficially become a part of the radical left democrat party it is a sick partnership so pathetic to watch they even covered a tiny staged crowd as they greeted foul mouthed omar in minnesota a it is amazing how the fake news media became crazed over the chant send her back by a packed arena a record crowd in the great state of north carolina but is

getting nothing done not on drug pricing not on immigration not on infrastructure not on nothing sooo much opportunity yet all they want to do is go fishing the american people are tired of the never ending witch hunt they want results now they are destroying the democrat party i'm appalled that so many of our presidential candidates are falling all over themselves to try to agree with the four horsewomen of the apocalypse i'm entitled to say that they're wack jobs  louisiana senator john kennedy opinion they're americans now i'm entitled to my opinion  i just think they're left wing cranks they're the reason there are directions on a shampoo bottle  we should ignore them the squad has moved the democrat party substantially left and in america if you hate our country you are free to leave the simple fact of the matter is the four congresswomen think that america is wicked in its origins they think that america is even more wicked now that we are all racist and evil they're entitled to their visible members of the house democrats who are now wedded to this bitterness and hate the republican vote was 187-4 wow also this was the first time since 1984 that the speaker of the house was ruled out of order and broke the rules of the house quite a day so great to see how unified the republican party was on today's vote concerning statements i made about four democrat congresswomen if you really want to see statements look at the horrible things they said about our country israel and much more they are now the top most yesterday it was my great honor to host our

things they have said omar is polling at 8percent cortez at 21percent nancy pelosi tried to push them away but now they are forever wedded to the democrat party see you in 2020 those tweets were not racist i don't have a racist bone in my body the so-called vote to be taken is a democrat con game republicans should not show weakness and fall into their trap this should be a vote on the filthy language statements and lies told by the democrat our country is free beautiful and very successful if you hate our country or if you are not happy here you can leave if you come after the president the country the flag he's going to defend himself what the squad doesn't like is that donald trump is enforcing the very laws that are on the books that were put there by congress jason chaffetz also buy jason's great new book power grab billionaire tech investor peter thiel believes google should be investigated for treason he accuses google of working with the chinese government   a great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone the trump administration will take a look shouting of the fword among many other terrible things and the petrified dems run for the hills why isn't the house voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said because they are the radical left and the democrats are afraid to take them on sad the democrat congresswomen have been spewing some of the most vile hateful and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the house or senate  yet they get a free pass and a big embrace from the democrat party horrible anti-israel anti-usa pro-terrorist  public the best economy in our lifetime  make america great again the obama administration built the cages not the trump administration democrats must give us the votes to change bad immigration laws the dems were trying to distance themselves from the four progressives but now they are forced to embrace them that means they are endorsing socialism hate of israel and the usa not good for the democrats detention facilities are not concentration camps america has never been stronger than it is now  rebuilt military highest stock market ever lowest unemployment and more people working than ever before keep america great they are anti-israel pro al-qaeda and comment on the 9/11 attack some people did something radical left democrats want open borders which means drugs crime human trafficking and much more we will never be a socialist or communist country if you are not happy here you can leave it is your choice and your choice alone this is about love for america certain people hate our country here we go with the fake polls just like what happened with the election against crooked hillary clinton abc nbc cnn   they all got it wrong on purpose suppression polls so early they will never learn to impeach president trump on day one make them the face of the future of the democrat party you will destroy the democrat party their policies will destroy our country    need i say more what does it mean for america to have free healthcare for illegal immigrants no criminalization of coming into our country see how that works for controlling immigration they talk about israel like they're a bunch of thugs not victims of the entire region they wanted they are anti-semitic they are anti-america we don't need to know anything about them personally talk about their policies i think they are american citizens who are duly elected that are running on an agenda that is disgusting that the american people will reject we all know that aoc and this crowd are a bunch of communists they hate israel they hate our own country they're calling the guards along our border the border patrol agents concentration camp guards they accuse people who support israel as doing it for the benjamin's if democrats want to unite around the foul language  racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular  unrepresentative congresswomen it will be interesting to see how it plays out i can tell you that they have made israel feel abandoned by the us when will the radical left congresswomen apologize to our country the people of israel and even to the office of the president for the foul language they have used and the terrible things they have said so many people are angry at them  their horrible  disgusting actions with the us and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place in the meantime we are receiving billions of dollars in tariffs from china with possibly much more to come these tariffs are paid for by china devaluing  pumping not by the us taxpayer china's 2nd quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than 27 years the united states tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave china for non-tariffed countries thousands of companies are leaving this is why china wants to make a deal we are doing great economically as a country number one despite the fed's antiquated policy on rates and tightening much room to grow and the many terrible things they say about the united states must not be allowed to go unchallenged if the democrat party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior then we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in 2020 so sad to see the democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our country and who in addition hate israel with a true and unbridled passion whenever confronted they call their adversaries including nancy pelosi racist their disgusting language think what it would be without the 3 year witch hunt and fake news media in partnership with the democrats  sorry can't let them into our country if too crowded tell them not to come to usa and tell the dems to fix the loopholes problem solved friday's tour showed vividly to politicians and the media how well run and clean the children's detention centers are great reviews failing  story was fake the adult single men areas were clean but crowded also loaded up with a big percentage of criminals rt   great video rt   at some point the light bulb comes on i hope there are more brandon's out there rt   frm zimbabwe i stand with pres trump so sick of cnn pundits haters thank you so nice but we are getting it done anyway  it is done these places need your help badly you can't leave fast enough i'm sure that nancy pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements and viciously telling the people of the united states the greatest and most powerful nation on earth how our government is to be run why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came then come back and show us how so interesting to see progressive democrat congresswomen who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe the worst most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world if they even have a functioning government at all now loudly a big risk of major flooding in large parts of louisiana and all across the gulf coast please be very careful 94percent approval rating in the republican party an all time high ronald reagan was 87percent thank you paul ryan almost killed the republican party weak ineffective  stupid are not exactly the qualities that republicans or the citizens of our country were looking for right now our spirit is at an all time high far better than the radical left dems you'll see next year house minority leader kevin mccarthy is a far superior leader than was lame duck speaker paul ryan tougher smarter and a far better fundraiser kevin is already closing in on 44 million dollars paul's final year numbers were according to breitbart abysmal people like this is one of the most horrible abuses of all those texts between gaga lovers would have told the whole story illegal deletion by mueller they gave us the insurance policy  andy mccabe is a major sleazebag among

great secretary of labor and his service is truly appreciated he will be replaced on an acting basis by pat pizzella the current deputy secretary alex acosta informed me this morning that he felt the constant drumbeat of press about a prosecution which took place under his watch more than 12 years ago was bad for the administration which he so strongly believes in and he graciously tendered his resignation wow  ratings have crashed lost all credibility great job by rush limbaugh on  if mexico produces which i think they will biggest part of deal with mexico has not yet been revealed china is similar except they devalue currency  subsidize companies to lessen effect of 25percent tariffs so far little effect to consumers companies will relocate to us companies to come to the usa and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we  stupidly lost 30percent of our auto business to mexico if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back and fast but very happy with the deal i made when you are the big piggy bank that other countries have been ripping off for years to a level that is not to be believed tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and  most importantly a powerful way to get  wins big no contest the great rush limbaugh will be on  at 8:30 am enjoy rt  amazing meeting guys up close and personal with the

booed him off the stage he promised me the wall  failed happening anyway paul ryan the failed vp candidate  former speaker of the house whose record of achievement was atrocious except during my first two years as president ultimately became a long running lame duck failure leaving his party in the lurch both as a fundraiser  leader do you believe this kind of bravery amazing drug seizure watch     each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our nation  you are challenging the media gatekeepers and the corporate censors to bring the facts straight to the american people together you reach more people than any television broadcast by far   and international we have only one real currency in the usa and it is stronger than ever both dependable and reliable it is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the world and it will always stay that way it is called the united states dollar similarly facebook libra's virtual currency will have little standing or dependability if facebook and other companies want to become a bank they must seek a new banking charter and become subject to all banking regulations just like other banks both national i am not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which are not money and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior including drug trade and other illegal activity to everyone on the gulf coast as you make preparations to protect your homes  loved ones from flooding  the coming storm it is imperative that you heed the directions of  state  local officials we are working closely w/ them please be prepared be careful  be safe today i am directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect the free speech rights of all americans we hope to see more transparency more accountability and more freedom   or a very nervous and skinny version of pocahontas 1/1024th as your president rather than what you have now so great looking and smart a true stable genius sorry to say that even social media would be driven out of business along with and finally the fake news media years or maybe 10 or 14 just kidding they will quickly go out of business for lack of credibility or approval from the public that's why they will all be endorsing me at some point one way or the other could you imagine having sleepy joe biden or alfred e newman the fake news is not as important or as powerful as social media they have lost tremendous credibility since that day in november 2016 that i came down the escalator with the person who was to become your future first lady when i ultimately leave office in six a big subject today at the white house social media summit will be the tremendous dishonesty bias discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies we will not let them get away with it much longer the fake news media will also be there but for a limited period so happy that i was able to keep sikorsky helicopter in the great state of pennsylvania keep america great dow just hit 27000 for first time ever it seems that the brits and the french and the germans are coming around to the idea that the iranians are up to no good   mexico is doing great at the border but china is letting us down in that they have not been buying the agricultural products from our great farmers that they said they would hopefully they will start soon will be a big and exciting day at the white house for social media conflicted and compromised mueller again he said he was done after his last 9 minute speech and that he had nothing more to say outside of the no collusion no obstruction report enough already go back to work i won unanimously the big emoluments case yesterday now the democrats have asked to see 12 more people who have already spent hours with robert mueller and spent a fortune on lawyers in so doing how many bites at the apple do they get before working on border loopholes and asylum they also want to interview the highly democrats had to quickly take down a tweet called kids in cages inhumane treatment at the border because the horrible picture used was from the obama years very embarrassing  and remember a bank that i did use years ago the now badly written about and maligned deutsche bank was then one of the largest and most prestigious banks in the world they wanted my business and so did many others the fake news media loves the narrative that i didn't use many banks because the banks didn't like me no i didn't use many banks because i didn't don't need their money old fashioned isn't it if i did it would have been very easy for me to get the number of people who are no longer looking for jobs but who are now seeing the opportunity for job growth you've got to give the president an a plus for that  thank you robert one of our great business leaders robert johnson bet i give the president a lot of credit for moving the economy in a positive direction that's benefiting a large number of americans i think the tax cuts clearly helped stimulate the economy overall if you look at the us economy and you look at months the lowest since 1972 the wall street journal editorial board a tale of two economies  nearly one million more blacks and two million more hispanics are employed than when barrack obama left office and minorities account for more than half of all new jobs created during the trump presidency unemployment among black women has hovered near 5percent for the last six the pledge of allegiance to our great country in st louis park minnesota is under siege that is why i am going to win the great state of minnesota in the 2020 election people are sick and tired of this stupidity and disloyalty to our wonderful usa or a very nervous and skinny version of pocahontas 1000/24th as your president rather than what you have now so great looking and smart a true stable genius sorry to say that even social media would be driven out of business along with and finally the fake news media years or maybe 10 or 14 just kidding they will quickly go out of business for lack of credibility or approval from the public that's why they

media will also be there but for a limited period the white house will be hosting a very big and very important social media summit today would i have become president without social media yes probably at its conclusion we will all go to the beautiful rose garden for a news conference on the census and citizenship rt  god-willing / jihadi-failing i am going to be alive to see trump in the white house boris in number 10netanyahu building thank you bill  thank you so much  thank you to lockheed martin one of the usa's truly great companies i was just informed by marillyn hewson ceo of

endorsement today on this usmca day of action thousands of grassroots supporters are urging congress to pass the great bipartisan usmca usmca = more jobs for american workers more economic growth and more opportunity for our farmers ranchers and businesses   thank you robert johnson  my administration is taking groundbreaking action to bring new hope to millions of americans suffering from kidney disease today i signed an executive order advancing american kidney health serving and doing a great job as your president including accepting zero salary word just out that i won a big part of the deep state and democrat induced witch hunt unanimous decision in my favor from the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit on the ridiculous emoluments case i don't make money but lose a fortune for the honor of iran has long been secretly enriching in total violation of the terrible 150 billion dollar deal made by john kerry and the obama administration remember that deal was to expire in a short number of years sanctions will soon be increased substantially the dems witch hunt continues  done a great job of reducing crime in the african american community because more african americans are at work today trump is not a racist he's a businessman because he's a great businessman he's pushing for lives to be better michael brown ceo hydromatic tech our company has grown since trump has taken control of the white house  the presidency in the sense that we have better opportunities now to do what we've been wanting to do for quite some time and that is to create manufacturing jobs i believe that president trump has fbi's christopher steele fake story falls apart false intel  media contacts were flagged before fisa john solomon the hill  the reality is that this was a plot from the very beginning to frame trump   so now the obama appointed judge on the census case are you a citizen of the united states won't let the justice department use the lawyers  that it wants to use could this be a first more and more the radical left is using commerce to hurt their enemy they put out the name of a store brand or company and ask their so-called followers not to do business there they don't care who gets hurt but also don't understand that two can play that game to your favorite president me these people are vicious and totally crazed but remember there are far more great people deplorables in this country than bad do to them what they do to you fight for bernie marcus and home depot a truly great patriotic  charitable man bernie marcus the co-founder of home depot who at the age of 90 is coming under attack by the radical left democrats with one of their often used weapons they don't want people to shop at those great stores because he contributed why would kentucky ever think of giving up the most powerful position in congress the senate majority leader for a freshman senator with little power in what will hopefully be the minority party we need mitch in the senate to keep america great democrats are coming after our great kentucky senator mitch mcconnell with someone who compared my election to september 11th after a wonderful dinner at the  last night with the amir of qatar  it was my great honor to welcome him to the  this afternoon  healthcare obamacare to stay in place when it would have been replaced by something far better shows how incredibly important our upcoming 2020 election is i have long heard that the appointment of supreme court justices is a president's most important decision so true recent strained decisions by the united states supreme court some so simple as allowing the question are you a citizen of the united states on our very expensive census report or the even more strained decisions 2 allowing the world's most expensive  pathetic india has long had a field day putting tariffs on american products no longer acceptable food stamp participation hits 10 year low wow  with president trump at the helm not only is america getting great again but he's going to make our estuaries our rivers our water everything better the things he is doing and done are just helping america tremendously thank you to bruce hrobak  outrage is growing in the great state of minnesota where our patriots are now having to fight for the right to say the pledge of allegiance i will be fighting with you  i agree with the president the supreme court got it wrong there should be a question about citizenship on the census ag barr sees a pathway to add the citizenship question  steve doocy   working hard on something that should be so easy people are fed up and they are both only getting bigger better and strongerthank you mr president handled i told  how to do that deal but she went her own foolish way-was unable to get it done a disaster i don't know the ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool tell him the usa now has the best economy  military  anywhere in the world by far the wacky ambassador that the uk foisted upon the united states is not someone we are thrilled with a very stupid guy he should speak to his country and prime minister may about their failed brexit negotiation and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was very good numbers on the economy much potential for growth trade deals being negotiated or being set up for negotiation we have been treated very unfairly to put it mildly by other countries for many years but that is changing spoke to  kevin mccarthy about the earthquakes in california and informed him that we will be working very closely on emergency funding also spoke to governor  all working together thought of within the us we will no longer deal with him the good news for the wonderful united kingdom is that they will soon have a new prime minister while i thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent state visit last month it was the queen who i was most impressed with i have been very critical about the way the uk and prime minister theresa may handled brexit what a mess she and her representatives have created i told her how it should be done but she decided to go another way i do not know the ambassador but he is not liked or well brilliant constitutional lawyer dr john eastman said the special prosecutor mueller should have never been appointed in the first place the entire exercise was fundamentally illegal the witch hunt should never happen to another president of the us again a total scam  thank you ari  a massive crowd that fake news  some dems didn't want to report  cute  their lowest rated show watch the  weekend daytime anchors who are terrible go after her big time that's what they want but it sure is not what the audience wants impossible to believe that  has hired  the person fired by  after they tried to hide the bad facts  failed for giving crooked hillary clinton the questions to a debate something unimaginable now she is all over fox including shep smith by far a source of information ask the times what they paid for the boston globe  what they sold it for lost 15 billion dollars or their old headquarters building disaster or their unfunded liability  is changing fast but they forgot the people who got them there comcast nbc/msnbc trump haters who do whatever brian  steve tell them to do like cnn nbc is also way down in the ratings but  who failed in getting the very boring dem debates is now loading up with democrats  even using fake unsourced  as watching  weekend anchors is worse than watching low ratings fake news  or lyin' brian williams remember when he totally fabricated a war story trying to make himself into a hero  got fired a very dishonest journalist and the crew of degenerate we are building the wall now but the reason the badly needed wall wasn't approved in the republican controlled house and senate was that we had a very slim majority in the senate  needed 9 democrat votes they were totally unwilling to give wall votes to us want open borders brought up not them because the dems won't change the loopholes and asylum big media con job united states citizens first border patrol and others in law enforcement have been doing a great job we said there was a crisis the fake news  the dems said it was manufactured now all agree we were right but they always knew that they are crowded which we the fake news media in particular the failing  is writing phony and exaggerated accounts of the border detention centers first of all people should not be entering our country illegally only for us to then have to care for them we should be allowed to focus on  congratulations to the us women's soccer team on winning the world cup great and exciting play america is proud of you all last year was the first in 51 years where prescription drug prices actually went down but things have been and are being put in place that will drive them down substantially if dems would work with us in a bipartisan fashion we would get big results very fast sleepy joe biden just admitted he worked with segregationists and separately has already been very plain about the fact that he will be substantially raising everyone's taxes if he becomes president ridiculously all democrats want to substantially raise taxes joe biden is a reclamation project some things are just not salvageable china and other countries that ripped us off for years are begging for him he deserted our military our law enforcement and our healthcare added more debt than all other presidents combined won't win a wonderful man and great republican  great coach great guy  jerry will be getting the presidential medal of freedom well deserved  democrats must change the loophole  asylum laws but they probably won't they want open borders which means massive crime and drugs  our country is the envy of the world thank you mr president  as well as we are doing from the day after the great election when the market shot right up it could have been even better massive additional wealth would have been created  used very well our most difficult problem is not our competitors it is the federal reserve strong jobs report low inflation and other countries around the world doing anything possible to take advantage of the united states knowing that our federal reserve doesn't have a clue they raised rates too soon too often  tightened while others did just the opposite my deepest sympathies go out to the family and friends of great businessman and energy expert chris cline his wonderful daughter kameron and their friends on the tragic accident which took place in the bahamas the great people of west virginia will never forget them happy birthday to our great united states   record 157005000 employed 19th record of trump era  jobs jobs jobs

or expenses charged and has been being sued by cuomo and new york state for years another part of the political witch hunt just in case anyone is interested clinton foundation never even looked at new york businesses in search of anything at all they can find to make me look as bad as possible so on top of ridiculously high taxes my children and companies are spending a fortune on lawyers no wonder people and businesses are fleeing new york in record numbers more money than it had going on for years originally brought by crooked hillary's campaign chair ag eric schneiderman until forced to resign for abuse against women they never even looked at the disgusting clinton foundation now cuomo's ag is harassing all of my it is very hard and expensive to live in new york governor andrew cuomo uses his attorney general as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes they sue on everything always in search of a crime i even got sued on a foundation which took zero rent  expenses  gave away why president trump has to deal with north korea the way it is now he had to figure out what to do with the korea mess i think this is why the president deserves a lot of credit harry kazianis center for the national interest thank you in my opinion the president has done more good on the korean issue in the last year and a half than president obama did in eight years if you look at the strides they made during the obama years which advocated strategic patience-they stuck their head in the sand this is congratulations to prime minister abe of japan for hosting such a fantastic and well run g-20 there wasn't a thing that was missing or a mistake that was made perfect the people of japan must be very proud of their prime minister thank you to president moon of south korea for hosting the american delegation and me immediately following the very successful g-20 in japan while there it was great to call on chairman kim of north korea to have our very well covered meeting good things can happen for all congratulations to legislators in new jersey for not passing taxes that would have driven large numbers of high end taxpayers out of the state many were planning to leave  will now be staying new york  others should start changing their thought process on taxes fast stocks cap best first half since 1997  our country is doing great stocks cap best first half since 1997   our country is doing great stock had the best first half since 1997   our country is doing great the talk of the world so many amazing things happened over the last three days all or at least most of those things are great for the united states much was accomplished leaving south korea after a wonderful meeting with chairman kim jong un stood on the soil of north korea an important statement for all and a great honor the leaders of virtually every country that i met at the g-20 congratulated me on our great economy many countries are having difficulties on that score we have the best economy anywhere in the world with great  unlimited potential looking into the future the highly respected farm journal has just announced my approval rating with our great farmers at 74percent and that despite all of the fake  corrupt news that they are forced to endure farmers have been unfairly treated for many years and that is turning around fast i am in south korea now president moon and i have toasted our new trade deal a far better one for us than that which it replaced today i will visit with and speak to our troops and also go to the the dmz long planned my meeting with president moon went very well again with china as our relationship with them continues to be a very good one the quality of the transaction is far more important to me than speed i am in no hurry but things look very good there will be no reduction in the tariffs currently being charged to china amounts of agricultural product from our great farmers at the request of our high tech companies and president xi i agreed to allow chinese company huawei to buy product from them which will not impact our  national security importantly we have opened up negotiations i had a great meeting with president xi of china yesterday far better than expected i agreed not to increase the already existing tariffs that we charge china while we continue to negotiate china has agreed that during the negotiation they will begin purchasing large thank you   i am in south korea now president moon and i have toasted our new trade deal a far better one for us than that which it replaced today i will visit with and speak to our troops and also go the the dmz long planned my meeting with president moon went very well again with china as our relationship with them continues to be a very good one the quality of the transaction is far more

south korea with president moon while there if chairman kim of north korea sees this i would meet him at the border/dmz just to shake his hand and say hello 54percent in poll i would be at 75percent with our great economy maybe the best ever if not for the phony witch hunt and the fake news media i am in japan at the g-20 representing our country well but i heard it was not a good day for sleepy joe or crazy bernie one is exhausted the other is nuts so what's the big deal the stock market went up massively from the day after i won the election all the way up to the day that i took office because of the enthusiasm for the fact that i was going to be president that big stock market increase must be credited to me if hillary won a big crash all democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare how about taking care of american citizens first that's the end of that race great to be back in japan for the  bipartisan humanitarian aid bill for the southern border just passed a great job done by all now we must work to get rid of the loopholes and fix asylum thank you also to mexico for the work being done on helping with illegal immigration a very big difference united states supreme court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter can anyone really believe that as a great country we are not able the ask whether or not someone is a citizen only in america seems totally ridiculous that our government and indeed country cannot ask a basic question of citizenship in a very expensive detailed and important census in this case for 2020 i have asked the lawyers if they can delay the census no matter how long until the thank you   thank you  real professionals    i look forward to speaking with prime minister modi about the fact that india for years having put very high tariffs against the united states just recently increased the tariffs even further this is unacceptable and the tariffs must be withdrawn just stopped in alaska and said hello to our great troops   and  should be ashamed of themselves for having such a horrible technical breakdown in the middle of the debate truly unprofessional and only worthy of a fake news organization which they are boring these flyers depict australia's policy on illegal immigration much can be learned   what now for those who denied a 'crisis' at the border  they came to me asking for help and i got criminal justice reform passed with help from both republicans and democrats many said that nobody but president trump could have done this all previous administrations failed please ask why they failed to the candidates ever since the passage of the super predator crime bill pushed hard by  together with bill and crooked hillary clinton which inflicted great pain on many but especially the african american community democrats have tried and failed to pass criminal justice reform for tonight's  be sure to follow      and  for rapid response fact checking and the truth   sorry i'm on air force one off to save the free world and all of the others who have leaked lied and did so many other terrible things how is it even possible that these people are not being brought forward because it is a rigged democrat con game and the fake and corrupt media loves every minute of it why aren't the democrats in the house calling comey brennan clapper page and her fbi lover whose invaluable phone records were illegally deleted crooked hillary podesta ohr and nellie the gps fusion characters christopher steele the dnc  their missing server the republican senate just passed bipartisan humanitarian assistance for our southern border 84-8 in addition to aid congress must close the catastrophic loopholes that are driving the crisis we must end incentives for smuggling children trafficking women and selling drugs no collusion no obstruction robert mueller said he was done after his last 9 minute news conference as later corrected now the dems want to  give it another try does it ever end according to fake news and low ratings  democrats say hearings could change impeachment debate that's because they have lost the impeachment debate 80percent say no and they are hoping that yet another do over after 2 1/2 years and $40000000 will turn things around i have been in office for many years the military is very important to me and at no time in my professional life has the us military been as strong as it is right now thank you  the democrats would save many lives if they would change our broken and very dangerous immigration laws it can be done instantly just departed for the  summit in osaka japan🇺🇸🇯🇵  the democrats should change the loopholes and asylum laws so lives will be saved at our southern border they said it was not a crisis at the border that it was all just manufactured now they admit that i was right but they must do something about it fix the

all the way iran's very ignorant and insulting statement put out today only shows that they do not understand reality any attack by iran on anything american will be met with great and overwhelming force in some areas overwhelming will mean obliteration no more john kerry  obama the wonderful iranian people are suffering and for no reason at all their leadership spends all of its money on terror and little on anything else the us has not forgotten iran's use of ied's  efp's bombs which killed 2000 americans and wounded many more iran leadership doesn't understand the words nice or compassion they never have sadly the thing they do understand is strength and power and the usa is by far the most powerful military force in the world with 15 trillion dollars invested over the last two years alone stock market is heading for one of the best months june in the history of our country thank you mr president rt  who thinks the debates just won't be the same without donna brazile working on them behind the scenes i am pleased to announce the launch of  this new platform will allow my campaign and other republicans to compete with the democrats money machine this has been a priority of mine and i'm pleased to share that it is up and running  think of what it could have been if the fed had gotten it right thousands of points higher on the dow and gdp in the 4's or even 5's now they stick like a stubborn child when we need rates cuts  easing to make up for what other countries are doing against us blew it despite a federal reserve that doesn't know what it is doing raised rates far too fast very low inflation other parts of world slowing lowering  easing  did large scale tightening $50 billion/month we are on course to have one of the best months of june in us history think of what it could have been if the fed had gotten it right thousands of points higher on the dow and gdp in the 4's or even 5's now they stick like a stubborn child when we need rates cuts  easing to make up for what other countries are doing against us blew it despite a federal reserve that doesn't know what it is doing raised rates far to fast very low inflation other parts of world slowing lowering  easing  did large scale tightening $50 billion/month we are on course to have one of the best months of june in us history a dangerous journey we don't even need to be there in that the us has just become by far the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world the us request for iran is very simple no nuclear weapons and no further sponsoring of terror china gets 91percent of its oil from the straight japan 62percent  many other countries likewise so why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries many years for zero compensation all of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been when our country had no debt and built everything from highways to the military with cash we had a big system of tariffs now we allow other countries to steal our wealth treasure and jobs but no more the usa is doing great with unlimited upside into the future wonderful church service at camp david thank you i want to give the democrats every last chance to quickly negotiate simple changes to asylum and loopholes this will fix the southern border together with the help that mexico is now giving us probably won't happen but worth a try two weeks and big deportation begins i never called the strike against iran back as people are incorrectly reporting i just stopped it from going forward at this time at the request of democrats i have delayed the illegal immigration removal process deportation for two weeks to see if the democrats and republicans can get together and work out a solution to the asylum and loophole problems at the southern border if not deportations start sanctions come off iran and they become a productive and prosperous nation again the sooner the better iran cannot have nuclear weapons under the terrible obama plan they would have been on their way to nuclear in a short number of years and existing verification is not acceptable we are putting major additional sanctions on iran on monday i look forward to the day that i am at camp david working on many things including iran we have a great economy tariffs have been very helpful both with respect to the huge dollars coming in  on helping to make good trade deals the dow heading to best june in 80 years stock market best june in 50 years thank you jessica  a great book  looking good we must win to keep america great  stock market is on track to have the best june in over 50 years thank you mr president  when people come into our country illegally they will be deported the people that ice will apprehend have already been ordered to be deported this means that they have run from the law and run from the courts these are people that are supposed to go back to their home country they broke the law by coming into the country  now by staying stock market is on track to have the best june in over 50 years thank you mr president  proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone i am in no hurry our military is rebuilt new  and ready to go by far the best in the world sanctions are biting  more added last night iran can never have nuclear weapons not against the usa and not against the world on monday they shot down an unmanned drone flying in international waters we were cocked  loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when i asked how many will die 150 people sir was the answer from a general 10 minutes before the strike i stopped it not death to america i terminated deal which was not even ratified by congress and imposed strong sanctions they are a much weakened nation today than at the beginning of my presidency when they were causing major problems throughout the middle east now they are bust president obama made a desperate and terrible deal with iran gave them 150 billion dollars plus i8 billion dollars in cash iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out gave them a free path to nuclear weapons and soon instead of saying thank you iran yelled this russia collusion hoax was perpetrated in part by people inside the government and in part by a compliant fake news media mollie hemingway     the facts are starting to pour out stay tuned just revealed that the failing and desperate new york times was feeding false stories about me  those associated with me to the fbi this shows the kind of unprecedented hatred i have been putting up with for years with this crooked newspaper is what they have done legal sp closes at record high  it was my great honor to host canadian prime minister  at the  today🇺🇸🇨🇦  iran made a very big mistake the president has a really good story to tell we have unemployment lower than we've seen in decades we have people who stopped looking for work coming back into the labor force we are in a record growth period michael steel  do you believe sp opens at record high since election day 2016 stocks up almost 50percent stocks gained 92 trillion dollars in value and more than 5000000 new jobs added to the economy  if our opponent had won there would have been a market crash plain and simple    congratulations to president lopez obrador  mexico voted to ratify the usmca today by a huge margin time for congress to do the same here just returning from orlando and doral miami florida and heading to the oval office where i will present the great economist dr arthur laffer with the presidential medal of freedom i will be interviewed live tonight by  on   9 pm enjoy asking hillary clinton why she deleted and acid washed her emails after getting a subpoena from congress anybody else would be in jail for that yet the dems refuse to even bring it up rigged house committee so sad that the democrats are putting wonderful hope hicks through hell for 3 years now after total exoneration by robert mueller  the mueller report they were unhappy with result so they want a do over very unfair  costly to her will it ever end why aren't they if i didn't have the phony witch hunt going on for 3 years and if the fake news media and their partner in crime the democrats would have played it straight i would be way up in the polls right now with our economy winning by 20 points but i'm winning anyway democrat congressional hearings are  33000 emails that hillary and her lawyer deleted and acid washed after getting a subpoena from congress that is real obstruction that the dems want no part of because their hearings are rigged and a disgrace to our country the dems are very unhappy with the mueller report so after almost 3 years they want a redo or do over this is extreme presidential harassment they gave crooked hillary's people complete immunity yet now they bring back hope hicks why aren't the dems looking at the thank you 🇺🇸  don't ever forget this election is about you it is about your family your future  the fate of your country we begin our campaign with the best record the best results the best agenda  the only positive vision for our country's future   in the ultimate act of moral cowardice not one democrat candidate for president not a single one has stood up to defend the incredible men and women of ice and border patrol they don't have the character the virtue or the spine   on no issue are democrats more extreme  and more depraved  than when it comes to border security the democrat agenda of open borders is morally reprehensible it is the great betrayal of the american middle class and our country as a whole   together we are breaking the most sacred rule in washington politics we are keeping our promises to the american people because my only special interest is you   thank you orlando florida join me live tonight in orlando florida at 8:00 pm eastern as we kickoff  enjoy departing for orlando florida with  melania  i thank pat for his outstanding service and will be naming secretary of the army mark esper to be the new acting secretary of defense i know mark and have no doubt he will do a fantastic job acting secretary of defense patrick shanahan who has done a wonderful job has decided not to go forward with his confirmation process so that he can devote more time to his family german dax way up due to stimulus remarks from mario draghi very unfair to the united states ecb officials see rate cut as primary tool for any new stimulus   had a very good telephone conversation with president xi of china we will be having an extended meeting next week at the g-20 in japan our respective teams will begin talks prior to our meeting the fake news doesn't report it but republican enthusiasm is at an all time   high look what is going on in orlando florida right now people have never seen anything like it unless you play a guitar going to be wild see you later european markets rose on comments unfair to us made today by mario d mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others only a few people showed up for the so-called impeachment rallies over the weekend the numbers were anemic no spirit no hope more importantly no collusion no obstruction wow  the state department said it has identified 30 security incidents involving current or former employees and their handling of crooked hillary clinton's emails   this is really big never admitted before highly classified material will the dems investigate this the story in the  about the us escalating attacks on russia's power grid is fake news and the failing new york times knows it they should immediately release their sources which if they exist at all which i doubt are phony times must be held fully accountable thousands of people are already lined up in orlando some two days before tomorrow nights big rally large screens and food trucks will be there for those that can't get into the 25000 capacity arena it will be a very exciting evening make america great again long before they get to our southern border guatemala is getting ready to sign a safe-third agreement the only ones who won't do anything are the democrats in congress they must vote to get rid of the loopholes and fix asylum if so border crisis will end quickly next week ice will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the united states they will be removed as fast as they come in mexico using their strong immigration laws is doing a very good job of stopping people  polls are always bad for me they were against crooked hillary also something weird going on at fox our polls show us leading in all 17 swing states for the record i didn't spend 30 hours with  but rather a tiny fraction of that more fake news   one size doesn't fit all i support west virginia schools keep up the great work  big jim justice  i am with you  iran to defy uranium stockpile limits only fake polls show us behind the motley crew we are looking really good but it is far too early to be focused on that much work to do make america great again big rally tomorrow night in orlando florida looks to be setting records we are building large movie screens outside to take care of everybody over 100000 requests our country is doing great far beyond what the haters  losers thought possible and it will only get better thank you mr prime minister a great honor  congratulations to gary woodland in winning the united states open golf championship fantastic playing great heart there will be more in gary's future rep alexandria ocasio-cortez i think we have a very real risk of losing the presidency to donald trump i agree and that is the only reason they play the impeach card which cannot be legally used almost 70percent in new poll say don't impeach so ridiculous to even be talking about this subject when all of the crimes were committed by the other side they can't win the election fairly if republicans ever did that to the democrats there would be all hell to pay it would be a scandal like no other when will the fake news media start asking democrats if they are ok with the hiring of christopher steele a foreign agent paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc to dig up dirt and write a phony dossier against the presidential candidate of the opposing party thank you pm  and the state of israel for this great honor🇺🇸🇮🇱  happy father's day to all including my worst and most vicious critics of which there are fewer and fewer this is a fantastic time to be an american keep america great news is that at the end of 6 years after america has been made great again and i leave the beautiful white house do you think the people would demand that i stay longer keep america great both of these horrible papers will quickly go out of business  be forever gone a poll should be done on which is the more dishonest and deceitful newspaper the failing new york times or the amazon lobbyist washington post they are both a disgrace to our country the enemy of the people but i just can't seem to figure out which is worse the good the first 2 1/2 years of his presidency including the fact that we have one of the best economies in the history of our country it is called earned media in any event enjoy the show misleading in that i personally spent only a small fraction of that time doing interviews i do have a few other things to do you know think i will do many more network interviews as i did in 2016 in order to get the word out that no president has done what i have in i enjoyed my interview with  on  so funny to watch the fake news media try to dissect  distort every word in as negative a way as possible it will be aired on sunday night at 8:00 pm and is called president trump 30 hours which is somewhat saying enough democrat voters want to hear the politicians talking about issues this is a huge distraction and will only help donald trump get elected   greatest president since ronald reagan said a counter-protester lehighvalleylive yesterday was the radical left democrats big impeachment day they worked so hard to make it something really big and special but had one problem almost nobody showed up the media admits low turnout for anti-trump rallies   all around the country people are congratulations to great guy pete hegseth and wonderful jenny cunningham on their engagement they will have a fantastic life together  so nice  more and more states want to do this but their governors and leaders don't have the courage to do so the politics will soon mandate however because people from california  all over the land are demanding that sanctuary cities be gone no illegals drugs or trafficking florida governor ron desantis just signed bill banning sanctuary cities in state  forcing all law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration authorities bill prohibits local gov't from enacting sanctuary policies that protect undocumented immigrants also not true anything goes with our corrupt news media today they will do or say whatever it takes with not even the slightest thought of consequence these are true cowards and without doubt the enemy of the people do you

their race for the presidency this is the biggest  worst political scandal in the history of the united states of america sad which he is a member when  took calls from another person also very successfully purporting to be a russian operative did he call the fbi or even think to call the fbi no the fact is that the phony witch hunt is a giant scam where democrats when senator  spoke at length and in great detail about extremely negative information on me with a talented entertainer purporting to be a russian operative did he immediately call the fbi no in fact he didn't even tell the senate intelligence committee of call the fbi about these calls and meetings how ridiculous i would never be trusted again with that being said my full answer is rarely played by the fake news media they purposely leave out the part that matters i meet and talk to foreign governments every day i just met with the queen of england uk the prince of wales the pm of the united kingdom the pm of ireland the president of france and the president of poland we talked about everything should i immediately call the fbi about these calls and meetings how ridiculous i would never be trusted again

england uk the prince of whales the pm of the united kingdom the pm of ireland the president of france and the president of poland we talked about everything should i immediately the dems fight us at every turn in the meantime they are accomplishing nothing for the people they have gone absolutely loco or unhinged as they like to say is not constitutionally permissable alan dershowitz constitutional lawyer congress cannot impeach president trump did nothing wrong because if they did they would be putting themselves above the law the constitution provides criteria for impeachment treason bribery high crimes   misdemeanors unless there is compelling evidence impeachment can to embarrass the trump administration and republicans attack the trump administration this is campaigning by the dems attorney david bruno so true in the meantime they are getting no work done on drug pricing infrastructure  many other things much tougher game than the republicans did when they had the house majority republicans will remember this has already been argued before the us supreme court but the house doesn't want to wait this is a common thread between all of the committees do whatever

thank you to all of our nation's farmers may god bless you and may god bless america  trump administration gives final approval for year-round e15 use  today here in iowa we honor america's cherished farming heritage we salute your commitment to american energy independence  and we celebrate the bright future we are forging together powered by clean affordable american ethanol  on my way to iowa just heard nearly 1000 agriculture groups signed a letter urging congress to approve the usmca our patriot farmers  rural america have spoken now congress must do its job  support these great men and women by passing the bipartisan usmca trade agreement why did the democrats run if they didn't want to do things  good day in the stock market people have no idea the tremendous potential our country has for growth and many other things if mexico produces which i think they will biggest part of deal with mexico has not yet been revealed china is similar except they devalue currency and subsidize companies to lessen effect of 25percent tariff so far little effect to consumer companies will relocate to us companies to come to the usa and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30percent of our auto business to mexico if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back and pass but very happy with the deal i made maria dagan steve stuart v when you are the big piggy bank that other countries have been ripping off for years to a level that is not to be believed tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producers and  most importantly a powerful way to get this is because the euro and other currencies are devalued against the dollar putting the us at a big disadvantage the fed interest rate way too high added to ridiculous quantitative tightening they don't have a clue  the united states has very low inflation a beautiful thing this is because the euro and other currencies are devalued against the dollar putting the us at a big disadvantage the fed interest rate way to high added to ridiculous quantitative tightening they don't have a clue  rt  european landmarks have a question they desperately need answering how do you stop the tourists from coming  sad when you think about it but mexico right now is doing more for the united states at the border than the democrats in congress  presidential harassment investigation in the senate they can talk to john dean until the cows come home we're not doing anything in the senate regarding the mueller report we are going to harden our infrastructure against 2020  mueller has spoken he found no collusion between the trump campaign and the russians the bottom line is what the democrat house is doing is trying to destroy the trump presidency which has been a tremendous success and i can assure you that we're done with the mueller jerry nadler's trump bashing show is a bust headline new york post   the greatest witch hunt of all time continues all crimes were by the other side but the committee refuses to even take a look deleting 33000 emails is the real obstruction and much more new book just out the real deal my decade fighting battles and winning wars with trump is really wonderful it is written by two people who are very smart  know me well george sorial  damian bates as opposed to all the books where the author has no clue who i am enjoy  🇺🇸  despite the phony witch hunt we will continue to make america great again thank you  congratulations to the 2019 indianapolis 500 winner   and  🏆🏁  i have been briefed on the helicopter crash in new york city phenomenal job by our great first responders who are currently on the scene thank you for all you do 24/7/365 the trump administration stands ready should you need anything at all can't believe they are bringing in john dean the disgraced nixon white house counsel who is a paid cnn contributor no collusion no obstruction democrats just want a do-over which they'll never get thank you  and john eastman  when will the failing new york times admit that their front page story on the  the new mexico deal at the border is a fraud and nothing more than a badly reported hit job on me something that has been going on since the first day i announced for the presidency sick journalism we do not anticipate a problem with the vote but if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming tariffs will be reinstated we have fully signed and documented another very important part of the immigration and security deal with mexico one that the us has been asking about getting for many years it will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by mexico's legislative body now with our new deal mexico is doing more for the usa on illegal immigration than the democrats in fact the democrats are doing nothing they want open borderswhich means illigal immigration drugs and crime the failing  story on mexico and illegal immigration through our southern border has now been proven shockingly false and untrue bad reporting and the paper is embarrassed by it the only problem is that they knew it was fake news before it went out corrupt media no obstruction the dems were devastated after all this time and money spent $40000000 the mueller report was a disaster for them but they want a redo or do over they are even bringing in  sleazebag attorney john dean sorry no do overs go back to work for two years all the democrats talked about was the mueller report because they knew that it was loaded up with 13 angry democrat trump haters later increased to 18 but despite the bias when the report came out the findings were no collusion and facts that led to if president obama made the deals that i have made both at the border and for the economy the corrupt media would be hailing them as incredible  a national holiday would be immediately declared with me despite our record setting economy and all that i have done no credit twitter should let the banned conservative voices back onto their platform without restriction it's called freedom of speech remember you are making a giant mistake there is not we can always go back to our previous very profitable position of tariffs but i don't believe that will be necessary the failing   ratings challenged  will do anything possible to see our country fail they are truly the enemy of the people not mentioned in yesterday press release one in particular were agreed upon that will be announced at the appropriate time there is now going to be great cooperation between mexico  the usa something that didn't exist for decades however if for some unknown reason mexico was not being cooperative on the border in things we had or didn't have and now i have full confidence especially after speaking to their president yesterday that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done importantly some things another false report in the failing   we have been trying to get some of these border actions for a long time as have other administrations but were not able to get them or get them in full until our signed agreement with mexico additionally and for many years rt  next we get to watch the democrat civil war between the socialists and the establishment during the debates in a race to s rt  trump wins historic landslide electiondemocrats russia

illegal aliens ever 1036 people who illegally crossed the border in el paso around 4am democrats need to stand by our incredible border patrol and finally fix the loopholes at our border  just arrived

years i told him no the next day he was named special counsel a total conflict of interest nice comey and brennan are turning on each other   congressman john ratcliffe the trump campaign clearly did not conspire or collude  say he fought back against this phony crime that didn't exist this horrendous false accusation and he shouldn't fight back he should just sit back and take it could this be obstruction no mueller didn't find obstruction either presidential harassment russia russia russia that's all you heard at the beginning of this witch hunt hoaxand now russia has disappeared because i had nothing to do with russia helping me to get elected it was a crime that didn't exist so now the dems and their partner the fake news media say he fought back against this phony crime that didn't exist this horrendous false acquisition and he shouldn't fight back he should just sit back and take it could this be obstruction no mueller didn't find obstruction either presidential harassment russia russia russia that's all you heard at the beginning of this witch hunt hoaxand now russia has disappeared because i had nothing to do with russia helping me to get elected it was a crime that

inspiring portrait of the old guard great job  i don't know why the radical left democrats want bob mueller to testify when he just issued a 40 million dollar report that states loud  clear  for all to hear no collusion and no obstruction how do you obstruct a no crime dems are just looking for trouble and a do-over if they try to impeach president trump who has done nothing wrong no collusion they will end up getting him re-elected  impeachment is for high crimes and misdemeanors there were no high crimes and misdemeanors except for those committed by the other side i am on air force one with the first lady heading to japan and looking forward to honoring on behalf of the united states his majesty the emperor of japan i will also be discussing trade and military with my friend prime minister  intelligence agencies were used against an american president      this should never happen to a president again dems are furious at robert mueller for his findings no collusion no obstruction now they should go back to work and legislate when is twitter going to allow the very popular conservative voices that it has so viciously shut down back into the open it is time wow cnn ratings are way down record lows people are getting tired of so many fake stories and anti-trump lies chris cuomo was rewarded for lowest morning ratings with a prime time spot which is failing badly and not helping the dumbest man on television don lemon 71percent of voters rate the economy as excellent or good the highest number in more than 18 years  pelosi stammers through news conference  nancy pelosi should not be out there doing the kinds of things she is doing she will diminish herself and her membership she cannot put a subject with a predicate in the same sentence what's going on  ed rollins     today's action will help ensure that all americans learn the truth about the events that occurred and the actions that were taken during the last presidential election and will restore confidence in our public institutions  during the 2016 presidential election the attorney general has also been delegated full and complete authority to declassify information pertaining to this investigation in accordance with the long-established standards for handling classified information today at the request and recommendation of the attorney general of the united states president donald j trump directed the intelligence community to quickly and fully cooperate with the attorney general's investigation into surveillance activities  poll a majority of americans want the democrats to stop investigating president trump the mueller report said very strongly no collusion which led to no obstruction the dems can't get over 2016 or the conclusive mueller findings they are now the do nothing party the us senate has just approved a 19 billion dollar disaster relief bill with my total approval great we will never forget our fallen heroes it was our great honor to be with you today   congratulations to prime minister  and his bjp party on their big election victory great things are in store for the us-india partnership with the return of pm modi at the helm i look forward to continuing our important work together  and  are monitoring the damaging storms and flooding in oklahoma listen to the warnings of your local officials and stay safe we are with you our hearts go out to the people of missouri as they woke up to assess the damage from storms you are strong and resilient and we are here to assist  when the democrats in congress refinish for the 5th time their fake work on their very disappointing mueller report finding they will have the time to get the real work of the people done move quickly i was extremely calm yesterday with my meeting with pelosi and schumer knowing that they would say i was raging which they always do along with their partner the fake news media well so many stories about the meeting use the rage narrative anyway fake  corrupt press rex tillerson a man who is dumb as a rock and totally ill prepared and ill equipped to be secretary of state made up a story he got fired that i was out-prepared by vladimir putin at a meeting in hamburg germany i don't think putin would agree look how the us is doing the democrats have become known as the do nothing party drug prices pre-existing conditions and our great vets all they are geared up to do six committees is squander time day after day trying to find anything which will be bad for me a pure fishing expedition like this never happened before  it should never happen again the democrats are getting nothing done in congress all of their effort is about a re-do of the mueller report which didn't turn out the way they wanted it is not possible for them to investigate and legislate at the same time their heart is not into infrastructure lower democrats don't want to fix the loopholes at the border they don't want to do anything open borders and crime zero is getting done with the democrats in charge of the house all they want to do is put the mueller report behind them and start all over again no do-overs in a letter to her house colleagues nancy pelosi said president trump had a temper tantrum for us all to see this is not true i was purposely very polite and calm much as i was minutes later with the press in the rose garden can be easily proven it is all such a lie i want to welcome you all to the  as we award our very bravest law enforcement officers and firefighters our nation's highest public safety award  the medal of valor democrat leadership is tearing the united states apart but i will continue to set records for the american people  and nancy thank you so much for your prayers i know you truly mean it in the meantime my administration is achieving things that have never been done before including unleashing perhaps the greatest economy in our country's history but they really want a do-over you can't investigate and legislate simultaneously it just doesn't work that way you can't go down two tracks at the same time let chuck nancy jerry adam and all of the rest finish playing their games so sad that nancy pelosi and chuck schumer will never be able to see or understand the great promise of our country they can continue the witch hunt which has already cost $40m and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in america or get back to work as i have long been saying and has now been proven out this is a witch hunt against the republican party and myself and it was the other side that caused the problem not us between russia and the trump campaign mr mcgahn can be forgiven for declining the honor of appearing in mr nadler's pseudo-impeachment drama wall street journal editorial boardtoday may 21 2019 he jerry nadler wants a show he wants to use mr mcgahn as a prop to spend three hours claiming that mr trump tried to obstruct the mueller investigation yet mr mueller wasn't obstructed in any way his copious report was released for all to see  there was no collusion the democrats are in danger of becoming irrelevant because of their decision to keep taking the country on wild goose chases they ought to start governing you know for a change  michael goodwin  everybody including me thought that when the 40 million dollar mueller report was released with no collusion and no obstruction of a crime caused by others that was the end but no the democrats want to keep it going in an effort to help them in 2020 bad for the country also tremendous work is being done on pure renovation fixing existing walls that are in bad condition and ineffective and bringing them to a very high standard much of the wall being built at the southern border is a complete demolition and rebuilding of old and worthless barriers with a brand new wall and footings problem is the haters say that is not a new wall but rather a renovation wrong and we must build where most needed without the illegal witch hunt my poll numbers especially because of our historically great economy would be at 65percent too bad the greatest hoax in american history presidential harassment the democrats are getting zero work done in congress all they are focused on is trying to prove the mueller report wrong the witch hunt after two years of an expensive and comprehensive witch hunt the democrats don't like the result and they want a do over in other words the witch hunt continues everything the democrats are asking me for is based on an illegally started investigation that failed for them especially when the mueller report came back with a no collusion finding now they say impeach president trump even though he did nothin wrong while they fish congratulations to governor  on winning the republican primary for governor tonight in the great state of kentucky matt you are doing a fantastic job great news for republicans fred keller has just won the hard fought for pennsylvania congressional contest in a landslide over 70percent of the vote thanks to the thousands who showed up for the rally last night congratulations to fred and his wonderful family john brennan on the mueller probe i don't know if i received bad information but i think i suspected that there was more than there actually was wow he admits he was wrong congress should go back to work on drug prices etc the democrats are on a fishing expedition wanting to interview the same people and see the same things as we just went through for two years with robert mueller and the 18 angry dems never happened to a president before never even happened to president obama after spending 40 million dollars reviewing 14 million pages of documents  interviewing 500 people with the total support of the white house the mueller report was a big disappointment to the democrats so they want a do over it doesn't work that way-so bad for our country shahira knight has done a wonderful job as my legislative affairs director at the white house she was outstanding for us and for our country will be a tremendous success in the private sector wow mark levin's new book opened at  it is great  keep it there for a long time  johnny we will miss you  you did a great job  at a conclusion of no collusion and no obstruction the dems were unhappy with the outcome of the $40m mueller report so now they want a do-over so even though i didn't have to do it with presidential privilege i allowed everyone to testify including white house counsel don mcgahn for over 30 hours to robert mueller and the 18 angry trump-hating democrats and they arrived i am pleased to announce my nomination of barbara barrett of arizona and former chairman of the aerospace corporation to be the next secretary of the air force she will be an outstanding secretary  pennsylvania don't forget to get out and vote today for republican fred keller for congress fred is strong on crime second amendment military vets and

the meantime their economy continues to collapse very sad for the iranian people the fake news put out a typically false statement without any knowledge that the united states was trying to set up a negotiation with iran this is a false report on this cuban independence day we stand by the people of cuba in their quest for freedom democracy and prosperity the cuban regime must end its repression of cubans  venezuelans the united states will not stand idly by as cuba continues to subvert democracy in the americas looks like bernie sanders is history sleepy joe biden is pulling ahead and think about it i'm only here because of sleepy joe and the man who took him off the 1percent trash heap president o china wants sleepy joe badly why are the democrats not looking into all of the crimes committed by crooked hillary and the phony russia investigation they would get back their credibility jerry nadler schiff  would have a whole new future open to them perhaps they could even run for president we have a booming economy and working people are making gains that they haven't seen in decades  stuart varney  two tweets missing from last batch probably a twitter error no time for a redo only the dems get redos was very good and highly professional to deal with and if for any reason i didn't like them i would have gone elsewherethere was always plenty of money around and banks to choose from they would be very happy to take my money fake news now the new big story is that trump made a lot of money and buys everything for cash he doesn't need banks but where did he get all of that cash could it be russia no i built a great business and don't need banks but if i did they would be thereand deutschebank the mainstream media has never been as corrupt and deranged as it is today fake news is actually the biggest story of all and is the true enemy of the people that's why they refuse to cover the real russia hoax but the american people are wise to what is going on fashioned but true when you don't need or want money you don't need or want banks banks have always been available to me they want to make money fake media only says this to disparage and always uses unnamed sources because their sources don't even exist the failing new york times it will pass away when i leave office in 6 years and others of the fake news media keep writing phony stories about how i didn't use many banks because they didn't want to do business with me wrong it is because i didn't need money very old the mainstream media hates to cover this  starting monday our great farmers

political shows this morning and continue to be amazed at how every question is asked in the most negative way the mainstream media should be ashamed of itself but the good news is that the usa is wise to your game of dishonesty and deception he would see that it was nevertheless strong on no collusion and ultimately no obstructionanyway how do you obstruct when there is no crime and in fact the crimes were committed by the other side justin is a loser who sadly plays right into our opponents hands never a fan of  a total lightweight who opposes me and some of our great republican ideas and policies just for the sake of getting his name out there through controversy if he actually read the biased mueller report composed by 18 angry dems who hated trump conditions drug prices down for first time in 51 years  soon will drop much further right to try protecting your 2nd amendment big tax  reg cuts 32 gdp strong foreign policy  much much more that nobody else would have been able to

up news out there iran can have no idea what is actually going on it now seems the general flynn was under investigation long before was common knowledge it would have been impossible for me to know this but if that was the case and with me being one of two people who would become president why was i not told so that i could make a change the fake news media is hurting our country with its fraudulent and highly inaccurate coverage of iran it is scattershot poorly sourced made up and dangerous at least iran doesn't know what to think which at this point may very well be a good thing will jerry nadler ever look into the fact that crooked hillary deleted and acid washed 33000 emails after getting a most powerful demand notice for them from congress my campaign for president was conclusively spied on nothing like this has ever happened in american politics a really bad situation treason means long jail sentences and this was treason new fox poll 58percent of people say that the fbi broke the law in investigating donald j trump  make america great again drain the swamp what happened is that donald trump won down goes comey  will the democrats give our country a badly needed immigration win before the election good chance all people that are illegally coming into the united states now will be removed from our country at a later date as we build up our removal forces and as the laws are changed please do not make yourselves too comfortable you will be leaving soon border patrol is apprehending record numbers of people at the southern border the bad hombres of which there are many are being detained  will be sent home those which we release under the ridiculous catch  telease loophole are being registered and will be removed later the democrats now

one-year anniversary of the opening of the united states embassy in jerusalem israel our beautiful embassy stands as a proud reminder of our strong relationship with israel and of the importance of keeping a promise and standing for the truth when prime minister  of japan visited with me in the  two weeks ago i told him that i would be going to the g20 in osaka japan i look forward to being with him and other world leaders our great senator and star from the state of arkansas  has just completed a wonderful book sacred duty about arlington national cemetery and the men and women who serve with such love and devotion on sale today make it big china will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates as always in order to make up for the business they are and will be losing if the federal reserve ever did a match it would be game over we win in any event china wants a deal our great senator and star from the state of arkansas  has just completed a wonderful book sacred duty about arlington national cemetary and the men and women who serve with such love and devotion on sale today make it big this money will come from the massive tariffs being paid to the united states for allowing china and others to do business with us the farmers have been forgotten for many years their time is now our great patriot farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now hopefully china will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product the best but if not your country will be making up the difference based on a very high china buy of the tremendous ground we have lost to china on trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the wto it will all happen and much faster than people think when the time is right we will make a deal with china my respect and friendship with president xi is unlimited but as i have told him many times before this must be a great deal for the united states or it just doesn't make any sense we have to be allowed to make up some billions of dollars and moving jobs back to the usa where they belong other countries are already negotiating with us because they don't want this to happen to them they must be a part of usa action this should have been done by our leaders many years ago enjoy we can make a deal with china tomorrow before their companies start leaving so as not to lose usa business but the last time we were close they wanted to renegotiate the deal no way we are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made will be taking in so that they will be more competitive for usa buyers we are now a much bigger economy than china and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 election we are the piggy bank that everyone

has taken so advantage of the us for so many years that they are way ahead our presidents did not do the job therefore china should not retaliate-will only get worse completely avoided if you buy from a non-tariffed country or you buy the product inside the usa the best idea that's zero tariffs many tariffed companies will be leaving china for vietnam and other such countries in asia that's why china wants to make a deal so badly there is no reason for the us consumer to pay the tariffs which take effect on china today this has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the us 21 points by china because china subsidizes product to such a large degree also the tariffs can be democrat rep tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the holocaust she obviously has tremendous hatred of israel and the jewish people can you imagine what would happen if i ever said what she said and says bernie sanders the economy is doing well and i'm sure i don't have to give trump any credit i'm sure he'll take all the credit that he wants wrong bernie the economy is doing great and would have crashed if my opponent and yours crooked hillary clinton had ever won has anyone noticed that all the boston  have done is win since coming to the white house others also have done very well the white house visit is becoming the opposite of being on the cover of sports illustrated by the way the boston players were great guys the unexpectedly good first quarter 32percent gdp was greatly helped by tariffs from china some people just don't get it also congratulations to  on the great job you are doing and the big ratings jump thank you president trump thank you  great show this morning and congratulations on your number one by far rating well deserved i say openly to president xi  all of my many friends in china that china will be hurt very badly if you don't make a deal because companies will be forced to leave china for other countries too expensive to buy in china you had a great deal almost completed  you backed out there will be nobody left in china to do business with very bad for china very good for usa but china has taken so advantage of the us for so many years that they are way ahead our presidents did not do the job therefore china should not retaliate-will only get worse completely avoided if you by from a non-tariffed country or you buy the product inside the usa the best idea that's zero tariffs many tariffed companies will be leaving china for vietnam and other such countries in asia that's why china wants to make a deal so badly their is no reason for the us consumer to pay the tariffs which take effect on china today this has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the us 21 points by china because china subsidizes product to such a large degree also the tariffs can be information as long as president trump is president his opposition will use every tool and misuse every tool available to make his life miserable     sadly this proves i am doing a great job also best economy and employment numbers ever it's the attack strategy of harass this is not about the attorney general who is very sophisticated  knows it isn't about him it's about trying to destroy president trump through an assault on his ag for upholding the rule of law he released a massive amount of overthrow the president through an illegal coup recommended by previous doj   and the democrat national committee-the democrat party apparatus-has been caught using donor dollars to collude with russian intelligence to attack a domestic political opponent me the fbi has no leadership the director is protecting the same gangthat tried to just another abuse of power in a long series of abuses of power by the democrats that began during the obama administration continued through the mueller fbi operation  now the baton has been passed to jerry nadler to continue to abuse power to harass president trump even director james clapper admits that the fbi actions against the trump presidential campaign do in fact meet the definition of spying perhaps fbi director christopher wray will be the next to do so  china is dreaming that sleepy joe biden or any of the others gets elected in 2020 they love ripping off america the constitutional crisis is the democrats refusing to work let them start by fixing the mess that their immigration laws have caused at the southern border when the mueller report came out showing no collusion with russia of course it was supposed to be over back to work for the people but the dems have gone nuts and it has actually gotten worse hope the republicans win back the house in 2020 or little will get done ever since the mueller report showed no collusion  no obstruction the dems have been working overtime to damage me and the republican party by issuing over 80 demands for documents and testimonies and with no reason that's all they want to do don't care about anything else despite two years and millions of dollars spent the democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the mueller report were made public but they knew there was nothing even before the report was started it is all a big hoax the biggest in american history employment numbers ever low taxes  regulations a rebuilt military  va many great new judges  so much more but we have had a giant scam perpetrated upon our nation a witch hunt a treasonous hoax that is the constitutional crisis  hopefully guilty people will pay the democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a constitutional crisis they and their partner the fake news media are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible they are a sad joke we may have the strongest economy in our history best we will then spend match or better the money that china may no longer be spending with our great patriot farmers agriculture which is a small percentage of total tariffs received and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world great  we are right where we want to be with china remember they broke the deal with us  tried to renegotiate we will be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from china buyers of product can make it themselves in the usa ideal or buy it from non-tariffed countries really sad  big attacks on republicans and conservatives by social media not good hoax my campaign was being seriously spied upon by intel agencies and the democrats this never happened before in american history and it all turned out to be a total scam a witch hunt that yielded no collusion no obstruction this must never be allowed to happen again think of it i became president of the united states in one of the most hard fought and consequential elections in the history of our great nation from long before i ever took office i was under a sick  unlawful investigation concerning what has become known as the russian president who is willing to have the battle and we have a great attorney general who is willing to lead the battle and they are going to get to the bottom of it    the democrats have nothing just want to distract from this president the fbi was not doing its job the state department was covering things up everyday for hillary at the end of the day they're fearful of what they did and should be fearful this is a tough rt   discusses what she wrote about in her column today re how very powerful people in dc are panicking because ag i was not going to fire bob mueller and did not fire bob mueller in fact he was allowed to finish his report with unprecedented help from the trump administration actually lawyer don mcgahn had a much better chance of being fired than mueller never a big fan the only problem is that they know i am going to win best economy  employment numbers in us history  much more and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term would be wise for them to act now but love collecting big tariffs i think that china felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election 2020 to see if they could get lucky  have a democrat win in which case they would continue to rip-off the usa for $500 billion a year so now the radical left dems don't talk about collusion anymore because the mueller report said there was no collusion they only want to talk about obstruction even though there was no obstruction or no crime except for the crimes committed by the other side i won the 2016 election partially based on no tax returns while i am under audit which i still am and the voters didn't care now the radical left democrats want to again relitigate this matter make it a part of the 2020 election such an easy way to avoid tariffs make or produce your goods and products in the good old usa it's very simple rt  trump economy vs obama

weaker just sit back and watch in the meantime china should not renegotiate deals with the us at the last minute this is not the obama administration or the administration of sleepy joe who let china

obstruction of justice is what the democrats are trying to do to this attorney general congressman jim jordan r-ohio  guess what that's not going to happen china has just informed us that they vice-premier are now coming to the us to make a deal we'll see but i am very happy with over $100 billion a year in tariffs filling us coffersgreat for us not good for china the reason for the china pullback  attempted renegotiation of the trade deal is the sincere hope that they will be able to negotiate with joe biden or one of the very weak democrats and thereby continue to ripoff the united states $500 billion a year for years to come you would get it by building or even buying you always wanted to show losses for tax purposesalmost all real estate developers did and often re-negotiate with banks it was sport additionally the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate fake news hit job real estate developers in the 1980's  1990's more than 30 years ago were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would if one was actively building show losses and tax losses in almost all cases much was non monetary sometimes considered tax shelter  case closed

disaster relief 91 billion dollars than any state in the history of the us as an example florida got $12 billion  texas $39 billion for their monster hurricanes now the democrats are saying no relief to scott walker is 100percent correct when he says that the republicans must wake up to the democrats state by state power grab they play very dirty actually like never before don't allow them to get away with what they are doing the united states has been losing for many years 600 to 800 billion dollars a year on trade with china we lose 500 billion dollars sorry we're not going to be doing that anymore also there are no high crimes  misdemeanors no collusion no conspiracy no obstruction all the crimes are on the other side and that's what the dems should be looking at but they won't nevertheless the tables are turning democrat texas congressman al green says impeachment is the only thing that can prevent president trump from re-election in 2020   in other words dems can't win the election fairly you can't impeach a president for creating the best economy in our country's history the witch hunt is over but we will never forget make america great again despite the tremendous success that i have had as president including perhaps the greatest economy and most successful first two years of any president in history they have stolen two years of my our presidency collusion delusion that we will never be able to get back to the gazan people  these terrorist acts against israel will bring you nothing but more misery end the violence and work towards peace it can happen once again israel faces a barrage of deadly rocket attacks by terrorist groups hamas and islamic jihad we support israel 100percent in its defense of its citizens pending the confirmation of mark morgan as our nation's new ice director matt albence will serve in the role of acting director matt is tough and dedicated and has my full support to deploy ice to the maximum extent of the law  this is not congressional oversight this is bullying jason riley the wall street journal the report sounded an awful lot as being comeyesque in other words i'm not going to charge this person there wasn't even close to being a crime but i'm going to criticize him on the way out the door that's unfortunate because it's stepping outside of the role robert ray to testify are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong no collusion conclusion there was no crime except on the other side incredibly not covered in the report and no obstruction bob mueller should not testify no redos for the dems after spending more than $35000000 over a two year period interviewing 500 people using 18 trump hating angry democrats  49 fbi agents all culminating in a more than 400 page report showing no collusion why would the democrats in congress now need robert mueller of additional goods sent to us by china remain untaxed but will be shortly at a rate of 25percent the tariffs paid to the usa have had little impact on product cost mostly borne by china the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate no for 10 months china has been paying tariffs to the usa of 25percent on 50 billion dollars of high tech and 10percent on 200 billion dollars of other goods these payments are partially responsible for our great economic results the 10percent will go up to 25percent on friday 325 billions dollars the kentucky derby decision was not a good one it was a rough  tumble race on a wet and sloppy track actually a beautiful thing to watch only in these

immigration policy that mark morgan will be joining the trump administration as the head of our hard working men and women of ice mark is a true believer and american patriot he will do a great job the witch hunt is over but we will never forget make america great again despite the tremendous success that i have had as president including perhaps the greatest economy and most successful first two years of any president in history they have stollen two years of my our presidency collusion delusion that we will never be able to get back mike has been a fantastic senator  the kentuky derby decision was not a good one it was a rough and tumble race on a wet and sloppy track actually a beautiful thing to watch only in these days of political correctness could such an overturn occur the

great country has spent an astounding 7 trillion dollars in the middle east over the last 19 years but i am looking hard at a bipartisan plan of 1 to 2 trillion dollars badly needed rt    they wanted

nasty you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick  demented ideas but if you make it i will see you at the starting gate despite the fact that the mueller report was composed by trump haters and angry democrats who had unlimited funds and human resources the end result was no collusion no obstruction amazing mueller was not fired and was respectfully allowed to finish his work on what i and many others say was an illegal investigation there was no crime headed by a trump hater who was highly conflicted and a group of 18 very angry democrats drain the swamp as has been incorrectly reported by the fake news media i never told then white house counsel don mcgahn to fire robert mueller even though i had the legal right to do so if i wanted to fire mueller i didn't need mcgahn to do it i could have done it myself nevertheless the great state of tennessee is so close to passing school choice all of our nation's children regardless of background deserve a shot at achieving the american dream time to get this done so important  of the great state of utah has written a wonderful new book entitled our lost declaration highly recommended as one united nation we

country for the 2019 prescription drug abuse and heroin summit  in atlanta georgia  rep alexandria ocasio-cortez is correct the va is not broken it is doing great but that is only because of the trump administration we got veterans choice  accountability passed president trump deserves a lot of credit dan caldwell concerned veterans of america i didn't call bob costa of the washington post he called me returned his call  just more fake news congress has no time to legislate they only want to continue the witch hunt which i have already won they should start looking at the criminals who are already very well known to all this was a rigged system we will drain the swamp no collusion no obstruction there has never been a president who has been more transparent millions of pages of documents were given to the mueller angry dems plus i allowed everyone to testify including wh counsel i didn't have to do this but now they want more can anyone comprehend what a great job border patrol and law enforcement is doing on our southern border so far this year they have apprehended 418000 plus illegal immigrants way up from last year mexico is doing very little for us dems in congress must act now are there no high crimes and misdemeanors there are no crimes by me at all all of the crimes were committed by crooked hillary the dems the dnc and dirty cops and we caught them in the act we waited for mueller and won so now the dems look to congress as last hope the mueller report despite being written by angry democrats and trump haters and with unlimited money behind it $35000000 didn't lay a glove on me i did nothing wrong if the partisan dems ever tried to impeach i would first head to the us supreme court not only mexico's soldiers recently pulled guns on our national guard soldiers probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the border better not happen again we are now sending armed soldiers to the border mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending  returning a very big caravan of over 20000 people started up through mexico it has been reduced in size by mexico but is still coming mexico must apprehend the remainder or we will be forced to close that section of the border  call up the military the coyotes  cartels have weapons the american people deserve to know who is in this country yesterday the supreme court took up the census citizenship question a really big deal make america great again former cia analyst larry johnson accuses united kingdom intelligence of helping obama administration spy on the 2016 trump presidential campaign  wow it is now just a question of time before the truth comes out and when it does it will be a beauty rep occasio-cortez is correct the va is not broken it is doing great but that is only because of the trump administration we got veterans choice  accountability passed president trump deserves a lot of credit dan caldwell concerned veterans of america thanks rush   you mean the stock market hit an all-time record high today and they're actually talking impeachment will i ever be given credit for anything by the fake news media or radical liberal dems no collusion great meeting this afternoon at the  with  from  lots of subjects discussed regarding their platform and the world of social media in general look forward to keeping an open dialogue  i will be in green bay wisconsin this saturday april 27th at the resch center  7:00pm cdt big crowd expected   great golf champion  friend ernie els  has done a tremendous job in assisting those w/ autism through his els for autism fdn focusing on education research global outreach recreation services therapy services  adult services  great interview by jared nice to have extraordinarily smart people serving our country  keep america great the wall is being rapidly built the economy is great our country is respected again but should be much higher than that if twitter wasn't playing their political games no wonder congress wants to get involved and they should must be more and fairer companies to get out the word the best thing ever to happen to twitter is donald trump   so true but they don't treat me well as a republican very discriminatory hard for people to sign on constantly taking people off list big complaints from many people different names-over 100 m harley davidson has struggled with tariffs with the eu currently paying 31percent they've had to move production overseas to try and offset some of that tariff that they've been hit with which will rise to 66percent in june of 2021  so unfair to us we will reciprocate dumb and sick a really bad show with low ratings and will only get worse cnn has been a proven and long term ratings and beyond disaster in fact it rewarded chris cuomo with a now unsuccessful prime time slot despite his massive failure in the morning only on cnn sorry to say but  is by far the best of the morning political shows on television it rightfully has by far the highest  ratings not even close morning psycho joe who helped get me elected in 2016 by having me on free all the time has nosedived too angry in the old days if you were president and you had a good economy you were basically immune from criticism remember it's the economy stupid today i have as president perhaps the greatest economy in historyand to the mainstream media it means nothing but it will the radical left democrats together with their leaders in the fake news media have gone totally insane i guess that means that the republican agenda is working stay tuned for more i will be going to green bay wisconsin for a really big rally on saturday evening big crowd expected much to talk about make america great again i wonder if the new york times will apologize to me a second time as they did after the 2016 election but this one will have to be a far bigger   better apology on this one they will have to get down on their knees  beg for forgiveness-they are truly the enemy of the people paul krugman of the fake news new york times has lost all credibility as has the times itself with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me he is obsessed with hatred just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is he said market would crash only record highs presidential harassment  this should never happen to another president again  just spoke to  will be doing a very interesting show tonight at 7:00 pm eastern on  today  melania and i are honored to host the 2019  easter egg roll  isn't it amazing that the people who were closest to me by far and knew the campaign better than anyone were never even called to testify before mueller the reason is that the 18 angry democrats knew they would all say ‘no collusion' and only very good things a very exculpatory section of the mueller report no conspiracy coordination or collusion with the trump campaign and the russians you can't be more clear than that   the obama administration did not do itself proud in this   southern border crisis   spoke to the prime minister of italy giuseppe conte mostly concerning immigration taxes trade and the economy of both of our countries very good call spoke to prime minister ranil wickremesinghe of sri lanka this morning to inform him that the united states stands by him and his country in the fight against terrorism also expressed condolences on behalf of myself and the people of the united states my friend herman cain a truly wonderful man has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the federal reserve board i will respect his wishes herman is a great american who truly loves our country congratulations  thank you    only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment there were no crimes by me no collusion no obstruction so you can't impeach it was the democrats that committed the crimes not your republican president tables are finally turning on the witch hunt saudi arabia and others in opec will more than make up the oil flow difference in our now full sanctions on iranian oil iran is being given very bad advice by  and people who helped him lead the us into the very bad iran nuclear deal big violation of logan act so true thanks    spoke to president maithripala sirisena of sri lanka yesterday to inform him that the united states stands by him and his country in the fight against terrorism also expressed condolences on behalf of myself and the people of the united states how do you impeach a republican president for a crime that was committed by the democrats make america great again can you believe that i had to go through the worst and most corrupt political witch hunt in the history of the united states no collusion when it was the other side that illegally created the diversionary  criminal event and even spied on my campaign disgraceful jobless claims in the united states have reached their lowest best level in over 50 years despite no collusion no obstruction the radical left democrats do not want to go on to legislate for the good of the people but only to investigate and waste time this is costing our country greatly and will cost the dems big time in 2020 the trump haters and angry democrats who wrote the mueller report were devastated by the no collusion finding nothing but a total hit job which should never have been allowed to start in the first place do you believe this the new york times op-ed media and democrats owe trump an apology well they got that one right 138 people have been killed in sri lanka with more that 600 badly injured in a terrorist attack on churches and hotels the united states offers heartfelt condolences to the great people of sri lanka we stand ready to help happy easter i have never been happier or more content because your country is doing so well with an economy that is the talk of the world and may be stronger than it has ever been before have a great day heartfelt condolences from the people of the united states to the people of sri lanka on the horrible terrorist attacks on churches and hotels that have killed at least 138 million people and badly injured 600 more we stand ready to help rt  prior reporting confirmed that some fbi agents were fed up with comey  thank you  and   good night of television 8:00 pm   9:00 pm  with interview of  followed by greg g honest commentary is always nice check out  life liberty  levin on  now 7pm if  spent the same energy fighting barack obama as he does fighting donald trump he could have won the race maybe  the end result of the greatest witch hunt in us political history is no collusion with russia and no obstruction pretty amazing united states weekly jobless claims just hit a 50 year low the economy is doing great the fake news media is doing everything possible to stir up and anger the pols and as many people as possible seldom mentioning the fact that the mueller report had as its principle conclusion the fact that there was no collusion with russia the russia hoax is dead despite the fact that the mueller report should not have been authorized in the first place  was written as nastily as possible by 13 18 angry democrats who were true trump haters including highly conflicted bob mueller himself the end result is no collusion no obstruction wishing a happy passover to all those celebrating in america israel and around the world  trump has been totally vindicated  time for democrats to accept reality  the washington post and new york times are in my opinion two of the most dishonest media outlets around truly the enemy of the people  big fat waste of time energy and money $30000000 to be exact it is now finally time to turn the tables and bring justice to some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes perhaps even spying or treason this should never happen again agreed to testify it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the report about me some of which are total bullshit  only given to make the other person look good or me to look bad this was an illegally started hoax that never should have happened a statements are made about me by certain people in the crazy mueller report in itself written by 18 angry democrat trump haters which are fabricated  totally untrue watch out for people that take so-called notes when the notes never existed until needed because i never rt  mueller's final report ‘completely vindicates' president trump 👇  kimberley strassel should get the pulitzer she is a treasure and i don't know her who correctly called the russia hoax right from the start others who were soooo wrong will get the prize fake news  the mueller report is perhaps the single most humiliating thing that has ever happened to the white house press in the history of this country they know they liedmany reporters lied about russia collusion and so much more clapper  brennan all lies  if dozens of federal prosecutors spent two years trying to charge you with a crime and found they couldn't it would mean there wasn't any evidence you did it and that's what happened here that's what we just learned from the mueller report   when there is not an underlying crime with regard to collusion in fact the whole thing was a made up fraud it is difficult to say that someone is obstructing something there was no underlying crime    anything the russians did concerning the 2016 election was done while obama was president he was told about it and did nothing most importantly the vote was not affected donald trump was being framed he fought back that is not obstruction   i had the right to end the whole witch hunt if i wanted i could have fired everyone including mueller if i wanted i chose not to i had the right to use executive privilege i didn't today i was thrilled to host the  soldier ride once again at the  we were all deeply honored to be in the presence of true american heroes as i have been saying all along no collusion no obstruction  no collusion no obstruction  attorney

get worse big sections of wall now being built wow fbi made 11 payments to fake dossier's discredited author trump hater christopher steele     the witch hunt has been a total fraud on your president

sanders vs sleepy joe biden as the two finalists to run against maybe the best economy in the history of our country and many other great things i look forward to facing whoever it may be may god rest their soul bernie sanders and wife should pay the pre-trump taxes on their almost $600000 in income he is always complaining about these big tax cuts except when it benefits him they made a fortune off of trump but so did everyone else and that's a good thing not a bad thing many trump fans  signs were outside of the  studio last night in the now thriving thank you president trump bethlehem

column today dirty dealings of dirt devils who concocted trump-russia probe the greatest scam in political history if the mainstream media were honest which they are not this story would be bigger and more important than watergate someday god bless the people of france the forgotten voters of the 2016 election are now doing great the steel industry is rebuilding and expanding at a pace that it hasn't seen in decades our country has one of the best economies in many years perhaps ever unemployment numbers best in 51 years wow so horrible to watch the massive fire at notre dame cathedral in

success  comeback in sports golf and more importantly life i will be presenting him with the presidential medal of freedom heading to the great state of minnesota since there was no collusion why was there an investigation in the first place answer dirty cops dems and crooked hillary the mueller report which was written by 18 angry democrats who also happen to be trump haters and clinton supporters should have focused on the people who spied on my 2016 campaign and others who fabricated the whole russia hoax that is never forget the crime those illegal immigrants who can no longer be legally held congress must fix the laws and loopholes will be subject to homeland security given to sanctuary cities and states mark morgan president obama's border patrol chief gave the following message to me president trump stay the course i agree and believe it or not we are making great progress with a system that has been broken for many years i finally agree with   the radical left democrats will never be satisfied with anything we give them they will always resist and obstruct they spied on my campaign we will never forget before nancy who has lost all control of congress and is getting nothing done decides to defend her leader rep omar she should look at the anti-semitic anti-israel and ungrateful us hate statements omar has made she is out of control except for her control of nancy congress should come back to dc now and fix the immigration laws mueller and the ag based on mueller findings and great intelligence have already ruled no collusion no obstruction these were crimes committed by crooked hillary the dnc dirty cops and others investigate the investigators what do i know about branding maybe nothing but i did become president but if i were boeing i would fix the boeing 737 max add some additional great features  rebrand the plane with a new nameno product has suffered like this one but again what the hell do i know chinese telecom giant huawei hires former obama cyber security official as a lobbyist this is not good or acceptable     this is president trump trying to deliver on his promises while the bureaucratic machine fights his agenda he needs populist allies these changes are not chaos but rather progress all this is president trump at his absolute best thank you steve such a puff piece on nancy pelosi by  yet her leadership has passed no meaningful legislation all they do is investigate as it turns out crimes that they instigated  committed the mueller no collusion decision wasn't even discussed-and she was a disaster at wh love people who are great under pressure what a fantastic life comeback for a really great guy  congratulations to  a truly great champion watching final hole of   is looking great great masters going on right now  is leading with 2 holes left to play very exciting tune in if the fed had done its job properly which it has not the stock market would have been up 5000 to 10000 additional points and gdp would have been well  over 4percent instead of 3percentwith almost no inflation quantitative tightening was a killer should have done the exact opposite just out the usa has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to sanctuary cities we hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level especially by the state of california which is well known or its poor management  high taxes democrats must change the immigration laws fast if not sanctuary cities must immediately act to take care of the illegal immigrants and this includes gang members drug dealers human traffickers and criminals of all shapes sizes and kinds change the laws now so interesting to see the mayor of oakland and other sanctuary cities not want our currently detained immigrants after release due to the ridiculous court ordered 20 day rule if they don't want to serve our nation by taking care of them why should other cities  towns i never offered pardons to homeland security officials never ordered anyone to close our southern border although i have the absolute right to do so and may if mexico does not apprehend the illegals coming to our border and am not frustrated it is all fake  corrupt news when i won the election in 2016 the  had to beg their fleeing subscribers for forgiveness in that they covered the election and me so badly they didn't have a clue it was pathetic they even apologized to me but now they are even worse really corrupt reporting the new york times sanctuary cities/immigration story today was knowingly wrong on almost every fact they never call to check for truth their sources often don't even exist a fraud they will lie  cheat anyway possible to make me look bad in 6 years they will be gone great playing by  at the  tomorrow will be a big and exciting day for golf and for sports many fantastic players in the hunt ratings gold good luck to all why should radical left democrats in congress have a right to retry and examine the $35000000 two years in the making no collusion mueller report when the crime committed was by crooked hillary the dnc and dirty cops attorney general barr will make the decision extraordinary growth economic success and riches under the leadership of chairman kim i look forward to the day which could be soon when nuclear weapons and sanctions can be removed and then watching north korea become one of the most successful nations of the world i agree with kim jong un of north korea that our personal relationship remains very good perhaps the term excellent would be even more accurate and that a third summit would be good in that we fully understand where we each stand north korea has tremendous potential for rt  we will never forget  in new york state democrats blocked a bill expanding college tuition for gold star families after approving aid for illegal immigrants no wonder so many people are leaving ny very sad another fake story on  that i offered pardons to homeland securiy personnel in case they broke the law regarding illegal immigration and sanctuary cities of course this is not true mainstream media is corrupt and getting worse if that is possible every day a fake story by politico made up sources thank you mount vernon  finally great news at the border  finally great news at the border  thank you jeh so well stated  if the radical left democrats all of a sudden don't want the illegal migrants in their sanctuary cities no more open arms why should others be expected to take them into their communities go home and come into our country legally and through a system of merit wsj's strassel barr 'right' to say 'spying' occurred on trump campaign | breitbart  via  we will never forget  the radical left always seems to have an open borders open arms policy  so this should make them very happy due to the fact that democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws we are indeed as reported giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only even the democrats now say that our southern border is a crisis and a national emergency hopefully we will not be getting any more bad outrageous court decisions democrats don't like the results of the mueller report so now they're trying everything else    they should stop wasting time and money and get back to real legislating especially on the border president obama's top white house lawyer gregory b craig was indicted yesterday on very serious charges this is a really big story but the fake news new york times didn't even put it on page one rather page 16  not much better tiny page one corrupt news i don't need to know any more we're done absolutely done he mueller tried the case there's no collusion     no matter what we do or give to the radical left it will never be enough great heroes  jobless claims at 50 year low and the radical dems reeling in disarray as the president continues to win win and win again the left is pretending to be shocked by ag william barr's testimony before congress in which he said spying did occur on the trump 2016 campaign    house democrats want to negotiate a $2 trillion spending increase but can't even pass their own plan we can't afford it anyway and it's not happening beautiful afternoon in the oval office today with a few great american heroes  biggest scandal of our time the coup that failed   spy games time for answers  rt  wow  got a well deserved ass kicking shame on you ted   great news   too bad that the european union is being so tough on the united kingdom and brexit the eu is likewise a brutal trading partner with the united states which will change sometimes in life you have to let people breathe before it all comes back to bite you i think what the democrats are doing with the border is treasonous their open border mindset is putting our country at risk will not let this happen congratulations to  and  on the great news so proud thank you texas i love you  join me in crosby texas as i deliver remarks and sign executive orders on energy and infrastructure  so it has now been determined by 18 people that truly hate president trump that there was no collusion with russia in fact it was an illegal investigation that should never have been allowed to start i fought back hard against this phony  treasonous hoax spoke to bibi  to congratulate him on a great and hard-fought win the united states is with him and the people of israel all the way  trump flags being waived at the bibi  victory celebration last night  everybody is now acknowledging that right from the time i announced my run for president i was 100percent correct on the border remember the heat i took democrats should now get rid of the loopholes the border is being fixed mexico will not let people through the democrats must end the loopholes on immigration so easy to solve the underlying issue remains the same without a single american being indicted for collusion with russia  that is a stunning end considering we were led to believe fake news that something much more dramatic would happen why did people fall for this  molly h thank you working hard  check this out truth  today it was my great honor to welcome president  of the arab republic of egypt to the   she congresswoman omar keeps on assaulting jews jeff ballabon b2 strategic ceo  what's completely unacceptable is for congesswoman omar to target jews in this case stephen miller jeff ballabon b2 strategic ceo   on national former prisoner of war recognition day we honor the americans captured and imprisoned by foreign powers while carrying out their duties to defend this great nation the mainstream media has never been more inaccurate or corrupt than it is today it only seems to get worse so much fake news i got along very well with jerry during the zoning and building process then i changed course slightly became president and now i am dealing with congressman nadler again some things never end but hopefully it will all go well for everyone only time will tell congressman jerry nadler fought me for years on a very large development i built on the west side of manhattan he wanted a rail yard built underneath the development or even better to stop the job he didn't get either  the development became very successful nevertheless the world trade organization finds that the european union subsidies to airbus has adversely impacted the united states which will now put tariffs on $11 billion of eu products the eu has taken advantage of the us on trade for many years it will soon stop make america great again  congratulations to virginia great game a 9th circuit judge just ruled that mexico is too dangerous for migrants so unfair to the us out of control  congratulations to the baylor lady bears on their amazing win last night against notre dame to become the 2019 ncaa women's basketball national champions  the democrats will never be satisfied no matter what they get how much they get or how many pages they get it will never end but that's the way life goes uganda must find the kidnappers of the american tourist and guide before people will feel safe in going there bring them to justice openly and quickly jerry nadler is not entitled to this information he is doing this to get it to the democrat 2020 nominee  the reason the whole process seems so politicized is that democrats made up this complete lie about collusion and none of it happened charles hurt the russian hoax never happened it was a fraud on the american people mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the united states or we will have no other choice than to close the border and/or institute tariffs our country is full more apprehensions capturesat the southern border than in many years border patrol amazing country is full system has been broken for many years democrats in congress must agree to fix loopholes no open borders crimes  drugs will close southern border if necessary i am pleased to announce that kevin mcaleenan the current us customs and border protection commissioner will become acting secretary for  i have confidence that kevin will do a great job secretary of homeland security kirstjen nielsen will be leaving her position and i would like to thank her for her service pleased to report that the american tourist and tour guide that were abducted in uganda have been released god bless them and their families looks like bob mueller's team of 13 trump haters  angry democrats are illegally leaking information to the press while the fake news media make up their own stories with or without sources sources no longer matter to our corrupt  dishonest mainstream media they are a joke in the meantime the democrats in congress must help the republicans we need their votes to end the horrible costly and foolish loopholes in our immigration laws once that happens all will be smooth we can never allow open borders it's powerful common sense immigration laws to stop illegals from coming through mexico into the us and removing them back to their country of origin until mexico cleans up this ridiculous  massive migration we will be focusing on border security not ports of entry we have redeployed 750 agents at the southern border's specific ports of entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the united states this will cause traffic  commercial delays until such time as mexico is able to use give up trump-haters  why should i be defending a fraudulent russian witch hunt it's about time the perpetrators of this fraud on me and the american people start defending their dishonest and treasonous acts how and why did this terrible event begin never forget to every member of the  thank you for your incredible support and your outstanding commitment to our country to our safety and to electing more republicans over the next 19 months i know that the  will help lead our party to another historic victory    against something i knew never existed collusion with russia so ridiculous no obstruction this russia hoax must never happen to another president and law enforcement must find out how did it start so let's get this straight there was no collusion and in fact the phony dossier was a con job that was paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc so the 13 angry democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up fraud i just fought back will be speaking today at the republican jewish coalition  meeting in las vegas nevada see everyone soon  years and $30 million and they found no collusion no obstruction but the democrats no matter what we give them will never be satisfied a total waste of time as  has just stated enough america has had enough what have you accomplished public is fed up i have not read the mueller report yet even though i have every right to do so only know the conclusions and on the big one no collusion likewise recommendations made to our great ag who found no obstruction 13 angry trump hating dems later brought to 18 given two thank you to two great people  collusion was a hoax from day one    the lowest average jobs number for any president since 1951 41percent economy doing great if the democrats win it is all over     i agree so let's get this straight there was no collusion and in fact the phony dossier was a con job that was paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc so the 13 angry democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up fraud i just fought back thank you   and   congratulations david a very big deal  just checked out the new wall on the border great leaving now for la join me in california for a roundtable on immigration and border security  just arrived in calexico california  will soon be landing in calexico california to look at a portion of the new wall being built on our southern border within two years we will have close to 400 miles built or under construction  keeping our country safe  not easy when the dems are always fighting to stop you the press is doing everything within their power to fight the magnificence of the phrase make america great again they can't stand the fact that this administration has done more than virtually any other administration in its first 2yrs they are truly the enemy of the people america created 196000 jobs in march beating expectations for 170000  i've employed thousands of electrical workers they will be voting for me congratulations to brian hagedorn on his big surprise win over a well funded liberal democrat in the great state of wisconsin for a very important supreme court seat republicans are producing big for wisconsin jobs jobs jobs  heading to the southern border to show a section of the new wall being built leaving now this will supersede usmca likewise i am looking at an economic penalty for the 500 billion dollars in illegal drugs that are shipped and smuggled through mexico and across our southern border over 10000 americans die each year sooo many families destroyed however if for any reason mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from the us will be forced to tariff at 25percent all cars made in mexico and shipped over the border to us if that doesn't work which it will i will close the border the crazed and dishonest washington post again purposely got it wrong mexico for the first time in decades is meaningfully apprehending illegals at their southern border before the long march up to the us this is great and the way it should be the big flow will stop trolling the mueller report democrats lost on collusion now they're inventing a coverup   james freeman  i am pleased to announce that jovita carranza will be nominated as the new  administrator she will be replacing linda mcmahon who has done an outstanding job jovita was a great treasurer of the united states  and i look forward to her joining my cabinet  how bad does border have to be for democrats to admit it's an emergency  conservative support for trump wall soars to 99 percent  democrats need to help fix the border crisis or get out of trump's way  thank you   welcome back joe  the new york times had no legitimate sources which would be totally illegal concerning the mueller report in fact they probably had no sources at all they are a fake news paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me there is nothing we can ever give to the democrats that will make them happy this is the highest level of presidential harassment in the history of our country according to polling few people seem to care about the russian collusion hoax but some democrats are fighting hard to keep the witch hunt alive they should focus on legislation or even better an investigation of how the ridiculous collusion delusion got started so illegal despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the fed the economy is looking very strong the china and usmca deals are moving along nicely there is little or no inflation and usa optimism is very high the republican party is the party of the american dream the first step act proves that our country can achieve amazing breakthroughs when we put politics aside and put the interests of all americans first   congress must get together and immediately eliminate the loopholes at the border if no action border or large sections of border will close this is a national emergency this will be a great campaign issue i never asked mitch mcconnell for a vote before the election as has been incorrectly reported as usual in the  but only after the election when we take back the house etc republicans will always support pre-existing conditions i was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 election on the wonderful healthcare package that some very talented people are now developing for me  the republican party it will be on full display during the election as a much better  less expensive alternative to obamacare today it was my great honor to welcome  secretary general  to the   today we celebrate the tremendous accomplishments of americans with asd and reaffirm our commitment to work together to ensure that every member of our society is afforded equal opportunities to reach their full potential  i haven't seen any democrats down here at the border working with us or asking to speak to any of us they have an open invitation we are getting overrun our facilities are overcapacity we are at an emergency crisis art del cueto national border patrol council after many years decades mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their southern border mostly from guatemala honduras and el salvador they have all been taking us money for years and doing absolutely nothing for us just like the democrats in congress there is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy jerry nadler or shifty adam schiff it is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great country robert mueller was a god-like figure to the democrats until he ruled no collusion in the long awaited $30000000 mueller report now the dems don't even acknowledge his name have become totally unhinged and would like to go through the whole process again it won't happen world autism awareness day 2019 significance history and theme via   in 1998 repjerry nadler strongly opposed the release of the starr report on bill clinton no information whatsoever would or could be legally released but with the no collusion mueller report which the dems hate he wants it all nothing will ever satisfy them  the best thing that ever happened to puerto rico is president donald j trump so many wonderful people but with such bad island leadership and with so much money wasted cannot continue to hurt our farmers and states with these massive payments and so little appreciation puerto rico got 91 billion dollars for the hurricane more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before  all their local politicians do is complain  ask for more money the pols are grossly incompetent spend the money foolishly or corruptly  only take from usa the crazed and incompetent mayor of san juan have done such a poor job  of bringing the island back to health 91 billion dollars to puerto rico and now the dems want to give them more taking dollars away from our farmers and so many others disgraceful are great but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt puerto rico got far more money than texas  florida combined yet their government can't do anything right the place is a mess nothing works fema  the military worked emergency miracles but politicians like the democrats today killed a bill that would have provided great relief to farmers and yet more money to puerto rico despite the fact that puerto rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any place in history the people of puerto rico back the house it will be truly great healthcare that will work for america also republicans will always support pre-existing conditions the republican party will be known as the party of great healtcare meantime the usa is doing better than ever  is respected again are developing a really great healthcare plan with far lower premiums cost  deductibles than obamacare in other words it will be far less expensive  much more usable than obamacare vote will be taken right after the election when republicans hold the senate  win everybody agrees that obamacare doesn't work premiums  deductibles are far too high really bad healthcare even the dems want to replace it but with medicare for all which would cause 180 million americans to lose their beloved private health insurance the republicans democrats should stop fighting sen david perdue's disaster relief bill they are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural america no matter what information is given to the crazed democrats from the no collusion mueller report it will never be good enough behind closed doors the dems are laughing the cost of obamacare is far too high for our great citizens the deductibles in many cases way over $7000 make it almost worthless or unusable good things are going to happen       can you believe that the radical left democrats want to do our new and very important census report without the all important citizenship question report would be meaningless and a waste of the $billions ridiculous that it costs to put together democrats working with republicans in congress can fix the asylum and other loopholes quickly we have a major national emergency at our border get it done now now that the long awaited mueller report conclusions have been released most democrats and othershave gone back to the pre-witch hunt phase of their lives before collusion delusion took over others are pretending that their former hero bob mueller no longer exists the democrats are allowing a ridiculous asylum system and major loopholes to remain as a mainstay of our immigration system mexico is likewise doing nothing a very bad combination for our country homeland security is being sooo very nice but not for long outrageous it's the adam schiff problem people abusing the access to classified data to then go out in public and make allegations that didn't prove to be true you look at a decision to essentially investigate a political rival who made it james freeman  everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the no collusion no obstruction trump campaign began we need to know for future generations to understand this hoax should never be allowed to happen to another president or administration again the trump administration has succeeded in dramatically raising the costs to iran for its sinister behavior at no cost to the us or our allies that's the definition of a foreign-policy achievement bret stephens   we are getting stronger all over the world watch mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the usa our detention areas are maxed out  we will take no more illegals next step is to close the border this will also help us with stopping the drug flow from mexico it would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid democrat inspired immigration laws in less than one hour and then a vote the problem would be solved but the dems don't care about the crime they don't want any victory for trump and the republicans even if good for usa in honor of his past service to our country navy seal  will soon be moved to less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court process should move quickly   a huge thanks to  for serving america at the  great work i'm proud to have you join the fulbright board  so funny that the new york times  the washington post got a pulitzer prize for their coverage 100percent negative and fake of collusion with russia and there was no collusion so they were either duped or corrupt in any event their prizes should be taken away by the committee the problem is no matter what the radical left democrats get no matter what we give them it will never be enough just watch they will harass  complain  resist the theme of their movement so maybe we should just take our victory and say no we've got a country to run robert mueller was a hero to the radical left democrats until he ruled that there was no collusion with russia so ridiculous to even say after more than two years since the insurance policy statement was made by a dirty cop i got the answers i wanted the truth had the fed not mistakenly raised interest rates especially since there is very little inflation and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening the 30percent gdp  stock market would have both been much higher  world markets would be in a better place the border or large sections of the border next week this would be so easy for mexico to do but they just take our money and talk besides we lose so much money with them especially when you add in drug trafficking etc that the border closing would be a good thing through their country and our southern border mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the us far greater than border costs if mexico doesn't immediately stop all illegal immigration coming into the united states throug our southern border i will be closing the democrats have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the world mexico has the strongest  they make more than $100 billion a year on the us therefore congress must change our weak immigration laws now  mexico must stop illegals from entering the us this has been an incredible couple of weeks for america  on this vietnam war veterans day we celebrate the brave vietnam veterans and all of america's veterans thank you

dems refuse to do what they know is necessary amend our immigration laws would immediately solve the problem mexico with the strongest immigration laws in the world refuses to help with illegal immigration  drugs the republican party will become the party of great healthcare obamacare is a disaster far too expensive and deductibility ridiculously high virtually unusable moving forward in courts and legislatively very important that opec increase the flow of oil world markets are fragile price of oil getting too high thank you wow ratings for morning joe which were really bad in the first place just tanked with the release of the mueller report likewise other shows on msnbc and cnn have gone down by as much as 50percent just shows fake news never wins congressman adam schiff who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking should be forced to resign from congress fbi  doj to review the outrageous jussie smollett case in chicago it is an embarrassment to our nation mexico is doing nothing to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our country they are all talk and no action likewise honduras guatemala and el salvador have taken our money for years and do nothing the dems don't care such bad laws may close the southern border the fake news media is going crazy they are suffering a major breakdown have zero credibility or respect  must be thinking

me tv ratings of cnn  msnbc tanked last night after seeing the mueller report statement  up big i think this is probably the most consequential media screwup of the last 25 to 50 years it is difficult

heights as part of the state of israel   thank you to the house republicans for sticking together and the big win today on the border today's vote simply reaffirms congressional democrats are the party of open borders drugs and crime a catastrophic media failure  the republican party will become the party of healthcare what we're seeing on capitol hill right now is that the democrats are walking back any charges of collusion against the president   should never have been started a disgrace the mainstream media is under fire and being scorned all over the world as being corrupt and fake for two years they pushed the russian collusion delusion when they always knew there was no collusion they truly are the enemy of the people and the real opposition party what we're seeing on

age to 16 abolish the electoral college and increase significantly the number of supreme court justices actually you've got to win it at the ballot box not a good situation  just the large states the cities would end up running the country smaller states  the entire midwest would end up losing all power  we can't let that happen i used to like the idea of the popular vote but now realize the electoral college is far better for the usa campaigning for the popular vote is much easier  different than campaigning for the electoral college it's like training for the 100 yard dash vs a marathon the brilliance of the electoral college is that you must go to many states to win with the popular vote you go to thank you  could not have said it any better myself  amazingly cnn just released a poll at 71percent saying that the economy is in the best shape since 2001 18 years wow is cnn becoming a believer i will be looking into this   facebook google and twitter not to mention the corrupt

protesters i guess not so well in the meantime the united states has gone to the top of all lists on the environment google is helping china and their military but not the us terrible the good news is that they helped crooked hillary clinton and not trumpand how did that turn out because the economy is so good general motors must get their lordstown ohio plant open maybe in a different form or with a new owner fast toyota is investing 135 $billion in us others likewise gm must act quickly time is of the essence spreading the fake and totally discredited dossier is unfortunately a very dark stain against john mccain ken starr former independent counsel he had far worse stains than this including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace this is a national emergency mark morgan former border patrol chief with great experience in law enforcement really understands the subjects of immigration and the border thank you mark   veto message to the house of representatives for hj res 46   on the recent non-binding vote 420-0 in congress about releasing the mueller report i told leadership to let all republicans vote for transparency makes us all look good and doesn't matter play along with the game just spoke w/  the people of nebraska  across the midwest especially the farmers  ranchers are feeling the impacts from severe weather the first responders  emergency response teams have done a great job dealing w/ record flooding high winds  road closures that we stand in solidarity with new zealand  and that any assistance the usa can give we stand by ready to help we love you new zealand just spoke with jacinda ardern the prime minister of new zealand regarding the horrific events that have taken place over the past 24 hours i informed the prime minister i'd like to thank all of the great republican senators who bravely voted for strong border security and the wall this will help stop crime human trafficking and drugs entering our country watch when you get back to your state they will love you more than ever before this should never happen to a president again should never have been appointed and there should be no mueller report this was an illegal  conflicted investigation in search of a crime russian collusion was nothing more than an excuse by the democrats for losing an election that they thought they were going to win so if there was knowingly  acknowledged to be zero crime when the special counsel was appointed and if the appointment was made based on the fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary and now disgraced andrew mccabe he  all stated no crime then the special counsel new evidence that the obama era team of the fbi doj  cia were working together to spy on and take out president trump all the way back in 2015 a transcript of peter strzok's testimony is devastating hopefully the mueller report will be covering this   the ‘jexodus' movement encourages jewish people to leave the democrat party total disrespect republicans are waiting with open arms remember jerusalem us embassy and the horrible iran nuclear deal    my warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of new zealand after the horrible massacre in the mosques 49 innocent people have so senselessly died with so many more seriously injured the us stands by new zealand for anything we can do god bless all breitbart news network  via  i look forward to vetoing the just passed democrat inspired resolution which would open borders while increasing crime drugs and trafficking in our country i thank all of the strong republicans who voted to support border security and our desperately needed wall veto congratulations  big news for us auto workers the usmca is already fixing the broken nafta deal  a vote for today's resolution by republican senators is a vote for nancy pelosi crime and the open border democrats if at a later date congress wants to update the law i will support those efforts but today's issue is border security and crime don't vote with pelosi prominent legal scholars agree that our actions to address the national emergency at the southern border and to protect the american people are both constitutional and expressly authorized by congress happy national ag day  the three very weak and untalented late night hosts are fighting over table scraps carson did a great job it wasn't political i don't know what they're going to do in 2024 when he's no longer president  will be wacky in the unemployment line michael loftus  the democrats are border deniers they refuse to see or acknowledge the death crime drugs and human trafficking at our southern border my administration looks forward to negotiating a large scale trade deal with the united kingdom the potential is unlimited a big national emergency vote today by the united states senate on border security  the wall which is already under major construction i am prepared to veto if necessary the southern border is a national security and humanitarian nightmare but it can be easily fixed democrats are frantic to throw something else at the president that's why you saw those 81 subpoenas it's ridiculous just because your still upset over an election that happened 2 1/2 years ago you should not be allowed to ruin people's lives like this lara trump  i agree with rand paul this is a total disgrace and should never happen to another president  the lisa page fbi transcript also confirms earlier reporting that page testified russian collusion was still unproven when special counsel robert mueller was appointed catherine herridge   in other words they appointed someone when there was and is no crime bad double standard former fbi lawyer lisa page admits being told to go easy on clinton  very unfair   republican senators are overthinking tomorrow's vote on national emergency it is very simply border security/no crime should not be thought of any other way we have a major national emergency at our border and the people of our country know it very well democrats will have a unanimous vote on a 20percent issue in opposing republican senators tomorrow the dems are for open borders and crime comey testified under oath that it was a unanimous decision on crooked hillary lisa page transcripts show he lied  the fake news photoshopped pictures of melania then propelled conspiracy theories that it's actually not her by my side in alabama and other places they are only getting more deranged with time the just revealed fbi agent lisa page transcripts make the obama justice department look exactly like it was a broken and corrupt machine hopefully justice will finally be served much more to come defying voters the governor of california will halt all death penalty executions of 737 stone cold killers friends and families of the always forgotten victims are not thrilled and neither am i keep america great make america great again jay leno points out that comedy on the very boring late night shows is totally one-sided it's tough when there's only one topic   actually the one-sided hatred on these shows is incredible and for me unwatchable but remember we are number one president a man who is considered by many to be the president with the most successful first two years in history especially when he has done nothing wrong and impeachment is for high crimes and misdemeanors i greatly appreciate nancy pelosi's statement against impeachment but everyone must remember the minor fact that i never did anything wrong the economy and unemployment are the best ever military and vets are great and many other successes how do you impeach so many records being set with respect to our economy unemployment numbers among best ever a beautiful thing to watch all part of the witch hunt hoax started by little eric schneiderman  cuomo so many leaving new york  all part of the witch hunt hoax started by little eric schneiderman  coumo so many leaving new york  rt  the ny attorney general called president trump an illegitimate president she has proven to have a vendetta against  all part of the witch hunt  new york state and its governor andrew cuomo are now proud members of the group of presidential harassers no wonder people are fleeing the state in record numbers the witch hunt continues needed and the complexity creates danger all of this for great cost yet very little gain i don't know about you but i don't want albert einstein to be my pilot i want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly pilots are no longer needed but rather computer scientists from mit i see it all the time in many products always seeking to go one unnecessary step further when often old and simpler is far better split second decisions are patrick moore co-founder of greenpeace the whole climate crisis is not only fake news it's fake science there is no climate crisis there's weather and climate all around the world and in fact carbon dioxide is the main building block of all life   wow jewish people are leaving the democratic party we saw a lot of anti israel policies start under the obama administration and it got worsts  worse there is anti-semitism in the democratic party they don't care about israel or the jewish people elizabeth pipko jexodus republican senators have a very easy vote this week it is about border security and the wall stopping crime drugs etc not constitutionality and precedent it is an 80percent positive issue the dems are 100percent united as usual on a 20percent issue open borders and crime get tough r's making daylight saving time permanent is ok with me at a recent round table meeting of business executives  long after formally introducing tim cook of apple i quickly referred to tim + apple as tim/apple as an easy way to save time  words the fake news was disparagingly all over this  it became yet another bad trump story there's not one shred of evidence that president trump has done anything wrong  one america news  so true a total witch hunt all started illegally by crooked hillary clinton the dnc and others more people are working today in the united states 158000000 than at any time in our country's history that is a big deal despite the most hostile and corrupt media in the history of american politics the trump administration has accomplished more in its first two years than any other administration judges biggest tax  regulation cuts va choice best economy lowest unemployment  much more donald trump's approval rating is at or near his highest level ever the media is not being honest about what is happening in this country jesse watters will soon be 145 judges  this is just the beginning  the witch hunt continues  and renovated with much more to follow shortly tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended captured at the border and not allowed into our country with another president millions would be pouring in i am stopping an invasion as the wall gets built  wacky nut job  who still hasn't figured out that despite all odds and an entire democrat party of far left radicals against me not to mention certain republicans who are sadly unwilling to fight i am winning on the border major sections of wall are being built i hope the grandstanding governor of california is able to spend his very highly taxed citizens money on asylum holds more efficiently than money has been spent on the so-called fast train which is $billions over budget  in total disarray time to reduce taxes in california border patrol and law enforcement has apprehended captured large numbers of illegal immigrants at the border they won't be coming into the us the wall is being built and will greatly help us in the future and now   the only time that michael cohen told the truth is when he pled that he is guilty  also when he said no collusion and i did not tell him to lie unimaginable loss such great people  sessions didn't have a clue  aluminum prices are down 12percent since i instituted tariffs on aluminum dumping and the us will be taking in billions plus jobs nice as secretary of the air force and i know she will be equally great in the very important world of higher education a strong thank you to heather for her service congratulations to heather wilson who is the sole finalist to become the next president of university of texas at el paso effective september 1 2019 heather has done an absolutely fantastic job bad lawyer and fraudster michael cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a pardon his lawyers totally contradicted him he lied additionally he directly asked me for a pardon i said no he lied again he also badly wanted to work at the white house he lied heading now to the great state of alabama on international women's day we honor women worldwide for their vital role in shaping and strengthening our communities families governments and businesses women's unemployment rate is down to 36percent was 79percent in january 2011 things are looking good we are apprehending record numbers of illegal immigrants but we need the wall to help our great border patrol agents this is as good a time as i can remember to be an american worker we have the strongest economy in the world  stuart varney   so true both the judge and the lawyer in the paul manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was no collusion with russia but the witch hunt hoax continues as you now add these statements to house  senate intelligence  senator burr so bad for our country presidential harassment i cannot believe the level of dishonesty in the media it is totally out of control but we are winning thank you  great show the wall is being built and is well under construction big impact will be made many additional contracts are close to being signed far ahead of schedule despite all of the democrat obstruction and fake news breaking news  cohen's lawyer contradicts cohen's testimony about never seeking a presidential pardon we are on track to apprehend more than one million people coming across the southern border this year great job by border patrol and others who are working in a broken system can be fixed by congress so easily and quickly if only the democrats would get on board it was not a campaign contribution and there were no violations of the campaign finance laws by me fake news democrats just blocked  from holding a debate good then i think i'll do the same thing with the fake news networks and the radical left democrats in the general election debates wall street journal more migrant families crossing into the us illegally have been arrested in the first five months of the federal fiscal year than in any prior full year we are doing a great job at the border but this is a national emergency congressman chris stewart no one is accusing the president of a crime and yet they the democrats are issuing hundreds of subpoenas this is unprecedented they are desperately trying to find anything they can even a punctuation mistake in a document american workforce policy advisory board meeting at the   it is shameful that house democrats won't take a stronger stand against anti-semitism in their conference anti-semitism has fueled atrocities throughout history and it's inconceivable they will not act to condemn it senate republicans are not voting on constitutionality or precedent they are voting on desperately needed border security  the wall our country is being invaded with drugs human traffickers  criminals of all shapes and sizes that's what this vote is all about stay united weirdo tom steyer doesn't have the guts or money to run for president he's all talk  hans von spakovsky i haven't seen any evidence of actual violations of the law which is usually a basis before you start an investigation adam schiff seems to be copying joseph mccarthy in wanting to open up investigations when they don't have any evidence of wrongdoing presidential harassment  crooked hillary clinton confirms she will not run in 2020 rules out a third bid for white house aw-shucks does that mean i won't get to run against her again she will be sorely missed scott has helped us to lower drug prices get a record number of generic drugs approved and onto the market and so many other things he and his talents will be greatly missed scott gottlieb who has done an absolutely terrific job as commissioner of the fda plans to leave government service sometime next month just a few moments ago i signed an eo addressing one of our nation's most heartbreaking tragedies veterans suicide to every veterani want you to know that you have an entire nation of more than 300 million

dems are obstructing justice and will not get anything done a big fat fishing expedition desperately in search of a crime when in fact the real crime is what the dems are doing and have done hiv is cured in 2nd patient doctors report   such great news for so many tremendous progress being made now that they realize the only collusion with russia was done by crooked hillary clinton  the democrats nadler schiff and the dem heads of the committees have gone stone cold crazy 81 letter sent to innocent people to harass them they won't get anything done for our country  is indeed a star thank you center for urban renewal  ed   representative ilhan omar is again under fire for her terrible comments concerning israel jewish groups have just sent a petition to speaker pelosi asking her to remove omar from foreign relations committee a dark day for israel we the people will now be subjected to the biggest display of modern day mccarthyismwhich is the widest fishing net expeditionevery aspect of the presidents lifeall in order to get power back so they can institute socialism  we the people will now be subjected to the biggest display of modern day mccathyismwhich is the widest fishing net expeditionevery aspect of the presidents lifeall in order to get power back so they can institute socialism   amazon like the washington post it's hard to remember that not so long ago america had prestige media outlets but not anymore    the fake news media is the true enemy of the people the american media has changed forever news organizations that seemed like a big deal are now extinct  those that remain have now degraded themselves beyond recognition like the new yorker or they've been purchased by jeff bezos to conduct unregistered lobbying for presidential harassment  there is no collusion all of these investigations are in search of a crime democrats have no evidence to impeach president trump ridiculous   now that the dems are going to try  switch from collusion to some other reason it makes them continue to look like sore losers who didn't accept the will of the people in the last election they will do anything to get rid of the president  it will never work the military drills or war games as i call them were never even discussed in my mtg w/ kim jong un of nkfake news i made that decision long ago because it costs the us far too much money to have those games especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost fema has been told directly by me to give the a plus treatment to the great state of alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the tornadoes  one of the best in our country has been so informed she is working closely with fema and me to the great people of alabama and surrounding areas please be careful and safe tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming to the families and friends of the victims and to the injured god bless you all fema has been told directly by me to give the a plus treatment to the great state of alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the tornadoes  one of the best in our country has been so informed she is working closely with fema and me and also illegally leaking to fake news cnn  others  schumer  the democrats are hurting our country senate republicans must take bold action  rt   president trump made america great again  now it's up to us to help him keep america great  for the democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar  fraudster at the same time as the very important nuclear summit with north korea is perhaps a new low in american politics and may have contributed to the walk never done when a president is overseas shame president we are winning big the envy of the world but just think what it could be presidential harassment by crazed democrats at the highest level in the history of our country likewise the most vicious and corrupt mainstream media that any president has ever had to endure yet the most successful first two years for any the reason i do not want military drills with south korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the us for which we are not reimbursed that was my position long before i became president also reducing tensions with north korea at this time is a good thing my wonderful daughter ivanka will be interviewed tonight by steve hilton on the next revolution  9:00 pm she works so hard and has achieved so much for the usaand gets so little credit then watch mark levin at 10:00 pm a great show look how they're acting now and how we act when we're in the majority what the democrats are doing is an abuse of power they couldn't find anythingthey took a fake dossier  couldn't find any collusion now they have a fake witness in cohen congressman mark green r-tn after more than two years of presidential harassment the only things that have been proven is that democrats and other broke the law the hostile cohen testimony given by a liar to reduce his prison time proved no collusion his just written book manuscript showed what he said was a total lie but fake media won't show it i am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad conflicted  corrupt people in a witch hunt that is illegal  should never have been allowed to start and only because i won the election despite this great success we've got nasa rocking again great activity and success congrats to spacex and all the brand new manuscript for a new book by failed lawyer michael cohen shows his testimony was a total lie pundits should only use it virtually everything failed lawyer michael cohen said in his sworn testimony last week is totally contradicted in his just released manuscript for a book about me it's a total new love letter to trump and the pols must now use it rather than his lies for sentence reduction thank you    it was a 3 day train ride to vietnam not 3 hours will be speaking at cpac at 11:30 this morning record crowd live broadcast enjoy very proud of perhaps the greatest golf course anywhere in the world also furthers uk relationship  and i did not increase their second traunch of tariffs to 25percent on march 1st this is very important for our great farmers and me i have asked china to immediately remove all tariffs on our agricultural products including beef pork etc based on the fact that we are moving along nicely with trade discussions for otto's mistreatment and death most important otto warmbier will not have died in vain otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength which will last for many years into the future i love otto and think of him often i never like being misinterpreted but especially when it comes to otto warmbier and his great family remember i got otto out along with three others the previous administration did nothing and he was taken on their watch of course i hold north korea responsible michael cohen's book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before he must have forgotten about his book when he testified what does hillary clinton's lawyer lanny davis say about this one is he being paid by crooked hillary using her lawyer and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on wednesday no way it's time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought witch hunt time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed republicans have been abused long enough must end now oh' i see now that the 2 year russian collusion case has fallen apart there was no collusion except bye crooked hillary and the democrats they say gee i have an idea let's look at trump's finances and every deal he has ever done let's follow discredited michael cohen congress must demand the transcript of michael cohen's new book given to publishers a short time ago your heads will spin when you see the lies misrepresentations and contradictions  against his thursday testimony like a different person he is totally discredited wow just revealed that michael cohen wrote a love letter to trump manuscript for a new book that he was pushing written and submitted long after charlottesville and helsinki his phony reasons for going rogue book is exact opposite of his fake testimony which now is a lie great to be back from vietnam an amazing place we had very substantive negotiations with kim jong un

chrysler they are all coming back to the usa it's where the action is michael cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me unfortunately he had other clients also he was just disbarred by the state supreme court for lying  fraud he did bad things unrelated to trump he is lying in order to reduce his prison time using crooked's lawyer i have now spent more time in vietnam than da nang dick blumenthal the third rate senator from connecticut how is connecticut doing his war stories of his heroism in vietnam were a total fraud he was never even there we talked about it today with vietnamese leaders the democrats should stop talking about what i should do with north korea and ask themselves instead why they didn't do it during eight years of the obama administration vietnam is thriving like few places on earth north korea would be the same and very quickly if it would denuclearize the potential is awesome a great opportunity like almost none other in history for my friend kim jong un we will know fairly soon very interesting just arrived in vietnam thank you to all of the people for the great reception in hanoi tremendous crowds and so much love this will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of congress if there is one thing we should all agree on it's protecting the lives of innocent babies senate democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children the democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don't mind executing babies after birth if a deal is made with china our great american farmers will be treated better than they have ever been treated before heading over to vietnam for my meeting with kim jong un looking forward to a very productive summit china trade deal and more in advanced stages relationship between our two countries is very strong i have therefore agreed to delay us tariff hikes let's see what happens our foreign partners recovering american hostages is a priority of my admin and with danny's release we have now secured freedom for 20 american captives since my election victory we will not rest as we continue our work to bring the remaining american hostages back home danny's recovery reflects the best of what the united states  its partners can accomplishwe work every day to bring americans home we maintain constant and intensive diplomatic

with us be strong and smart don't fall into the democrats trap of open borders and crime former senator harry reid he got thrown out is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career he led

important summit with kim jong un with complete denuclearization north korea will rapidly become an economic powerhouse without it just more of the same chairman kim will make a wise decision oil

important structural issues including intellectual property protection technology transfer agriculture services currency and many other issues as a result of these very so funny to watch people who

states as soon as possible it is far more powerful faster and smarter than the current standard american companies must step up their efforts or get left behind there is no reason that we should be lagging behind on i have instructed secretary of state mike pompeo and he fully agrees not to allow hoda muthana back into the country we have just built this powerful wall in new mexico completed on january 30 2019  47 days ahead of schedule many miles more now under construction   california now wants to scale back their already failed fast train project by substantially shortening the distance so that it no longer goes from la to san francisco a different deal and record cost overruns send the federal government back the billions of dollars wasted the new york times reporting is false they are a true enemy of the people if thinking that james comey is not a good fbi director is tantamount to being an agent of russia than just list all the people that are agents of russia chuck schumer nancy pelosi rod rosenstein who wrote the memo to get rid of comey the inspector general trey gowdy the washington post ignored basic journalistic standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented biased agenda against president donald j trump covington student suing wapo go get them nick fake news the press has never been more dishonest than it is today stories are written that have absolutely no basis in fact the writers don't even call asking for verification they are totally out of control sadly i kept many of them in business in six years they all go bust crazy bernie has just entered the race i wish him well andrew mccabe gave absolutely no evidence of any threat to substantiate his absurd claim  i never said anything bad about andrew mccabe's wife other than she they should not have taken large amounts of campaign money from a crooked hillary source when clinton was under investigation by the fbi i never called his wife a loser to him another mccabe made up lie the washington post is a fact checker only for the democrats for the republicans and for your all time favorite president it is a fake fact checker the failed fast train project in california where the cost overruns are becoming world record setting is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed wall as i predicted 16 states led mostly by open border democrats and the radical left have filed a lawsuit in of course the 9th circuit california the state that has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control fast train with no hope of completion seems in charge the failed fast train project in california were the cost overruns are becoming world record setting is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed wall as i predicted 16 cities led mostly by open border democrats and the radical left have filed a lawsuit in of course the 9th circuit california the state that has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control fast train with no hope of completion seems in charge had the opposition party no not the media won the election the stock market would be down at least 10000 points by now we are heading up up up the witch hunt in time likely will become recognized as the greatest scandal in american political history marking the first occasion in which the us government bureaucrats sought to overturn an election

look like they were planning a very illegal act and got caught after two years and interviewing more than two hundred witnesses the senate intelligence committee has not discovered any direct evidence of a conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia  ken dilanian  william barr is arriving at a justice department that desperately needs an infusion of credibility writes   via  the mueller investigation is totally conflicted illegal and rigged should never have been allowed to begin except for the collusion and many crimes committed by the democrats witch hunt these guys the

of this country and mueller is a coverup  rush limbaugh the rigged and corrupt media is the enemy of the people nothing funny about tired saturday night live on fake news nbc question is how do the networks get away with these total republican hit jobs without retribution likewise for many other shows very unfair and should be looked into this is the real collusion 52percent approval rating

800 isis fighters that we captured in syria and put them on trial the caliphate is ready to fall the alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them trade negotiators have just

china in the form of trade tariffs building the wall great job by law enforcement in aurora illinois heartfelt condolences to all of the victims and their families america is with you trying to use

16 year high nice the senate intelligence committee there is no evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and russia i want to thank all republicans for the work you have done in dealing with the radical left on border security not an easy task but the wall is being built and will be a great achievement and contributor toward life and safety within our country rt  they are soooo beautiful and magnificent ❤️❤️❤️❤️  thank you to   will be getting almost $23 billion for border security regardless of wall money it is being built as we speak was just presented the concept and parameters of the border security deal by hard working senator richard shelby looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources beautiful evening in el paso texas last night god bless the usa  we are fighting for all americans from all backgrounds of every age race religion birthplace color  creed our agenda is not a partisan agenda  it is the mainstream common sense agenda of the american people thank you el paso texas i love you  coal is an important part of our electricity generation mix and  should give serious consideration to all factors before voting to close viable power plants like paradise  in kentucky ۴۰ سال فساد ۴۰ سال سرکوب ۴۰ سال ترور رژیم ایران فقط موجب #چهل_سال_شکست شده است مردم ایران که مدتهاست در رنجند شایسته آینده روشن تری هستند  40 years of corruption 40 years of repression 40 years of terror the regime in iran has produced only  the long-suffering iranian people deserve a much brighter future  will be heading to el paso very soon big speech on border security and much else tonight tremendous crowd see you later the democrats are so self righteous and angry loosen up and have some fun the country is doing well the democrats do not want us to detain or send back criminal aliens this is a brand new demand crazy no president ever worked harder than me cleaning up the mess i inherited fact checkers have become fake news    so true the us will soon control 100percent of isis territory in syria  do you believe this well it happened again amy klobuchar announced that she is running for president talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow ice and freezing temperatures bad timing by the end of her speech she looked like a snowmanwoman the border committee democrats are behaving all of a sudden irrationally not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed wall they overrode recommendations of border patrol experts but they don't even want to take muderers into custody what's going on president is on sound legal ground to declare a national emergency there have been 58 national emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976 and 31 right now that are currently active so this is hardly unprecedented congressman  the fact is when i took over as president our country was a mess depleted military endless wars a potential war with north korea va high taxes  too many regulations border immigration  healthcare problems  much more i had no choice but to work very long hours the media was able to get my work schedule something very easy to do but it should have been reported as a positive not negative when the term executive time is used i am generally working not relaxing in fact i probably work more hours than almost any past president it was a very bad week for the democrats with the great economic numbers the virginia disaster and the state of the union address now with the terrible offers being made by them to the border committee i actually believe they want a shutdown they want a new subject i don't think the dems on the border committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal they are offering very little money for the desperately needed border wall  now out of the blue want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention gallup poll open borders will potentially attract 42 million latin americans this would be a disaster for the us we need the wall now african americans are very angry at the double standard on full display in virginia senator richard burr the chairman of the senate intelligence committee just announced that after almost two years more than two hundred interviews and thousands of documents they have found no collusion between trump and russia is anybody really surprised by this i think it is very important for the democrats to press forward with their green new deal it would be great for the so-called carbon footprint to permanently eliminate all planes cars cows oil gas  the military even if no other country would do the same brilliant today elizabeth warren sometimes referred to by me as pocahontas joined the race for president will she run as our first native american presidential candidate or has she decided that after 32 years this is not playing so well anymore see you on the campaign trail liz the democrats just don't seem to want border security they are fighting border agents recommendations if you believe news reports they are not offering much for the wall they look to be making this a campaign issue the wall will get built one way or the other we have a great economy despite the obama administration and all of its job killing regulations and roadblocks if that thinking prevailed in the 2016 election the us would be in a depression right now we were heading down and don't let the democrats sound bites fool you the democrats in congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see when the republicans had the majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn the dems are trying to win an election in 2020 that they know they cannot legitimately win it was great meeting some of our outstanding young military personnel who were wounded in both syria and afghanistan their wounds are deep but their spirit is sooo high they will recoverer  be back very soon america loves them walter reed hospital is amazing thank you all rt  adam schiff glenn simpson and their forrest gump-like encounter in aspen  rt   rt  trump not only did senator burr's committee find no collusion by the trump campaign and russia it's important because t north korea under the leadership of kim jong un will become a great economic powerhouse he may surprise some but he won't surprise me because i have gotten to know him  fully understand how capable he is north korea will become a different kind of rocket an economic one my representatives have just left north korea after a very productive meeting and an agreed upon time and date for the second summit with kim jong un it will take place in hanoi vietnam on february 27  28 i look forward to seeing chairman kim  advancing the cause of peace i was a big fan of frank robinson both as a great player and man he was the first african american manager in baseball and was highly respected at everything he did he will he missed deepest sympathies to congresswoman debbie dingell and the entire family of john dingell longest serving congressman in country's history which if people understand politics means he was very smart a great reputation and highly respected man working hard thank you  it is all a giant and illegal hoax developed long before the election itself but used as an excuse by the democrats as to why crooked hillary clinton lost the election someday the fake news media will turn honest  report that donald j trump was actually a great candidate the mainstream media has refused to cover the fact that the head of the very important senate intelligence committee after two years of intensive study and access to intelligence that only they could get just stated that they have found no collusion between trump  russia now we find out that adam schiff was spending time together in aspen with glenn simpson of gps fusion who wrote the fake and discredited dossier even though simpson was testifying before schiff john solomon of  not only did senator burr's committee find no collusion by the trump campaign and russia it's important because they interviewed 200 witnesses and 300000 pages of documents  the committee has direct access to intelligence information that's classified  highly respected senator richard burr chairman of senate intelligence said today that after an almost two year investigation he saw no evidence of russia collusion we don't have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the trump campaign and russia  thank you so nice how well my state of the union speech was received thank you to all each year america pauses to remember its fallen astronaut heroes and the great accomplishments for which they strived  melania and i mourn their passing and take to heart the lessons of their lives and the greater human potential to which they continue to inspire  today it was my great honor to sign a presidential memorandum launching the women's global development and prosperity

failing pols were republicans far stronger action would be taken virginia will come back home republican in 2020 the dems and their committees are going nuts the republicans never did this to president obama there would be no time left to run government i hear other committee heads will do the same thing even stealing people who work at white house a continuation of witch hunt so now congressman adam schiff announces after having found zero russian collusion that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life both financial and personal even though there is no reason to be doing so never happened before unlimited presidential harassment rt    looking forward to tonight   melania and i send our greetings to those celebrating the lunar new year today people across the united states and around the world mark the beginning of the lunar new year with spectacular fireworks displays joyful festivals and family gatherings i see schumer is already criticizing my state of

had a real wall this would be a non-event i am pleased to announce that david bernhardt acting secretary of the interior will be nominated as secretary of the interior david has done a fantastic job from the day he arrived and we look forward to having his nomination officially confirmed with caravans marching through mexico and toward our country republicans must be prepared to do whatever is

gillespie who ran for governor of the great state of virginia against ralph northam must now be thinking malpractice and dereliction of duty with regard to his opposition research staff if they find that terrible picture before the election he wins by 20 points democrat governor ralph northam of virginia just stated i believe that i am not either of the people in that photo this was 24 hours after apologizing for appearing in the picture and after making the most horrible statement on super late term abortion unforgivable great morning at trump national golf club in jupiter florida with  and   national african american history month is an occasion to rediscover the enduring stories of african americans and the gifts of freedom purpose and opportunity they have bestowed on future generations thank you to senator rob portman and senator cory gardner for the early and warm endorsement we will all win in 2020 together great news on foxconn in wisconsin after my conversation with terry gou  jobs jobs jobs  best january for the dow in over 30 years we have by far the strongest economy in the world after 18 long years syria was loaded with isis until i came along we will soon have destroyed 100percent of the caliphate but will be watching them closely it is now time to start coming home and after many years spending our money wisely certain people must get smart i inherited a total mess in syria and afghanistan the endless wars of unlimited spending and death during my campaign i said very strongly that these wars must finally end we spend $50 billion a year in afghanistan and have hit them so hard that we are now talking peace this witch hunt must end  nellie ohr the wife of doj official bruce ohr was long ago investigating for pay gps fusion members of my family feeding it to her husband who was then giving it to the fbi even though it was created by ousted  discredited christopher steele illegal witch hunt just out the big deal very mysterious don jr telephone calls after the innocent trump tower meeting that the media  dems said were made to his father me were just conclusively found not to be made to me they were made to friends  business associates of don really sad our great us border patrol agents made the biggest fentanyl bust in our country's history thanks as always for a job well done i would suggest you read the complete testimony from tuesday a false narrative is so bad for our country i value our intelligence community happily we had a very good meeting and we are all on the same page just concluded a great meeting with my intel team in the oval office who told me that what they said on tuesday at the senate hearing was mischaracterized by the media and we are very much in agreement on iran isis north korea etc their testimony was distorted press  very sadly murder cases in mexico in 2018 rose 33percent from 2017 to 33341 this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crisis taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout our country worse even than afghanistan much caused by drugs wall is being built schumer and the democrats are big fans of being weak and passive with iran they have no clue as to the danger they would be inflicting on our country iran is in financial chaos now because of the sanctions and iran deal termination dems put us in a bad place but now good looking for china to open their markets not only to financial services which they are now doing but also to our manufacturing farmers and other us businesses and industries without this a deal would be unacceptable more troops being sent to the southern border to stop the attempted invasion of illegals through large caravans into our country we have stopped the previous caravans and we will stop these also with a wall it would be soooo much easier and less expensive being built democrats are becoming the party of late term abortion high taxes open borders and crime republicans on the homeland security committee are wasting their time democrats despite all of the evidence proof and caravans coming are not going to give money to build the desperately needed wall i've got you covered wall is already being built i don't expect much help china's representatives and i are trying to do a complete deal leaving nothing unresolved on the table all of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully resolved tariffs on china increase to 25percent on march 1st so all working hard to complete by that date meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in the oval office no final deal will be made until my friend president xi and i meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the long standing and more difficult points very comprehensive transaction china's top trade negotiators are in the us meeting with our representatives meetings are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides china does not want an increase in tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal they are correct i will be with murders up 33percent in mexico a record why wouldn't any sane person want to build a wall construction has started and will not stop until it is finished   very sadly murder cases in mexico in 2018 rose 33percent from 2017 to 33341 this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crises taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout our country worse even than afghanistan much caused by drugs wall is being built lets just call them walls from now on and stop playing political games a wall is a wall large sections of wall have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go renovation of existing walls is also a very big part of the plan to finally after many decades properly secure our border the wall is getting done one way or the other so great to watch  listen to all these people who write books  talk about my presidential campaign and so many others things related to winning and how i should be doing it as i take it all in i then sit back look around  say gee i'm in the white house  they're not large protests all across venezuela today against maduro the fight for freedom has begun spoke today with venezuelan interim president juan guaido to congratulate him on his historic assumption of the presidency and reinforced strong united states support for venezuela's fight to regain its democracy dow just broke 25000 tremendous news a source of potential danger and conflict they are testing rockets last week and more and are coming very close to the edge there economy is now crashing which is the only thing holding them back be careful of iran perhaps intelligence should go back to school the intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of iran they are wrong when i became president iran was making trouble all over the middle east and beyond since ending the terrible iran nuclear deal they are much different but three separate caravans marching to our border the numbers are tremendous  if the committee of republicans and democrats now meeting on border security is not discussing or contemplating a wall or physical barrier they are wasting their time time will tell what will happen with north korea but at the end of the previous administration relationship was horrendous and very bad things were about to happen now a whole different story i look forward to seeing kim jong un shortly progress being made-big difference fighting continues but the people of afghanistan want peace in this never ending war we will soon see if talks will be successful north korea relationship is best it has ever been with us no testing getting remains hostages returned decent chance of denuclearization when i became president isis was out of control in syria  running rampant since then tremendous progress made especially over last 5 weeks caliphate will soon be destroyed unthinkable two years ago negotiating are proceeding well in afghanistan after 18 years of fighting maduro willing to negotiate with opposition in venezuela following us sanctions and the cutting off of oil revenues guaido is being targeted by venezuelan supreme court massive protest expected today americans should not travel to venezuela until further notice our economy right now is the gold standard throughout the world   so true and not even close a low level staffer that i hardly knew named cliff sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories and fiction he pretended to be an insider when in fact he was nothing more than a gofer he signed a non-disclosure agreement he is a mess how does da nang dick blumenthal serve on the senate judiciary committee when he defrauded the american people about his so called war hero status in vietnam only to later admit with tears pouring down his face that he was never in vietnam an embarrassment to our country in the beautiful midwest windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees the coldest ever recorded in coming days expected to get even colder people can't last outside even for minutes what the hell is going on with global waming please come back fast we need you in the media's effort to destroy the president they are actually destroying themselves given all of the tremendous headwinds this president has faced it's amazing he has accomplished so much deroy murdock   i agree howard schultz doesn't have the guts to run for president watched him on  last night and i agree with him that he is not the smartest person besides america already has that i only hope that starbucks is still paying me their rent in trump tower numerous states introducing bible literacy classes giving students the option of studying the bible starting to make a turn back great tariffs on the dumping of steel in the united states have totally revived our steel industry new and expanded plants are happening all over the us we have not only saved this important industry but created many jobs also billions paid to our treasury a big win for us never thought i'd say this but i think  and   have even less understanding of the wall negotiations than the folks at fake news cnn  nbc look to final results don't know how my poll numbers are so good especially up 19percent with hispanics after all that i have done for the military our great veterans judges 99 justices 2 tax  regulation cuts the economy energy trade  much more does anybody really think i won't build the wall done more in first two years than any president make america great again never thought i'd say this but i think  and   have even less understanding of the wall negotiations than the folks at fake news cnn  nbc look to final results don't know how my poll numbers are so good especially up 19percent with hispanics build a wall  crime will fall    thank you to brit this is a very big deal in europe fake news is the enemy of the people  jens stoltenberg nato secretary general just stated that because of me nato has been able to raise far more money than ever before from its members after many years of decline it's called burden sharing also more united dems  fake news like to portray the opposite we are not even into february and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18959495168 cost friday was $603331392 there are at least 25772342 illegal aliens not the 11000000 that have been reported for years in our country so ridiculous dhs 58000 non-citizens voted in texas with 95000 non-citizens registered to vote these numbers are just the tip of the iceberg all over the country especially in california voter fraud is rampant must be stopped strong voter id  rt  strong people stand up for themselvesbut stronger people stand up for othersthank you president  for stan witch hunt about all of the one sided fake media coverage collusion with crooked h that i had to endure during my very successful presidential campaign what about the now revealed bias by facebook and many others roger stone didn't even work for me anywhere near the election cbs reports that in the roger stone indictment data was released during the 2016 election to damage hillary clinton oh really what about the fake and unverified dossier a total phony conjob that was paid for by crooked hillary to damage me and the trump campaign what ax falls quickly at buzzfeed and huffpost headline new york post fake news and bad journalism have caused a big downturn sadly many others will follow the people want the truth only fools or people with a political agenda don't want a wall or steel barrier to protect our country from crime drugs and human trafficking it will happen it always does build a wall  crime will fall  we absolutely need a physical barrier or wall whatever you want to call it the president yesterday laid all that out we need to do it all including the wall i provided the same information to the previous administration  it was ignored mark morgan border chief for o thank you to the republican national committee the rnc who voted unanimously yesterday to support me in the upcoming 2020 election considering that we have done more than any administration in the first two years this should be easy more great things now in the works we have turned away at great expense two major caravans but a big one has now formed and is coming at least 8000 people if we had a powerful wall they wouldn't even try to make the long and dangerous journey build the wall and crime will fall 21 days goes very quickly negotiations with democrats will start immediately will not be easy to make a deal both parties very dug in the case for national security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the border  through dialogue we will build the wall i like the fact that the president is making the case border security  crime to the american people now we know where nancy pelosi chuck schumer  the democrats stand which is no border security will be big 2020 issue matt schlapp chair acu bigger than anyone knows if roger stone was indicted for lying to congress what about the lying done by comey brennan clapper lisa page  lover baker and soooo many others what about hillary to fbi and her 33000 deleted emails what about lisa  peter's deleted texts  wiener's laptop much more i wish people would read or listen to my words on the border wall this was in no way a concession it was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days if no deal is done it's off to the races greatest witch hunt in the history of our country no collusion border coyotes drug dealers and human traffickers are treated better who alerted cnn to be there a third rate conman who interviewed me many years ago for just a short period of time has been playing his biggest con of all on fake news cnn michael d'antonio a broken down hack who knows nothing about me goes on night after night telling made up trump stories disgraceful great earnings coming out of stock market too bad media doesn't devote much time to this nancy just said she just doesn't understand why very simply without a wall it all doesn't work our country has a chance to greatly reduce crime human trafficking gangs and drugs should have been done for decades we will not cave without a wall there cannot be safety and security at the border or for the usa build the wall and crime will fall back home where they belong no more rockets or m's being fired over japan or anywhere else and most importantly no nuclear testing this is more than has ever been accomplished with north korea and the fake news knows it i expect another good meeting soon much potential the fake news media loves saying so little happened at my first summit with kim jong un wrong after 40 years of doing nothing with north korea but being taken to the cleaners  with a major war ready to start in a short 15 months relationships built hostages  remains so interesting that bad lawyer michael cohen who sadly will not be testifying before congress is using the lawyer of crooked hillary clinton to represent him gee how did that happen remember july 4th weekend when crooked went before fbi  wasn't sworn in no tape nothing the economy is doing great more people working in usa today than at any time in our history media barely covers  this is everything fdr dreamed about the new deal to put america back to work think of lbj he gave people food stamps  welfare donald trump's giving them a job he's got a lot of good things to talk about news stories do not accurately cover him should correct  a great new book just out game of thorns by doug wead presidential historian and best selling author the book covers the campaign of 2016 and what could be more exciting than that alternative venue for the sotu address because there is no venue that can compete with the history tradition and importance of the house chamber i look forward to giving a great state of the union address in the near future as the shutdown was going on nancy pelosi asked me to give the state of the union address i agreed she then changed her mind because of the shutdown suggesting a later date this is her prerogative i will do the address when the shutdown is over i am not looking for an the historic results of president donald j trump's first two years in office  even trump haters like msnbc acknowledge you build a wall  crime will fall  the citizens of venezuela have suffered for too long at the hands of the illegitimate maduro regime today i have officially recognized the president of the venezuelan national assembly juan guaido as the interim president of venezuela  build a wall  crime will fall build a wall  crime will fall this is the new theme for two years until the wall is finished under construction now of the republican party use it and pray great unity in the republican party want to once and for all put an end to stoppable crime and drugs border security and wall no doubt deroy murdock national review we are now exporting oil which is the first time in my lifetime we are right now the largest producer of oil and gas this is not good if you're vladimir putin where your chief export is oil wh agent not good for kremlin  congratulations to mariano rivera on unanimously being elected to the national baseball hall of fame not only a great player but a great person i am thankful for mariano's support of the opioid drug abuse commission and   💯  big crooked hillary law firm represented by her lawyer michael sussmann do you believe this who worked baker hard  gave him oppo research for a russia probe this meeting now exposed is the subject of senate inquiries and much more an unconstitutional hoax  former fbi top lawyer james baker just admitted involvement in fisa warrant and further admitted there  were irregularities in the way the russia probe was handled they relied heavily on the unverified trump dossier paid for by the dnc  clinton campaign  funded through a the reason sarah sanders does not go to the podium much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely  inaccurately in particular certain members of the press i told her not to bother the word gets out anyway most will never cover us fairly  hence the term fake news the united states has a great economic story to tell number one in the world by far last time i went to davos the fake news said i should not go there this year because of the shutdown i decided not to go and the fake news said i should be there the fact is that the people understand the media better than the media understands them never seen  and republicans so united on an issue as they are on the humanitarian crisis  security on our southern border if we create a wall or barrier which prevents criminals and drugs from flowing into our country crime will go down by record numbers marist/npr/pbs poll shows president trump's approval rating among latinos going to 50percent an increase in one year of 19percent thank you working hard fbi top lawyer confirms unusual steps they relied on the clinton campaign's fake  unverified dossier which is illegal that has corrupted them that has enabled them to gather evidence by unconstitutional means and that's what they did to the president judge napolitano without a wall our country can never have border or national security with a powerful wall or steel barrier crime rates and drugs will go substantially down all over the us the dems know this but want to play political games must finally be done correctly no cave the democrats are playing politics with border security   nick sandmann and the students of covington have become symbols of fake news and how evil it can be they have captivated the attention of the world and i know they will use it for the good maybe even to bring people together it started off unpleasant but can end in a dream looking like nick sandman  covington catholic students were treated unfairly with early judgements proving out to be false smeared by media not good but making big comeback new footage shows that media was wrong about teen's encounter with native american  democrats are kidding themselves they don't really believe it if they say you can stop crime drugs human trafficking and caravans without a wall or steel barrier stop playing games and give america the security it deserves a humanitarian crisis four people in nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our country 26 people killed on the border in a drug and gang related fight two large caravans from honduras broke into mexico and are headed our way we need a powerful wall if nancy pelosi thinks that walls are immoral why isn't she requesting that we take down all of the existing walls between the us and mexico even the new ones just built in san diego at their very strong urging let millions of unchecked strangers just flow into the us china posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to us trade tensions and new policies makes so much sense for china to finally do a real deal and stop playing around today it was my great honor to visit the martin luther king jr memorial with  mike pence in honor of   democrats campaigned on working within washington and getting things done how is that working out  today we celebrate dr martin luther king jr for standing up for the self-evident truth americans hold so dear that no matter what the color of our skin or the place of our birth we are all created equal by god   last year was the best year for american manufacturing job growth since 1997 or 21 years the previous administration said manufacturing will not come back to the us you would need a magic wand i guess i found the magic wand and it is only getting better no president in modern times has kept more promises than donald trump thank you bill bennett  curt schilling deserves to be in the baseball hall of fame great record especially when under pressure and when it mattered most do what everyone in baseball knows is right  congratulations to bob kraft bill belichick tom brady and the entire new england patriots team on a great game and season will be a fantastic super bowl to all of the great people who are working so hard for your country and not getting paid i say thank you you are great patriots we must now work together after decades of abuse to finally fix the humanitarian criminal  drug crisis at our border we will win big a truly great first lady who doesn't get the credit she deserves  thanks james  will do a fantastic job  the media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with north korea think of where we were at the end of the obama administration compared to now great meeting this week with top reps looking forward to meeting with chairman kim at end of february thank you david  don't forget we are building and renovating big sections of wall right now moving quickly and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible building after all is what i do best even when money is not readily available wow just heard that my poll numbers with hispanics has gone up 19percent to 50percent that is because they know the border issue better than anyone and they want security which can only be gotten with a wall nancy i am still thinking about the state of the union speech there are so many options including doing it as per your written offer made during the shutdown security is no problem and my written acceptance while a contract is a contract i'll get back to you soon nancy pelosi has behaved so irrationally  has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a radical democrat she is so petrified of the lefties in her party that she has lost controland by the way clean up the streets in san francisco they are disgusting no amnesty is not a part of my offer it is a 3 year extension of daca amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal whether on immigration or something else likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11000000 plus people who are here illegally-but be careful nancy nancy pelosi and some of the democrats turned down my offer yesterday before i even got up to speak they don't see crime  drugs they only see 2020 which they are not going to win best economy they should do the right thing for the country  allow people to go back to work be careful and try staying in your house large parts of the country are suffering from  tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold amazing how big this system is wouldn't be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned global warming right now always heard that as president it's all about the economy well we have one of the best economies in the history of our country big gdp lowest unemployment companies coming back to the us in big numbers great new trade deals happening  more but little media mention i will be live from the white house at 4:00 pm mexico is doing nothing to stop the caravan which is now fully formed and heading to the united states we stopped the last two many are still in mexico but can't get through our wall but it takes a lot of border agents if there is no wall not easy many people are saying that the mainstream media will have a very hard time restoring credibility because of the way they have treated me over the past 3 years including the election lead-up as highlighted by the disgraceful buzzfeed story  the even more disgraceful coverage the economy is one of the best in our history with unemployment at a 50 year low and the stock market ready to again break a record set by us many times  all you heard yesterday

because president trump has deregulated energy and we are now  producing a great deal more oil than ever before   but this is bad news for russia why would president trump do such a thing thought he worked for kremlin border is eventually going to be militarized and defended or the united states as we have known it is going to cease to existand americans will not go gentle into that good night patrick buchanan  the great people of our country demand proper border security now the trump portrait of an unsustainable border crisis is dead on in the last two years ice officers made 266000

commercial from bighorn or wounded knee instead of her kitchen with her husband dressed in full indian garb it would have been a smash  so sorry to hear the news about jeff bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting i understand is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper the amazon washington post hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better  more responsible hands likewise do not want the kurds to provoke turkey russia iran and syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term us policy of destroying isis in syria natural enemies we also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home stop the endless wars starting the long overdue pullout from syria while hitting the little remaining isis territorial caliphate hard and from many directions will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms will devastate turkey economically if they hit kurds create 20 mile safe zone wish i could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the white house and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and rose garden really is something special country special place thousands of illegal aliens who have committed sexual crimes against children are right now in texas prisons most came through our southern border we can end this easily we need a steel barrier or wall walls work john jones texas department of public safety   the damage done to our country from a badly broken border drugs crime and so much that is bad is far greater than a shutdown which the dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to washington i'm in the white house waiting the democrats are everywhere but washington as people await their pay they are having fun and not even talking the building of the wall on the southern border will bring down the crime rate throughout the entire country democrats are saying that daca is not worth it and don't want to include in talks many hispanics will be coming over to the republican side watch i will be interviewed by jeanine pirro at 9:00 pm on  watch  before and  after all terrific people i am in the white house waiting for cryin' chuck and nancy to call so we can start helping our country both at the border and from within we have a massive humanitarian crisis at our southern border we will be out for a long time unless the democrats come back from their vacations and get back to work i am in the white house ready to sign i do have a plan on the shutdown but to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that i won the election and i promised safety and security for the american people part of that promise was a wall at the southern border elections have consequences i just watched a fake reporter from the amazon washington post say the white house is chaotic there does not seem to be a strategy for this shutdown there is no plan the fakes always like talking chaos there is none in fact there's almost nobody in the wh but me and democrats could solve the shutdown in 15 minutes call your dem senator or congresswoman/man tell them to get it done humanitarian crisis 23percent of federal inmates are illegal immigrants border arrests are up 240percent in the great state of texas between 2011  2018 there were a total of 292000 crimes by illegal aliens 539 murders 32000 assaults 3426 sexual assaults and 3000 weapons charges democrats come

lyin' james comey andrew mccabe peter s and his lover agent lisa page  more all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act these are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your president part of the witch hunt remember the insurance policy this is it i have been far tougher on russia than obama bush or clinton maybe tougher than any other president at the same time  as i have often said getting along with russia is a good thing not a bad thing i fully expect that someday we will have good relations with russia again who is being totally protected by his best friend bob mueller  the 13 angry democrats leaking machines who have no interest in going after the real collusion and much more by crooked hillary clinton her campaign and the democratic national committee just watch the fbi was in complete turmoil see ny post because of comey's poor leadership and the way he handled the clinton mess not to mention his usurpation of powers from the justice department my firing of james comey was a great day for america he was a crooked cop funny thing about james comey everybody wanted him fired republican and democrat alike after the rigged  botched crooked hillary investigation where she was interviewed on july 4th weekend not recorded or sworn in and where she said she didn't know anything a lie wow just learned in the failing new york times that the corrupt former leaders of the fbi almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons opened up an investigation on me for no reason  with no proof after i fired lyin' james comey a total sleaze  called a san diego news station  for negative reports on the wall when the station said that walls work cnn no longer had interest   drug prices declined in 2018 the first time in nearly half a century during the first 19 months of my administration americans saved $26 billion on prescription drugs our policies to get cheaper generic drugs to market are working i look forward to hosting right out of the great state of south carolina the 2019 ncaa football champion clemson tigers at the white house on monday january 14th what a game what a coach what a team the fake news media keeps saying we haven't built any new wall below is a section just completed on the border anti-climbing feature included very high strong and beautiful also many miles already renovated and in service  the steel barrier or wall should have been built by previous administrations long ago they never got it done i will without it our country cannot be safe criminals gangs human traffickers drugs  so much other big trouble can easily pour in it can be stopped cold humanitarian crisis at our southern border i just got back and it is a far worse situation than almost anyone would understand an invasion i have been there numerous times the democrats cryin' chuck and nancy don't know how bad and dangerous it is for our entire country h1-b holders in the united states can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay including a potential path to citizenship we want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the us i often said during rallies with little variation that mexico will pay for the wall we have just signed a great new trade deal with mexico it is billions of dollars a year better than the very bad nafta deal which it replaces the difference pays for wall many times over when i took the oath of office  we lose 300 americans a week 90percent of which comes through the southern border these numbers will be drastically reduced if we have a wall will be interviewed at the border by  on  tonight at 9:00 enjoy dear diary  from the southern border  because of the democrats intransigence on border security and the great importance of safety for our nation i am respectfully cancelling my very important trip to davos switzerland for the world economic forum my warmest regards and apologies to the  president obama thank you for your great support  i have been saying this all along  make america great again getting ready to leave for the great state of texas  great support for border security and the wall   even greater than anyone would know presidents supporters do not want him to cave  i won't there is great unity with the republicans in the house and senate despite the fake news media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise the opposition party  the dems know we must have strong border security but don't want to give trump another one of many wins cryin chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that i slammed the table  walked out of the room he had a temper tantrum because i knew he would say that and after nancy said no to proper border security i politely said bye-bye and left no slamming rt  just received my newest voter score tracking from my team  has reached his highest national approval rating gave an off the record luncheon somewhat of a white house tradition or custom to network anchors yesterday and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media which has gone totally bonkers the mainstream media has never been more dishonest than it is now nbc and msnbc are going crazy they report stories purposely the exact opposite of the facts they are truly the opposition party working with the dems may even be worse than fake news cnn if that is possible just left a meeting with chuck and nancy a total waste of time i asked what is going to happen in 30 days if i quickly open things up are you going to approve border security which includes a wall or steel barrier nancy said no i said bye-bye nothing else works thank you to all of america's brave police deputies sheriffs and federal law enforcement on national law enforcement appreciation day we love you and will always support you  billions of dollars are sent to the state of california for forest fires that with proper forest management would never happen unless they get their act together which is unlikely i have ordered fema to send no more money it is a disgraceful

 gdp are strong tax  reg cuts historic trade deals great but we must fix our southern border thank you for soooo many nice comments regarding my oval office speech a very interesting experience billions of dollars are sent to the state of california for forrest fires that with proper forrest management would never happen unless they get their act together which is unlikely i have ordered fema to send no more money it is a disgraceful situation in lives  money congratulations to a truly great football team the clemson tigers on an incredible win last night against a powerful alabama team a big win also for the great state of south carolina look forward to seeing the team and their brilliant coach for the second time at the wh talks with china are going very well the president is the biggest and best supporter of the steel industry in many years we are now doing really well the tariffs let us compete was unfair that the steel industry lost its jobs to unfair trade laws very positive outcome mark glyptis united steelworkers economic numbers looking really good can you imagine if i had long term zero interest rates to play with like the past administration rather than the rapidly raised normalized rates we have today that would have been so easy still markets up big since 2016 election endless wars especially those which are fought out of judgement mistakes that were made many years ago  those where we are getting little financial or military help from the rich countries that so greatly benefit from what we are doing will eventually come to a glorious end i am pleased to inform you that i will address the nation on the humanitarian and national security crisis on our southern border tuesday night at 9:00 pm eastern the failing new york times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on syria no different from my original statements we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight isis and doing all else that is prudent and necessary congressman adam smith the new chairman of the house armed services committee just stated yes there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency it's been done a number of times no doubt but let's get our deal done in congress the fake news media in our country is the real opposition party it is truly the enemy of the people we must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting the fake news will knowingly lie and demean in order make the tremendous success of the trump administration and me look as bad as possible they use non-existent sources  write stories that are total fiction our country is doing so well yet this is a sad day in america with all of the success that our country is having including the just released jobs numbers which are off the charts the fake news  totally dishonest media concerning me and my presidency has never been worse many have become crazed lunatics who have given up on the truth vp mike pence and group had a productive meeting with the schumer/pelosi representatives today many details of border security were discussed we are now planning a steel barrier rather than concrete it is both stronger  less obtrusive good solution and made in the usa our great military has delivered justice for the heroes lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the uss cole we have just killed the leader of that attack jamal al-badawi our work against al qaeda continues we will never stop in our fight against radical islamic terrorism excited to see our friends in egypt opening the biggest cathedral in the middle east president el-sisi is moving his country to a more inclusive future the only reason they do not want to build a wall is that walls work 99percent of our illegal border crossings will end crime in our country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year a properly planned and constructed wall will pay for itself many times a year we simply cannot allow people to pour into the united states undetected undocumented unchecked barrack obama 2005 i voted when i was a senator to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in hillary clinton 2015 will be going to camp david tomorrow morning for meetings on border security and many other topics with  senior staff ap-norc poll immigration among the top concerns in 2019 people want to stop drugs and criminals at the border want border security tell the dems to do the inevitable now rather than later the wait is costly and dangerous the number of employed americans has now set a 14th record under president trump over the year average hourly earnings have increased by 84 cents or 32percent participation rate hits trump-era high cns news  and we will do even better with new trade deals and all else jobs up big plus 312000 record number working manufacturing best in 20 years previous administration said this could not happen hispanic unemployment lowest ever dow plus 747 for day  vp mike pence and team just left the white house briefed me on their meeting with the schumer/pelosi representatives not much headway made today second meeting set for tomorrow after so many decades must finally and permanently fix the problems on the southern border drug makers and companies are not living up to their commitments on pricing not being fair to the consumer or to our country former  editor jill abramson rips paper's ‘unmistakably anti-trump' biasms abramson is 100percent correct horrible and totally dishonest reporting on almost everything they write hence the term fake news enemy of the people and opposition party great tweet today by tyler q houlton  on the  being put out by  a proud member of the opposition party  is doing a great job the democrats want billions of dollars for foreign aid but they don't want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our border figure that one out we are working hard at the border but we need a wall  in 2018 17 million pounds of narcotics seized 17000 adults arrested with criminal records and 6000 gang members including ms-13 apprehended a big human trafficking problem i don't care that most of the workers not getting paid are democrats i want to stop the shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on strong border security i am in the white house ready to go where are the dems many people currently a part of my opposition including president obama  the dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money these are civil cases they paid a fine  settled while no big deal i did not commit a campaign violation the democrats could solve the shutdown problem in a very short period of time all they have to do is approve real border security including a wall something which everyone other than drug dealers human traffickers and criminals want very badly this would be so easy to do great support coming from all sides for border security including wall on our very dangerous southern border teams negotiating this weekend washington post and nbc reporting of events including fake sources has been very inaccurate to put it mildly thank you to kanye west for your nice words criminal justice reform is now law passed in a very bipartisan way great new book by dr robert jeffress choosing the extraordinary life get it and enjoy   the story in the new york times regarding jim webb being considered as the next secretary of defense is fake news i'm sure he is a fine man but i don't know jim and never met him patrick shanahan who is acting secretary of defense is doing a great job job growth surges by 312000 in december  great jobs numbers just announced how do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time done nothing wrong no collusion with russia it was the dems that colluded had the most successful first two years of any president and is the most popular republican in party history 93percent as i have stated many times if the democrats take over the house or senate there will be disruption to the financial markets we won the senate they won the house things will settle down they only want to impeach me because they know they can't win in 2020 too much success president trump deserves a lot of credit but again you have the anti-trump people who are not going to give him a lot of credit michael pillsbury interviewed by  they have the motive of making the president look bad  instead of president trump being portrayed as a hero the first president to take china on it's 20 years overdue the rnc has a great chairwoman in ronna mcdaniel and the  has never been stronger we achieved historic wins with her help last year 🇺🇸 the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on at some point this had to be done the shutdown is only because of the 2020 presidential election the democrats know they can't win based on all of the achievements of trump so they are going all out on the desperately needed wall and border security and presidential harassment for them strictly politics maga list 205 ‘historic results' help trump make case for 2020 re-election  sadly there can be no real border security without the wall i remain ready and willing to work with democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders supports the agents and officers on the ground and keeps america safe let's get it done important meeting today on border security with republican and democrat leaders in congress both parties must work together to pass a funding bill that protects this nation and its people  this is the first and most important duty of government mexico is paying for the wall through the new usmca trade deal much of the wall has already been fully renovated or built we have done a lot of work $56 billion dollars that house has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of national security quick payback here we go with mitt romney but so fast question will be is he a flake  i hope not would much prefer that mitt focus on border security and so many other things where he can be helpful i won big and he didn't he should be happy for all republicans be a team player  win for far too long senate democrats have been obstructing more than 350 nominations these great americans left their jobs to serve our country but can't because dems are blocking them some for two years-historic record passed committees but schumer putting them on hold bad do you think it's just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut kim jong un says north korea will not make or test nuclear weapons or give them to others  he is ready to meet president trump anytime pbs news hour i also look forward to meeting with chairman kim who realizes so well that north korea possesses great economic potential washington examiner maga list 205 ‘historic results' help trump make case for 2020 re-election  true gas prices are low and expected to go down this year this would be good border security and the wall thing and shutdown is not where nancy pelosi wanted to start her tenure as speaker let's make a deal congratulations to president  who just made a great inauguration speech the usa is with you one thing has now been proven the democrats do not care about open borders and all of the crime and drugs that open borders bring general mcchrystal got fired like a dog by obama last assignment a total bust known for big dumb mouth hillary lover  the democrats much as i suspected have allocated no money for a new wall so imaginative the problem is without a wall there can be no real border security and our country must finally have a strong and secure southern border happy new year happy new year to everyone including the haters and the fake news media 2019 will be a fantastic year for those not suffering from trump derangement syndrome just calm down and enjoy the ride great things are happening for our country dr sebastian gorka a very good and talented guy has a great new book just out why we fight lots of insight enjoy remember this throughout the ages some things never get better and never change you have walls and you have wheels it was always that way and it will always be that way please explain to the democrats that there can never be a replacement for a good old fashioned wall the democrats will probably submit a bill being cute as always which gives everything away but gives nothing to border security namely the wall you see without the wall there can be no border security the tech stuff is just by comparison meaningless bells  whistles mexico is paying for the wall through the many billions of dollars a year that the usa is saving through the new trade deal the usmca that will replace the horrendous nafta trade deal which has so badly hurt our country mexico  canada will also thrive good for all happy new year  senator schumer more than a year longer than any other administration in history these are people who have been approved by committees and all others yet schumer continues to hold them back from serving their country very unfair heads of countries are calling wanting to know why senator schumer is not approving their otherwise approved ambassadors likewise in government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace 360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from it's incredible how democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a wall doesn't work it does and properly built almost 100percent they say it's old technology but so is the wheel they now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying i'm in the oval office democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security including the wall you voted yes in 2006 and 2013 one more yes but with me in office i'll get it built and fast i am the only person in america who could say that i'm bringing our great troops back home with victory and get bad press it is fake news and pundits who have failed for years that are doing the complaining if i stayed in endless wars forever they would still be unhappy i campaigned on border security which you cannot have without a strong and powerful wall our southern border has long been an open wound where drugs criminals including human traffickers and illegals would pour into our country dems should get back here an fix now except the results are far better than i ever said they were going to be i campaigned against the never ending wars remember i campaigned on getting out of syria and other places now when i start getting out the fake news media or some failed generals who were unable to do the job before i arrived like to complain about me  my tactics which are working just doing what i said i was going to do if anybody but donald trump did what i did in syria which was an isis loaded mess when i became president they would be a national hero isis is mostly gone we're slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families while at the same time fighting isis remnants an all concrete wall was never abandoned as has been reported by the media some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides makes sense to me i'm in the oval office democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security including the wall you voted yes in 2006 and 3013 one more yes but with me in office i'll get it built and fast president and mrs obama built/has a ten foot wall around their dc mansion/compound i agree totally necessary for their safety and security the us needs the same thing slightly larger version great work by my administration over the holidays to save coast guard pay during this  no thanks to the democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of americans veterans on president trump's handling of border security 62percent approval rating on being a strong leader 59percent  ap poll thank you it turns out to be true now that the department of justice and the fbi under president obama rigged the investigation for hillary and really turned the screws on trump and now it looks like in a corrupt  illegal way the facts are out now whole hoax exposed  absolutely nothing on russian collusion kimberley strassel the wall street journal the russian collusion fabrication is the greatest hoax in the history of american politics the only russian collusion was with hillary and the democrats 2018 is being called the year of the worker by steve moore co-author of trumponomics it was indeed a great year for the american worker with the best job market in 50 years and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and hispanics and all workers big wage gains for those that naively ask why didn't the republicans get approval to build the wall over the last year it is because in the senate we need 10 democrat votes and they will gives us none for border security now we have to do it the hard way with a shutdown too bad  children in question were very sick before they were given over to border patrol the father of the young girl said it was not their fault he hadn't given her water in days border patrol needs the wall and it will all end they are working so hard  getting so little credit any deaths of children or others at the border are strictly the fault of the democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally they can't if we had a wall they wouldn't even try the two just had a long and very good call with president xi of china deal is moving along very well if made it will be very comprehensive covering all subjects areas and points of dispute big progress being made i am in the white house waiting for the democrats to come on over and make a deal on border security from what i hear they are spending so much time on presidential harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military the mueller angry democrats recently deleted approximately 19000 text messages between fbi agent lisa page and her lover agent peter s these texts were asked for and invaluable to the truth of the witch hunt hoax this is a total obstruction of justice all texts demanded thank you to sean parnell for the nice comments on  about the troops wonderful reaction to melania and i in iraq and germany great things are happening honduras guatemala and el salvador are doing nothing for the united states but taking our money word is that a new caravan is forming in honduras and they are doing nothing about it we will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries taking advantage of us for years close the southern border bring our car industry back into the united states where it belongs go back to pre-nafta before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to mexico either we build finish the wall or we close the border the united states looses soooo much money on trade with mexico under nafta over 75 billion dollars a year not including drug money which would be many times that amount that i would consider closing the southern border a profit making operation we build a wall or we will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall  also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with hard to believe there was a congress  president who would approve cnn  others within the fake news universe were going wild about my signing maga hats for our military in iraq and germany if these brave young people ask me to sign their hat i will sign can you imagine my saying no we brought or gave no hats as the fake news first reported this isn't about the wall everybody knows that a wall will work perfectly in israel the wall works 999percent this is only about the dems not letting donald trump  the republicans have a win they may have the 10 senate votes but we have the issue border security 2020 brad blakeman the american people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them the president says look this is your neighborhood you've got to stand up to protect yourselves don't always look to america i totally agree  there is right now a full scale manhunt going on in california for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop time to get tough on border security build the wall border patrol agents want the wall democrat's say they don't want the wall even though they know it is really needed and they don't want ice they don't have much to campaign on do they an open southern border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity the reason the daca for wall deal didn't get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th circuit allowed daca to remain thereby setting up a supreme court case after ruling dems dropped deal and that's where we are today democrat obstruction of the needed wall the democrats obstruction of the desperately needed wall where they almost all recently agreed it should be built is exceeded only by their obstruction of 350 great people wanting  expecting to come into government after being delayed for more than two years a us record have the democrats finally realized that we desperately need border security and a wall on the southern border need to stop drugs human traffickinggang members  criminals from coming into our country do the dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are democrats just returned from visiting our troops in iraq and germany one thing is certain we have incredible people representing our country people that know how to win brad blakeman the american people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them the pesident says look this is your neighborhood you've got to stand up to protect yourselves don't always look to america the reason the daca for wall deal didn't get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th circuit allowed daca to remain thereby setting up a supteme court case after ruling dems dropped deal and that's where we are today democrat obstruction of the needed wall  melania and i were honored to visit our incredible troops at al asad air base in iraq god bless the usa  i hope everyone even the fake news media is having a great christmas our country is doing very well we are securing our borders making great new trade deals and bringing our troops back home we are finally putting america first merry christmas   merry christmas i am in the oval office  just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the wall in texas we are already building and renovating many miles of wall some complete democrats must end shutdown and finish funding billions of dollars  lives will be saved christmas eve briefing with my team working on north korea  progress being made looking forward to my next summit with chairman kim  i am all alone poor me in the white house waiting for the democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed border security at some point the democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our country more money than the border wall we are all talking about crazy saudi arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild syria instead of the united states see isn't it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a great country the us that is 5000 miles away thanks to saudi a the wall is different than the 25 billion dollars in border security the complete wall will be built with the shutdown money plus funds already in hand the reporting has been inaccurate on the point the problem is without the wall much of the rest of dollars are wasted i never lashed out at the acting attorney general of the us a man for whom i have great respect this is a made up story one of many by the fake news media the only problem our economy has is the fed they don't have a feel for the market they don't understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars or even democrat shutdowns over borders the fed is like a powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch he can't putt america is respected again for all of the sympathizers out there of brett mcgurk remember he was the obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 18 billion dollars in cash   sending it to iran as part of the horrific iran nuclear deal now terminated approved by little bob corker we are substantially subsidizing the militaries of many very rich countries all over the world while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the us and our taxpayers on trade general mattis did not see this as a problem i do and it is being fixed to those few senators who think i don't like or appreciate being allied with other countries they are wrong i do what i don't like however is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the united states both in military protection and trade virtually every democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a border wall or fence it was only when i made it an important part of my campaign because people and drugs were pouring into our country unchecked that they turned against it desperately needed president  of turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of isis in syriaand he is a man who can do it plus turkey is right next door our troops are coming home the president has been remarkable i do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is thank you to tammy bruce and steve hilton presidential harassment has been with me from the beginning the most important way to stop gangs drugs human trafficking and massive crime is at our southern border we need border security and as everyone knows you can't have border security without a wall the drones  technology are just bells and whistles safety for america mitch mcconnell just told a group of people and me that he has been in the us senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best  most productive of his career tax  regulation cuts va choice farm bill criminal justice reform judgeships  much more great it should not be the job of america to replace regimes around the world this is what president trump recognized in iraq that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades and he's rightthe generals still don't get the mistake   thanks   i am very proud of the president this is exactly what he promised and i think the people agree with him we've been at war too long and in too many placesspent several trillion dollars on these wars everywhere he's differentthat's why he got elected bob corker was responsible for giving us the horrible iran nuclear deal which i ended yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement i said no and the game was over  i love tennessee senator bob corker just stated that i'm so priveledged to serve in the senate for twelve years and that's what i told the people of our state that's what i'd do serve for two terms but that is not true wanted to run but poll numbers tanked when i wouldn't endorse him we signed two pieces of major legislation this week criminal justice reform and the farm bill these are two big deals but all the fake news media wants to talk about is the mistake of bringing our young people back home from the never ending wars it all began 19 years ago unthinkable devastation from the tsunami disaster in indonesia more than two hundred dead and nearly a thousand injured or unaccounted for we are praying for recovery and healing america is with you i just had a long and productive call with president  of turkey we discussed isis our mutual involvement in syria  the slow  highly coordinated pullout of us troops from the area after many years they are coming home we also discussed heavily expanded trade i am pleased to announce that our very talented deputy secretary of defense patrick shanahan will assume the title of acting secretary of defense starting january 1 2019 patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as deputy  previously boeing he will be great the only way to stop drugs gangs human trafficking criminal elements and much else from coming into our country is with a wall or barrier drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun but it is only a good old fashioned wall that works when president obama ingloriously fired jim mattis i gave him a second chance some thought i shouldn't i thought i should interesting relationship-but i also gave all of the resources that he never really had allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of us if anybody but your favorite president donald j trump announced that after decimating isis in syria we were going to bring our troops back home happy  healthy that person would be the most popular hero in america with me hit hard instead by the fake news media crazy brett mcgurk who i do not know was appointed by president obama in 2015 was supposed to leave in february but he just resigned prior to leaving grandstander the fake news is making such a big deal about this nothing event i will not be going to florida because of the shutdown staying in the white house   senate adjourns until december 27th i won an election said to be one of the greatest of all time based on getting out of endless  costly foreign wars  also based on strong borders which will keep our country safe we fight for the borders of other countries but we won't fight for the borders of our own the crisis of illegal activity at our southern border is real and will not stop until we build a great steel barrier or wall let work begin will be having lunch in white house residence with large group concerning border security going to be there for three months and that was seven years ago we never left when i became president isis was going wild now isis is largely defeated and other local countries including turkey should be able to easily take care of whatever remains we're coming home i am in the white house working hard news reports concerning the shutdown and syria are mostly fake we are negotiating with the democrats on desperately needed border security gangs drugs human trafficking  more but it could be a long stay on syria we were originally our great country must have border security  wishing supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg a full and speedy recovery some of the many bills that i am signing in the oval office right now cancelled my trip on air force one to florida while we wait to see if the democrats will help us to protect america's southern border  a design of our steel slat barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautiful  today it was my honor to sign into law hr 7213 the countering weapons of mass destruction act of 2018 the act redesignates the  domestic nuclear detection office as the countering weapons of mass destruction office read more   today it was my great honor to sign the  a monumental bi-partisan win for the american people  i've done more damage to isis than all recent presidentsnot even close the democrats now own the shutdown general anthony tata author dark winter i think the president is making the exact right move in syria all the geniuses who are protesting the withdrawal of troops from syria are the same geniuses who cooked the books on isis intelligence and gave rise to isis there has never been a president who has been tougher but fair on china or russia never just look at the facts the fake news tries so hard to paint the opposite picture thank you  for being willing to go with the so-called nuclear option in order to win on desperately needed border security have my total support mitch use the nuclear option and get it done our country is counting on you even president ronald reagan tried for 8 years to build a border wall or fence and was unable to do so others also have tried we will get it done one way or the other shutdown today if democrats do not vote for border security house republican vote 217-185 the democrats whose votes we need in the senate will probably vote against border security and the wall even though they know it is desperately needed if the dems vote no there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time people don't want open borders and crime no matter what happens today in the senate republican house members should be very proud of themselves they flew back to washington from all parts of the world in order to vote for border security and the wall not one democrat voted yes and we won big i am very proud of you on a border is only effective in conjunction with a wall properly designed and built walls work and the democrats are lying when they say they don't in israel the wall is 999percent successful will not be any different on our southern border hundreds of $billions saved the democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a wall calling it old fashioned the fact is there is nothing else's that will work and that has been true for thousands of years it's like the wheel there is nothing better i know tech better than anyone  technology senator mitch mcconnell should fight for the wall and border security as hard as he fought for anything he will need democrat votes but as shown in the house good things happen if enough dems don't vote it will be a democrat shutdown house republicans were great yesterday soon to be speaker nancy pelosi said last week live from the oval office that the republicans didn't have the votes for border security today the house republicans voted and won 217-185 nancy does not have to apologize all i want is great border security thank you to our great republican members of congress for your vote to fund border security and the wall the final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before so proud of you all now on to the senate equipment general mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations a new secretary of defense will be named shortly i greatly thank jim for his service general jim mattis will be retiring with distinction at the end of february after having served my administration as secretary of defense for the past two years during jim's tenure tremendous progress has been made especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting democrats it is time to come together and put the safety of the american people before politics border security must become a  priority  farm bill signing in 15 minutes    so hard to believe that lindsey graham would be against saving soldier lives  billions of $$$ why are we fighting for our enemy syria by staying  killing isis for them russia iran  other locals time to focus on our country  bring our youth back home where they belong congress just passed the criminal justice reform bill known as the  congratulations this is a great bi-partisan achievement for everybody when both parties work together we can keep our country safer a wonderful thing for the usa when i begrudgingly signed the omnibus bill i was promised the wall and border security by leadership would be done by end of year now it didn't happen we foolishly fight for border security for other countries but not for our beloved usa not good with so much talk about the wall people are losing sight of the great job being done on our southern border by border patrol ice and our great military remember the caravans well they didn't get through and none are forming or on their way border is tight fake news silent the democrats who know steel slats wall are necessary for border security are putting politics over country what they are just beginning to realize is that i will not sign any of their legislation including infrastructure unless it has perfect border security usa wins russia iran syria  many others are not happy about the us leaving despite what the fake news says because now they will have to fight isis and others who they hate without us i am building by far the most powerful military in the world isis hits us they are doomed does the usa want to be the policeman of the middle east getting nothing but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who in almost all cases do not appreciate what we are doing do we want to be there forever time for others to finally fight getting out of syria was no surprise i've been campaigning on it for years and six months ago when i very publicly wanted to do it i agreed to stay longer russia iran syria  others are the local enemy of isis we were doing there work time to come home  rebuild  i'm proud of the president today to hear that he is declaring victory in syria senator rand paul  i couldn't agree more with the presidents decision by definition this is the opposite of an obama decision senator mike lee trump gets no credit for what he's done in the middle east    so true thank you laura col jim carafano on  trump has made the middle east a better place when trump came into office isis was running amuck in the middle east over a million refugees poured into western europe none of that is happening today that's all due to trump after historic victories against isis it's time to bring our great young people home  in any event it goes on and on  the new ag who is now being replaced by yet another ag who openly campaigned on a get trump agenda does little else but rant rave  politic against me will never be treated fairly by these people a total double standard of justice sleazebag ag eric schneiderman who has since resigned over horrific women abuse when i wanted to close the foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics shady eric was head of new yorkers for clinton and refused to even look at the corrupt clinton foundation the trump foundation has done great work and given away lots of money both mine and others to great charities over the years with me taking no fees rent salaries etc now as usual i am getting slammed by cuomo and the dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by we have defeated isis in syria my only reason for being there during the trump presidency mexico is paying indirectly for the wall through the new usmca the replacement for nafta far more money coming to the us because of the tremendous dangers at the border including large scale criminal and drug inflow the united states military will build the wall in our country so much money has been poured down the drain for so many years but when it comes to border security and the military the democrats fight to the death we won on the military which is being completely rebuilt one way or the other we will win on the wall in our country so much money has been poured down the drain for so many years but the democrats fight us like cats and dogs when it comes to spending on boarder security including a wall and the military we won on the military it is being completely rebuilt we will win this will keep our communities safer and provide hope and a second chance to those who earn it in addition to everything else billions of dollars will be saved i look forward to signing this into law america is the greatest country in the world and my job is to fight for all citizens even those who have made mistakes congratulations to the senate on the bi-partisan passing of a historic criminal justice reform bill it will be beautiful and at the same time give our country the security that our citizens deserve it will go up fast and save us billions of dollars a month once completed the democrats are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a concrete wall but we are not building a concrete wall we are building artistically designed steel slats so that you can easily see through it congratulations to  on her appointment by governor  as the great new senator from arizona i have no doubt she will do a fantastic job president donald j trump's commission on school safety examined ways to make our schools safe for all students and teachers read more   michael isikoff was the first to report dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the dossier claims the whole russian collusion thing was a hoax but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed will never be proven and are likely false  thank you to michael isikoff yahoo for honesty what this means is that the fisa warrants and the whole russian witch hunt is a fraud and a hoax which should be ended immediately also it was paid for by crooked hillary  dnc russia dossier reporter now doubts dopey christopher steele's claims when you get into the details of the steele dossier the specific allegations we have not seen the evidence to support them there's good grounds to think that some of the more sensational allegations illegal immigration costs the united states more than 200 billion dollars a year how was this allowed to happen facebook twitter and google are so biased toward the dems it is ridiculous twitter in fact has made it much more difficult for people to join  they have removed many names  greatly slowed the level and speed of increase they have acknowledged-done nothing i hope the people over at the fed will read today's wall street journal editorial before they make yet another mistake also don't let the market become any more illiquid than it already is stop with the 50 b's feel the market don't just go by meaningless numbers good luck good luck today in court to general michael flynn will be interesting to see what he has to say despite tremendous pressure being put on him about russian collusion in our great and obviously highly successful political campaign there was no collusion biggest outrage yet in the long winding and highly conflicted mueller witch hunt is the fact that 19000 demanded text messages between peter strzok and his fbi lover lisa page were purposely  illegally deleted would have explained whole hoax which is now under protest today i am making good on my promise to defend our farmers  ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations i have authorized secretary perdue to implement the 2nd round of market facilitation payments our economy is stronger than everwe stand with our farmers anytime you hear a democrat saying that you can have good border security without a wall write them off as just another politician following the party line time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have at the same time far greater safety and control it is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation the outside world blowing up around us paris is burning and china way down the fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike take the victory the deductible which comes with obamacare is so high that it is practically not even useable hurts families badly we have a chance working with the democrats to deliver great healthcare a confirming supreme court decision will lead to great healthcare results for americans anytime you hear a democrat saying that you can have good boarder security without a wall write them off as just another politician following the party line time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have at the same time far greater safety and control the russian witch hunt hoax started as the insurance policy long before i even got elected is very bad for our country they are entrapping people for misstatements lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago nothing to do with collusion a democrat scam a persecution of the president  daniel henninger the wall street journal thank you people are starting to see and understand what this witch hunt is all about jeff sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total hoax to get started in the first place it looks here as though general flynn's defenses are incidental to something larger which is for the prosecution to figure out if it can find a path to donald trump without quite knowing what that crime might be it stops looking like prosecution and more looking like required television watching is last weeks  interview with the wonderful wife of rod blagojevich and the  interview with a jerome corsi if that doesn't tell you something about what has been going on in our country nothing will very sad the democrats policy of child seperation on the border during the obama administration was far worse than the way we handle it now remember the 2014 picture of children in cages the obama years however if you don't separate far more people will come smugglers use the kids judge ken starr former solicitor generel  independent counsel just stated that after two years there is no evidence or proof of collusion  further that there is no evidence that there was a campaign financing violation involving the president thank you judge  at the request of many i will be reviewing the case of a us military hero major matt golsteyn who is charged with murder he could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a terrorist bomb maker while overseas   remember michael cohen only became a rat after the fbi did something which was absolutely unthinkable  unheard of until the witch hunt was illegally started they broke into an attorney's office why didn't they break into the dnc to get the server or crooked's office so where are all the missing text messages between fired fbi agents peter s and the lovely lisa page his lover just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean what an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted witch hunt moves ever so slowly forward want them a real scandal is the one sided coverage hour by hour of networks like nbc  democrat spin machines like saturday night live it is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and dem commercials should be tested in courts can't be legal only defame  belittle collusion required television watching is last weeks  interview with the wonderful wife of  and the  interview with a jerome corsi if that doesn't tell you something about what has been going on in our country nothing will very sad wow 19000 texts between lisa page and her lover peter s of the fbi in charge of the russia hoax were just reported as being wiped clean and gone such a big story that will never be covered by the fake news witch hunt the pathetic and dishonest weekly standard run by failed prognosticator bill kristol who like many others never had a clue is flat broke and out of business too bad may it rest in peace never in the history of our country has the press been more dishonest than it is today stories that should be good are bad stories that should be bad are horrible many stories like with the real story on russia clinton  the dnc seldom get reported too bad the trump administration will be announcing the new secretary of the interior next week secretary of the interior  will be leaving the administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and i want to thank him for his service to our nation wow but not surprisingly obamacare was just ruled unconstitutional by a highly respected judge in texas great news for america as i predicted all along obamacare has been struck down as an unconstitutional disaster now congress must pass a strong law that provides great healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions mitch and nancy get it done for the record there were many people who wanted to be the white house chief of staff mick m will do a great job i look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to make america great again john will be staying until the end of the year he is a great patriot and i want to personally thank him for his service i am pleased to announce that mick mulvaney director of the office of management  budget will be named acting white house chief of staff replacing general john kelly who has served our country with distinction mick has done an outstanding job while in the administration thank you to  for agreeing to expand operations in the us and thereby creating thousands of jobs  kim jong un sees it better than anyone and will fully take advantage of it for his people we are doing just fine many people have asked how we are doing in our negotiations with north korea i always reply by saying we are in no hurry there is wonderful potential for great economic success for that country china just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our trade war with them they have just suspended us tariff hikes us is doing very well china wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal it could happen and rather soon china just announce the there economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our trade war with them they have just suspended us tariff hikes us is doing very well china wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal it could happen and rather soon let's not do a shutdown democrats do what's right for the american people  today it was my honor to welcome our nation's newly elected governors to the   happy 382nd birthday  our entire nation is forever grateful for all you do 24/7/365 we love you   just did an interview with  on  airing now 1pme enjoy she will probably be given a pass despite their terrible ratings congratulations to  our great ambassador to germany for having the courage to take this horrible issue on if it was a conservative that said what crazed mika brzezinski stated on her show yesterday using a certain horrible term that person would be banned permanently from television witch hunt they gave general flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated the fbi said he didn't lie and they overrode the fbi they want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements sad guilty even on a civil basis those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook as a lawyer michael has great liability to me stated that i did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws if they even apply because this was not campaign finance cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me but he plead to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not i never directed michael cohen to break the law he was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law it is called advice of counsel and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made that is why they get paid despite that many campaign finance lawyers have strongly i often stated one way or the other mexico is going to pay for the wall this has never changed our new deal with mexico and canada the usmca is so much better than the old very costly  anti-usa nafta deal that just by the money we save mexico is paying for the wall guilty even on a civil bases those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook as a lawyer michael has great liability to me  melania will be interviewed by  tonight on  at 9:00pme the democrats and president obama gave iran 150 billion dollars and got nothing but they can't give 5 billion dollars for national security and a wall another very bad terror attack in france we are going to strengthen our borders even more chuck and nancy must give us the votes to get additional border security thanks to leader mcconnell for agreeing to bring a senate vote on criminal justice this week these historic changes will make communities safer and save tremendous taxpayers dollars it brings much needed hope to many families during the holiday season i don't care what you think of the presidentit cannot bleed over to the fbicomey is confirming there is bias in the fbi -chris swecker james comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow democrats to take back the white house in 2020 in other words he is and has been a democrat comey had no right heading the fbi at any time but especially after his mind exploded fake news has it purposely wrong many over ten are vying for and wanting the white house chief of staff position why wouldn't someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in washington please report news correctly thank you very productive conversations going on with china watch for some important announcements great job by michael anton on  a true national security expert people do not yet realize how much of the wall including really effective renovation has already been built if the democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country the military will build the remaining sections of the wall they know how important it is i look forward to my meeting with chuck schumer  nancy pelosi in 2006 democrats voted for a wall and they were right to do so today they no longer want border security they will fight it at all cost and nancy must get votes for speaker but the wall will get built however for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left do not want border security they want open borders for anyone to come in this brings large scale crime and disease our southern border is now secure and will remain that way ice border patrol and our military have done a fantastic job of securing our southern border a great wall would be however a far easier  less expensive solution we have already built large new sections  fully renovated others making them like new the democrats despite the large caravans that were forming and heading to our country people have not been able to get through our newly built walls makeshift walls  fences or border patrol officers  military they are now staying in mexico or going back to their original countries former fbi director james comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the democrats paid for that phony trump dossier   details on tuesday night james comey's behind closed doors testimony reveals that there was not evidence of campaign collusion with russia when he left the fbi in other words the witch hunt is illegal and should never have been started which it was not but even if it was it is only a civil case like obama's but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine lawyer's liability if he made a mistake not me cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced witch hunt democrats can't find a smocking gun tying the trump campaign to russia after james comey's testimony no smocking gunno collusion   that's because there was no collusion so now the dems go to a simple private transaction wrongly call it a campaign contribution i am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of white house chief of staff fake news has been saying with certainty it was nick ayers a spectacular person who will always be with our  agenda i will be making a decision soon the trump administration has accomplished more than any other us administration in its first two not even years of existence  we are having a great time doing it all of this despite the fake news media which has gone totally out of its mind-truly the enemy of the people leakin' james comey must have set a record for who lied the most to congress in one day his friday testimony was so untruthful this whole deal is a rigged fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that i could not become president they are now exposed on 245  occasions former fbi director james comey told house investigators he didn't know didn't recall or couldn't remember things when asked opened investigations on 4 americans not 2 didn't know who signed off and didn't know christopher steele all lies it was my honor to attend today's  in philadelphia a great game played all around by our heroes congratulations  on the win  🇺🇸  great honor to be headed to the army-navy game today will be there shortly landing now  left and right he then woke up from his dream screaming that he lied next time i go to vietnam i will ask the dick to travel with me watched da nang dick blumenthal on television spewing facts almost as accurate as his bravery in vietnam which he never saw as the bullets whizzed by da nang dicks head as he was saving soldiers very sad day  night in paris maybe it's time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive paris agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes the us was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year this is collusion illusion there is no smoking gun here at this late date after all that we have gone through after millions have been spent we have no russian collusion there is nothing impeachable here   time for the witch hunt to end i am thankful to both of these incredible men for their service to our country date of transition to be determined i am pleased to announce my nomination of four-star general mark milley chief of staff of the united states army  as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff replacing general joe dunford who will be retiring after two years and millions of pages of documents and a cost of over $30000000 no collusion the idea of a european military didn't work out too well in ww i or 2 but the us was there for you and always will be all we ask is that you pay your fair share of nato germany is paying 1percent while the us pays 43percent of a much larger gdp to protect europe fairness the paris agreement isn't working out so well for paris protests and riots all over france people do not want to pay large sums of money much to third world countries that are questionably run in order to maybe protect the environment chanting we want trump love france totally clears the president thank you it is being reported that leakin' james comey was told by department of justice attorneys not to answer the most important questions total bias and corruption at the highest levels of previous administration force him to answer the questions under oath hopefully mitch mcconnell will ask for a vote on criminal justice reform it is extremely popular and has strong bipartisan support it will also help a lot of people save taxpayer dollars and keep our communities safe go for it mitch mike pompeo is doing a great job i am very proud of him his predecessor

years ago at pearl harbor and we salute every veteran who served in world war ii over the 4 years that followed that horrific attack god bless america   it has been incorrectly reported that rudy giuliani and others will not be doing a counter to the mueller report that is fake news already 87 pages done but obviously cannot complete until we see the final witch hunt report china talks are going very well the lying and leaking by the people doing the report  also bruce ohr and his lovely wife molly comey brennan clapper  all of the many fired people of the fbi be listed in the report will the corruption within the dnc  clinton campaign be exposedand so much more foundation be listed at the top of the report will the scathing document written about lyin' james comey by the man in charge of the case rod rosenstein who also signed the fisa warrant be a big part of the report isn't rod therefore totally conflicted will all of overturned 9-0 in the united states supreme court doing same thing to people now will all of the substantial  many contributions made by the 17 angry democrats to the campaign of crooked hillary be listed in top of report will the people that worked for the clinton will robert mueller's big time conflicts of interest be listed at the top of his republicans only report will andrew weissman's horrible and vicious prosecutorial past be listed in the report he wrongly destroyed people's lives took down great companies only to be robert mueller and leakin' lyin' james comey are best friends just one of many mueller conflicts of interest and bye the way wasn't the woman in charge of prosecuting jerome corsi who i do not know in charge of legal at the corrupt clinton foundation a total witch hunt arizona together with our military and border patrol is bracing for a massive surge at a non-walled area we will not let them through big danger nancy and chuck must approve boarder security and the wall fake news the enemy of the people trish_regan  did the fbi follow protocol to obtain the fisa warrant i don't think so the dossier was opposition research funded by opponents don't use government resources to take down political foes weaponizing government for gain is this really america witch hunt jerome corsi this is not justice this is not america this is a political prosecution the special prosecutor counsel to get this plea deal demanded i lie and violate the law they're the criminals he is not alone 17 angry dems people forced to lie sad   statement from china the teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other we are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days i agree does the fake news media ever mention the fact that republicans with the very important help of my campaign rallies won the united states senate 53 to 47 all i hear is that the open border dems won the house senate alone approves judges  others big republican win my thoughts and prayers are with the  crew members who were involved in a mid-air collision off the coast of japan thank you to  for their immediate response and rescue efforts whatever you need we are here for you  without the phony russia witch hunt and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years tax  regulation cuts judge's military vets etc my approval rating would be at 75percent rather than the 50percent just reported by rasmussen it's called presidential harassment working hard thank you  doug wead a truly great presidential historian had a wonderful take on a very beautiful moment in history the funeral service today of president bush doug was able to brilliantly cover some very important and interesting periods of time  hopefully opec will be keeping oil flows as is not restricted the world does not want to see or need higher oil prices looking forward to being with the bush family this is not a funeral this is a day of celebration for a great man who has led a long and distinguished life he will be missed considered to be the worst and most dangerous addictive and deadly substance of them all last year over 77000 people died from fentanyl if china cracks down on this horror drug using the death penalty for distributors and pushers the results will be incredible one of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with president xi of china is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly fentanyl coming into the united states it will now be considered a controlled substance this could be a game changer on what is very strong signals being sent by china once they returned home from their long trip including stops from argentina not to sound naive or anything but i believe president xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting all subjects discussed china had agreed to start immediately buying us products  china officially echoed president donald trump's optimism over bilateral trade talks chinese officials have begun preparing to restart imports of us soybeans  liquified natural gas the first sign confirming the claims of president donald trump and the white house that china does not want tariffs we are either going to have a real deal with china or no deal at all at which point we will be charging major tariffs against chinese product being shipped into the united states ultimately i believe we will be making a deal either now or into the future in the world i want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving america's environment but american taxpayers  and american workers  shouldn't pay to clean up others countries' pollution i am glad that my friend  and the protestors in paris have agreed with the conclusion i reached two years ago the paris agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters could somebody please explain to the democrats we need their votes that our country losses 250 billion dollars a year on illegal immigration not including the terrible drug flow top border security including a wall is $25 billion pays for itself in two months get it done but if a fair deal is able to be made with china one that does all of the many things we know must be finally done i will happily sign let the negotiations begin make america great again i am a tariff man when people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our nation i want them to pay for the privilege of doing so it will always be the best way to max out our economic power we are right now taking in $billions in tariffs make america rich again on seeing whether or not a real deal with china is actually possible if it is we will get it done china is supposed to start buying agricultural product and more immediately president xi and i want this deal to happen and it probably will but if not remember the negotiations with china have already started unless extended they will end 90 days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with president xi in argentina bob lighthizer will be working closely with steve mnuchin larry kudlow wilbur ross and peter navarro looking forward to being with the wonderful bush family at blair house today the former first lady will be coming over to the white house this morning to be given a tour of the christmas decorations by melania the elegance  precision of the last two days have been remarkable   congratulations to newly inaugurated mexican president  he had a tremendous political victory with the great support of the mexican people we will work well together for many years to come looking forward to being with the bush family to pay my respects to president george hw bush bob mueller who is a much different man than people think and his out of control band of angry democrats don't want the truth they only want lies the truth is very bad for their mission i will never testify against trump this statement was recently made by roger stone essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about president trump nice to know that some people still have guts his wife and father-in-law who has the money off scott free he lied for this outcome and should in my opinion serve a full and complete sentence michael cohen asks judge for no prison time you mean he can do all of the terrible unrelated to trump things having to do with fraud big loans taxis etc and not serve a long prison term he makes up stories to get a great  already reduced deal for himself and get we would save billions of dollars if the democrats would give us the votes to build the wall either way people will not be allowed into our country illegally we will close the entire southern border if necessary also stop the drugs i am certain that at some time in the future president xi and i together with president putin of russia will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable arms race the us spent 716 billion dollars this year crazy president xi and i have a very strong and personal relationship he and i are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change on trade and far beyond between our two great nations a solution for north korea is a great thing for china and all farmers will be a a very big and fast beneficiary of our deal with china they intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately we make the finest and cleanest product in the world and that is what china wants farmers i love you my meeting in argentina with president xi of china was an extraordinary one relations with china have taken a big leap forward very good things will happen we are dealing from great strength but china likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed level the field china has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into china from the us currently the tariff is 40percent this week jews around the world will celebrate the miracles of hanukkah  melania and i send our very best wishes for a blessed and happy hanukkah   however out of respect for the bush family and former president george hw bush we will wait until after the funeral to have a press conference i was very much looking forward to having a press conference just prior to leaving argentina because we have had such great success in our dealing with various countries and their leaders at the g20 president george hw bush led a long successful and beautiful life  whenever i was with him i saw his absolute joy for life and true pride in his family his accomplishments were great from beginning to end he was a truly wonderful man and will be missed by all statement from president donald j trump and first lady melania trump on the passing of former president george hw bush  watch  on  now enjoy great day at the

trained professionals who are there to help you your federal government will spare no expense god bless you all just signed one of the most important and largest trade deals in us and world history the united states mexico and canada worked so well together in crafting this great document the terrible nafta will soon be gone the usmca will be fantastic for all 🇺🇸🇲🇽🇨🇦  lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in russia put up zero money zero guarantees and didn't do the project witch hunt oh i get it i am a very good developer happily living my life when i see our country going in the wrong direction to put it mildly against all odds i decide to run for president  continue to run my business-very legal  very cool talked about it on the campaign trail arrived in argentina with a very busy two days planned important meetings scheduled throughout our great country is extremely well represented will be very productive alan dershowitz these are not crimes he mueller has no authority to be a roving commissioner i don't see any evidence of crimes  this is an illegal hoax that should be ended immediately mueller refuses to look at the real crimes on the other side where is the ig report this demonstrates the robert mueller and his partisans have no evidence not a whiff of collusion between trump and the russians russian project legal trump tower meeting son don perfectly legal he wasn't involved with hacking     gregg jarrett  a total witch hunt just landed in argentina with  melania   as rnc chair ronna mcdaniel oversaw history defying gains in the senate and unprecedented fundraising strength i have asked her to serve another term for my 2020 re-elect because there is no one better for the job we have been working hard on this and it's only going to get better  with all of the new books coming out you can't forget two of the great originals written by  and  pirro their books both went to  go get them now the phony witch hunt is well explained  new book spygate the attempted sabotage of donald j trump is terrific he's tough he's smart and he really gets it his book is on sale now i highly recommend they have really done a great job in capturing my long-held views and ideas this book is on sale now a terrific read of a really interesting subject  and arthur laffer two very talented men have just completed an incredible book on my economic policies or as they call it   has written an absolutely fascinating book back in the game on the world of dc politics and more he has experienced so much in a short period of time few people have had his bravery or courage and he has come all the way back a big power and great person in argentina with president vladimir putin i look forward to a meaningful summit again as soon as this situation is resolved based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to ukraine from russia i have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting billions of dollars are pouring into the coffers of the usa because of the tariffs being charged to china and there is a long way to go if companies don't want to pay tariffs build in the usa otherwise lets just make our country richer than ever before when will this illegal joseph mccarthy style witch hunt one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever end-or will it just go on forever after wasting more than $40000000 is that possible it has proven only one thing-there was no collusion with russia so ridiculous did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime at the same time mueller and the angry democrats aren't even looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed by crooked hillary clinton and the democrats a total disgrace general motors is very counter to what other auto and other companies are doing big steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country auto companies are pouring into the us including bmw which just announced a major new plant the usa is booming so much happening with the now discredited witch hunt this total hoax will be studied for years sebastian gorka a very talented man who i got to know well while he was working at the white house has just written an excellent book why we fight much will be learned from this very good read on behalf of  melania and the entire trump family i want to wish you all a very merry christmas may this christmas season bring peace to your hearts warmth to your homes cheer to your spirits and joy to the world 🎄  steel dynamics announced that it will build a brand new 3 million ton steel mill in the southwest that will create 600 good-paying us jobs steel jobs are coming back to america just like i predicted congratulations to steel dynamics and gm would not be closing their plants in ohio michigan  maryland get smart congress also the countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the us for decades the president has great power on this issue because of the gm event it is being studied now the reason that the small truck business in the us is such a go to favorite is that for many years tariffs of 25percent have been put on small trucks coming into our country it is called the chicken tax if we did that with cars coming in many more cars would be built here while the disgusting fake news is doing everything within their power not to report it that way at least 3 major players are intimating that the angry mueller gang of dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts  they will get relief this is our joseph mccarthy era congratulations to senator cindy hyde-smith on your big win in the great state of mississippi we are all very proud of you brenda snipes in charge of voting in broward county florida was just spotted wearing a beautiful dress with 300 i voted signs on it just kidding she is a fine very honorable and highly respected voting tactician the mueller witch hunt is a total disgrace they are looking at supposedly stolen crooked hillary clinton emails even though they don't want to look at the dnc server but have no interest in the emails that hillary deleted  acid washed after getting a congressional subpoena for electric cars general motors made a big china bet years ago when they built plants there and in mexico don't think that bet is going to pay off i am here to protect america's workers very disappointed with general motors and their ceo mary barra for closing plants in ohio michigan and maryland nothing being closed in mexico  china the us saved general motors and this is the thanks we get we are now looking at cutting all  subsidies including polls are open in mississippi we need cindy hyde-smith in washington go out and vote thanks terrible gang of angry democrats look at their past and look where they come from the now $30000000 witch hunt continues and they've got nothing but ruined lives where is the server let these terrible people go back to the clinton foundation and justice department the fake news media builds bob mueller up as a saint when in actuality he is the exact opposite he is doing tremendous damage to our criminal justice system where he is only looking at one side and not the other heroes will come of this and it won't be mueller and his the phony witch hunt continues but mueller and his gang of angry dems are only looking at one side not the other wait until it comes out how horribly  viciously they are treating people ruining lives for them refusing to lie mueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue starts today election is on december 4th  is tough on crime and borders loves our military and vets he will be great for jobs brad raffensperger will be a fantastic secretary of state for georgia will work closely with  it is really important that you get out and vote for brad early voting and false way something has to be done including the possibility of the united states starting our own worldwide network to show the world the way we really are great while cnn doesn't do great in the united states based on ratings outside of the us they have very little competition throughout the world cnn has a powerful voice portraying the united states in an unfair on the ten-year anniversary of the mumbai terror attack the us stands with the people of india in their quest for justice the attack killed 166 innocents including six americans we will never let terrorists win or even come close to winning hundreds of people closely involved with my campaign who never met saw or spoke to a russian during this period so many campaign workers people inside from the beginning ask me why they have not been called they want to be there was no collusion  mueller knows it when mueller does his final report will he be covering all of his conflicts of interest in a preamble will he be recommending action on all of the crimes of many kinds from those on the other sidewhatever happened to podesta and will he be putting in statements from mexico should move the flag waving migrants many of whom are stone cold criminals back to their countries do it by plane do it by bus do it anyway you want but they are not coming into the usa we will close the border permanently if need be congress fund the wall children from parents as did bush etc because that is the policy and law i tried to keep them together but the problem is when you do that vast numbers of additional people storm the border so with obama seperation is fine but with trump it's not fake 60 minutes  did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the obama administration in fact a picture of children in jails was used by other fake media to show how bad cruel we are but it was in 2014 during o years obama separated clinton foundation donations drop 42percent which shows that they illegally played the power game they monetized their political influence through the foundation during her tenure the state department was put in the service of the clinton foundation  andrew mccarthy europe has to pay their fair share for military protection the european union for many years has taken advantage of us on trade and then they don't live up to their military commitment through nato things must change fast general anthony tata president trump is a man of his word  he said he was going to be tough on the border and he is tough on the border he has rightfully strengthened the border in the face of an unprecedented threat it's the right move by president trump thanks general mississippi vote for  on tuesday respected by all we need her in washington thanks so great that oil prices are falling thank you president t add that which is like a big tax cut to our other good economic news inflation down are you listening fed would be very smart if mexico would stop the caravans long before they get to our southern border or if originating countries would not let them form it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in us no longer dems created this problem no crossings the large and violent french protests don't take into account how badly the united states has been treated on trade by the european union or on fair and reasonable payments for our great military protection both of these topics must be remedied soon i will be in gulfport and tupelo mississippi on monday night doing two rallies for senator hyde-smith who has a very important election on tuesday she is an outstanding person who is strong on the border crime military our great vets healthcare  the 2nd a needed in dc victor davis hanson was a very good and interesting guest of mark levin on  he wrote a highly touted book called the second world wars and a new book will soon be coming out called the case for trump recommend both  all will stay in mexico if for any reason it becomes necessary we will close our southern border there is no way that the united states will after decades of abuse put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore migrants at the southern border will not be allowed into the united states until their claims are individually approved in court we only will allow those who come into our country legally other than that our very strong policy is catch and detain no releasing into the us i am extremely happy and proud of the job being done by  secretary  the fake news likes to write stories to the contrary quoting phony sources or jealous people but they aren't true they never like to ask me for a quote b/c it would kill their story really good criminal justice reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support  mitch mcconnell and  have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country already passed with big vote in house would be a major victory for all really good criminal justice reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support  mitch mcconnell and  have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country already past with big vote in house would be a major victory for all republicans and democrats must come together finally with a major border security package which will include funding for the wall after 40 years of talk it is finally time for action fix the border for once and for all now our highly trained security professionals are not allowed to do their job on the border because of the judicial activism and interference by the 9th circuit nevertheless they are working hard to make america a safer place though hard to do when anybody filing a lawsuit wins this is the coldest weather in the history of the thanksgiving day parade in nyc and one of the coldest thanksgivings on record will be speaking with our great military in different parts of the world through teleconference at 9:00 am eastern then it will be off to see our coast guard patriots  to thank them for the great job they have been doing especially with the hurricanes happy thanksgiving and safety at the border or anywhere else they know nothing about it and are making our country unsafe our great law enforcement professionals must be allowed to do their job if not there will be only bedlam chaos injury and death we want the constitution as written justice roberts can say what he wants but the 9th circuit is a complete  total disaster it is out of control has a horrible reputation is overturned more than any circuit in the country 79percent  is used to get an almost guaranteed result judges must not legislate security happy thanksgiving to all it's a mean  nasty world out there the middle east in particular this is a long and historic commitment  one that is absolutely vital to america's national security   i agree 100percent in addition many billions of dollars of purchases made in us big jobs  oil you just can't win with the fake news media a big story today is that because i have pushed so hard and gotten gasoline prices so low more people are driving and i have caused traffic jams throughout our great nation sorry everyone brutal and extended cold blast could shatter all records whatever happened to global warming 79percent of these decisions have been overturned in the 9th circuit   a terrible costly and dangerous disgrace it has become a dumping ground for certain lawyers looking for easy wins and delays much talk over dividing up the 9th circuit into 2 or 3 circuits too big there are a lot of criminals in the caravan we will stop them catch and detain judicial activism by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens is putting our country in great danger not good thank you to president trump on the border no american president has ever done this before hector garza national border patrol council are so many opposing view on border and safety cases filed there and why are a vast number of those cases overturned please study the numbers they are shocking we need protection and security these rulings are making our country unsafe very dangerous and unwise sorry chief justice john roberts but you do indeed have obama judges and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country it would be great if the 9th circuit was indeed an independent judiciary but if it is why great new book out mad politics keeping your sanity in a world gone crazy by  loudon go out and get your copy today  a great read ‘trump imitation syndrome' is afflicting the president's liberal enemies thank you   make america great again oil prices getting lower great like a big tax cut for america and the world enjoy $54 was just $82 thank you to saudi arabia but let's go lower america first so-called comedian michelle wolf bombed so badly last year at

will go i hope the discovery and eventual recovery of the argentine submarine san juan brings needed closure to the wonderful families of those brave missing sailors i look forward to hearing more from my friend president  in argentina later this month the fake news is showing old footage of people climbing over our ocean area fence this is what it really looks like no climbers anymore under our administration  we no longer pay pakistan the $billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us bin laden being a prime example afghanistan being another they were just one of many countries that take from the united states without giving anything in return that's ending of course we should have captured osama bin laden long before we did i pointed him out in my book just before the attack on the world trade center president clinton famously missed his shot we paid pakistan billions of dollars  they never told us he was living there fools  loves mississippi and our great usa  from day one rick scott never wavered he was a great governor and will be even a greater senator in representing the people of florida congratulations to rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign catch and release is an obsolete term it is now catch and detain illegal immigrants trying to come into the usa often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for us asylum will be detained or turned away dems must approve border security  wall now the mayor of tijuana mexico just stated that the city is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants the backlog could last 6 months likewise the us is ill-prepared for this invasion and will not stand for it they are causing crime and big problems in mexico go home so funny to see little adam schitt d-ca talking about the fact that acting attorney general matt whitaker was not approved by the senate but not mentioning the fact that bob mueller who is highly conflicted was not approved by the senate i will be interviewed by chris wallace on  at 2:00 pm and 7:00 pm enjoy incredible to be with our great heroes today in california we will always be with you  heading to california with  kevin mccarthy  and

 mike pence they made up sources and refused to ask me the only one that would know for a quote congratulations to andrew gillum on having run a really tough and competitive race for governor of the great state of florida he will be a strong democrat warrior long into the future a force to reckon with i can get nancy pelosi as many votes as she wants in order for her to be speaker of the house she deserves this victory she has earned it but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away she will win  thank you  look forward to joining you and  tomorrow in california we are with you  their country's flag can this be possible yes because it is all a big con and the american taxpayer is paying for it isn't it ironic that large caravans of people are marching to our border

and hard she will have a terrific political future brian was unrelenting and will become a great governor for the truly wonderful people of georgia congratulations to ron desantis on becoming the new governor of florida against all odds he fought  fought  fought the result being a historic victory he never gave up and never will he will be a great governor presidential medal of freedom  people are

rating in france 26percent and an unemployment rate of almost 10percent he was just trying to get onto another subject by the way there is no country more nationalist than france very proud people-and rightfully so on trade france makes excellent wine but so does the us the problem is that france makes it very hard for the us to sell its wines into france and charges big tariffs whereas the us makes it easy for french wines and charges very small tariffs not fair must change emmanuel macron suggests building its own army to protect europe against the us china and russia but it was germany

thank you and god bless you all the prospect of presidential harassment by the dems is causing the stock market big headaches the florida election should be called in favor of rick scott and ron desantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere and many ballots are missing or forged an honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected must go with election night of money spent on protecting other countries and we get nothing but trade deficits and losses it is time that these very rich countries either pay the united states for its great military protection or protect themselvesand trade must be made free and fair hundreds of billions of dollars for the great privilege of losing hundreds of billions of dollars with these same countries on trade i told them that this situation cannot continue it is and always has been ridiculously unfair to the united states massive amounts just returned from france where much was accomplished in my meetings with world leaders never easy bringing up the fact that the us must be treated fairly which it hasn't on both military and trade we pay for large portions of other

happy 243rd birthday to our great us marine corps🇺🇸  i am in paris getting ready to celebrate the end of world war one is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war in particular that one which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time there is no reason for these massive deadly and costly forest fires in california except that forest management is so poor billions of dollars are given each year with so many lives lost all because of gross mismanagement of the forests remedy now or no more fed payments mr whitaker is very highly thought of by  senator  ambassador  leonard leo of federalist society and many more i feel certain he will make an outstanding acting attorney general matthew g whitaker is a highly respected former us attorney from iowa he was chosen by jeff sessions to be his chief of staff i did not know mr whitaker likewise as chief i did not know mr whitaker except primarily as he traveled with ag sessions no social contact president macron of france has just suggested that europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the us china and russia very insulting but perhaps europe should first pay its fair share of nato which the us subsidizes greatly just out  in arizona signatures don't match electoral corruption call for a new election we must protect our democracy thank you  for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to election theft in broward and palm beach counties the world is now watching closely in the 2016 election i was winning by so much in florida that broward county which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a number couldn't do it because not enough people live in broward for them to falsify a victory mayor gillum conceded on election day and now broward county has put him back into play bill nelson conceded election now he's back in play this is an embarrassment to our country and to democracy rick scott was up by 50000+ votes on election day now they found many votes and he is only up 15000 votes the broward effect how come they never find republican votes jeff flakey doesn't want to protect the non-senate confirmed special counsel he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in arizona for the crime of doing a terrible job a weak and ineffective guy as soon as democrats sent their best election stealing lawyer marc elias to broward county they miraculously started finding democrat votes don't worry florida i am sending much better lawyers to expose the fraud you mean they are just now finding votes in florida and georgia  but the election was on tuesday let's blame the russians and demand an immediate apology from president putin  ran a great race in georgia  he won it is time to move on presidential proclamation addressing mass migration through the southern border of the united states  law enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with election fraud in  and palm beach florida voted for rick scott great bravery shown by police california highway patrol was on scene within 3 minutes with first officer to enter shot numerous times that sheriff's sergeant died in

together with the fbi are on scene 13 people at this time have been reported dead likewise the shooter is dead along with the first police officer to enter the bar we thank attorney general jeff sessions for his service and wish him well a permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date we are pleased to announce that matthew g whitaker chief of staff to attorney general jeff sessions at the department of justice will become our new acting attorney general of the united states he will serve our country well according to nbc news voters nationwide disapprove of the so-called mueller investigation 46percent more than they approve 41percent you mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting witch hunt led by 17 angry democrats is all about in all fairness nancy pelosi deserves to be chosen speaker of the house by the democrats if they give her a hard time perhaps we will add some republican votes she has earned this great honor if the democrats think they are going to waste taxpayer money investigating us at the house level then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of classified information and much else at the senate level two can play that game to any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great midterm election just remember two words fake news i will be doing a news

information not good great job being done by congressman keith rothfus of pennsylvania thank you keith in florida there is a choice between a harvard/yale educated man named  who has been a great

open  obvious hostility  report the news accurately  fairly that will do much to put out the flame the fake news is doing everything in their power to blame republicans conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our country actually it is their fake  dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand just watched wacky tom

voting and at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what is going on republicans go out and vote twitter has removed many people from my account and more importantly they have seemingly done something that makes it much harder to join they have stifled growth to a point where it is obvious to all a few weeks ago it was a rocket ship now it is a blimp total bias the united states has been spending billions of dollars a year on illegal immigration this will not continue democrats must give us the votes to pass strong but fair laws if not we will be forced to play a much tougher hand funny how lowly rated cnn and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to september 11th and the oklahoma city bombing yet when i criticize them they go wild and scream it's just not presidential the service members who died that day included brave young marines just out of high school accomplished officers in the middle of their military careers and enlisted men who had served in theaters all over the world  in 1983 roughly 1800 marines were in beirut to keep the peace in a nation torn apart by civil war terrorists had bombed the us embassy earlier that year killing 63 people including 17 americans  we are gathered together on this solemn

french president  this morning discussed many topics including the very exciting upcoming visit to paris where  melania and i will attend the armistice day centennial commemoration to those in the caravan turnaround we are not letting people into the united states illegally go back to your country and if you want apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing remarks by president trump on a year of historic progress and action to combat the opioid crisis   the new york times has a new fake story that now the russians and chinese glad they finally added china are listening to all of my calls on cellphones except that i rarely use a cellphone  when i do it's government authorized i like hard lines just more made up fake news a very big part of the anger we see today in our society

reagan  the recovery got started on election day 2016 it took trump's tax cuts and regulation cuts to get the economy booming before that it was the worst and slowest economic recovery since the great depression it took just 6 months for trump to get to 3percent even though they said returned home to the united states also north and south korea will file a joint bid to host the 2032 olympics very exciting kim jong un has agreed to allow nuclear inspections subject to final negotiations and to permanently dismantle a test site and launch pad in the presence of international experts in the

and fully understand that campaign which is unprecedented in our history congressman peter king  really bad things were happening but they are now being exposed big stuff what will be disclosed is that there was no basis for these fisa warrants that the important information was kept from the court there's going to be a disproportionate influence of the fake dossier basically you have a counter

other jurisdictions know how many people were killed fifty times last original number no way when trump visited the island territory last october officials told him in a briefing 16 people had died from maria the washington post this was long after the hurricane took place over many months it went to 64 people then like magic 3000 people killed they hired great job fema first responders and law enforcement not easy very dangerous tremendous talent america is proud of you keep it all going finish strong my thoughts and prayers are with evelyn rodriguez this evening along with her family and friends   the story of puerto rico is the rebuilding that has occurred the president has done an extraordinary job of cleanup rebuilding electrical stuff and everything else     the people of puerto rico have one of the most corrupt governments in our country  they say all these people died in the storm in puerto rico yet 70percent of the power was out before the storm so when did people start dying at what point do you recognize that what they are doing is a political agenda couched in the nice language of journalism   keep up the great work thank you  we love the  thank you   incredible job being done by fema first responders law enforcement and all thank you gina is great  john kerry had illegal meetings with the very hostile iranian regime which can only serve to undercut our great work to the detriment of the american people he told them to wait out the trump administration was he registered under the foreign agents registration act bad senator debbie stabenow and the democrats

not good thank you    i was just briefed on hurricane florence fema first responders and law enforcement are supplied and ready we are with you   thank you   the wall street journal has it wrong we are under no pressure to make a deal with china they are under pressure to make a deal with us our markets are surging theirs are collapsing we will soon be taking in billions in tariffs  making products at home if we meet we meet this was done by the democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when i was successfully raising billions of dollars to help rebuild puerto rico if a person died for any reason like old age just add them onto the list bad politics i love puerto rico 3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit puerto rico when i left the island after the storm had hit they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths as time went by it did not go up by much then a long time later they started to report really large numbers like 3000 middle-class income hits all-time high   and will continue to rise unless the dems get in and destroy what we have built it is a cesspool of corruption and the people who did this need to be brought to justice   more text messages between former fbi employees peter strzok and lisa page are a disaster and embarrassment to the fbi  doj this should never have happened but we are learning more and more by the hour others were leaking like mad in order to get the president  we are completely ready for hurricane florence as the storm gets even larger and more powerful be careful the problem with banker jamie dimon

demonstrated no wrongdoing whatsoever  that the special counsel has no evidence of any wrongdoing in other words it's time to end this witch hunt    russian collusion was just an excuse by the democrats for having lost the election crazy maxine waters after we impeach trump we'll go after mike pence we'll get him    where are the democrats coming from the best economy in the history of our country would totally collapse if they ever took control giving the information and causing the appointment of a special c without having the courage of his own convictions  alan dershowitz      in other words the whole thing was illegally and very unfairly set up you know who's at fault for this more than anyone else comey because he leaked information and laundered it through a professor at

remember it's the economy stupid that the democrats are flailing  lying like crazy phony books articles and tv hits like no other pol has had to endure-and they are losing big very dishonest people it is mostly anonymous sources in here why should anyone trust you general mattis general kelly said it's not true     bob woodward is a liar who is like a dem operative prior to the midterms he was caught cold even by nbc i'm taking this book with a grain of salt  everyone should do the same multiple sources but almost every one of them has come out and discredited the claims made by woodward you cannot take this book too seriously katelyn caralle washington examiner the white house is a smooth running machine we are making some of the biggest and most important deals in our country's history with many more to come the dems are going crazy the white house is running beautifully we are making some of the greatest and most important deals in our countries history with many more to come big progress the woodward book is a joke just another assault against me in a barrage of assaults using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources many have already come forward to say the quotes by them like the book are fiction dems can't stand losing i'll write the real book if the democrats had won the election in 2016 gdp which was about 1percent and going down would have been minus 4percent instead of up 42percent i opened up our beautiful economic engine with regulation and tax cuts our system was choking and would have been made worse still plenty to do the gdp rate 42percent is higher than the unemployment rate 39percent for the first time in over 100 years melania and i wish all jewish people shana tova and send our warmest greetings to those celebrating rosh

way down over an already really bad last year comparison viewership declined 13percent the lowest in over a decade if the players stood proudly for our flag and anthem and it is all shown on broadcast maybe ratings could come back otherwise worse trump has set economic growth on fire during his time in office the economy has achieved feats most experts thought impossible gdp is growing at a 3 percent-plus rate the unemployment rate is near a 50 year low cnbcalso the stock market is up almost 50percent since election if the us sells a car into china there is a tax of 25percent if china sells a car into the us there is a tax of 2percent does anybody think that is fair the days of the us being ripped-off by other nations is over ford has abruptly killed a plan to sell a chinese-made

person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact and get away with it without retribution or cost don't know why washington politicians don't change libel laws secretary mattis nukes woodward allegations  jim mattis calls woodward book 'fiction' 'product of someone's rich imagination'  via  the already discredited woodward book so many lies and phony sources has me calling jeff sessions mentally retarded and a dumb southerner i said neither never used those terms on anyone including jeff and being a southerner is a great thing he made this up to divide sleepy eyes chuck todd of fake nbc news said it's time for the press to stop complaining and to start fighting back actually chuck they've been doing that from the day i announced for president they've gone all out and i won and now they're going crazy the woodward book has already been refuted and discredited by general secretary of defense james mattis and general chief of staff john kelly their quotes were made up frauds a con on the public likewise other stories and quotes woodward is a dem operative notice timing statement from white house  sarah sanders  statement from white house chief of staff general john kelly

news which is under intense scrutiny over their killing the harvey weinstein story is now fumbling around making excuses for their probably highly unethical conduct i have long criticized nbc and their journalistic standards-worse than even cnn look at their license president bashar al-assad of syria must not recklessly attack idlib province the russians and iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy hundreds of thousands of people could be killed don't let that happen according to the failing new york times the fbi started a major effort to flip putin loyalists in 2014-2016 it wasn't about trump he wasn't even close to a candidate yet  rigged witch hunt i see that john kerry the father of the now terminated iran deal is thinking of running for president i should only be so lucky although the field that is currently assembling looks really good for me the democrats none of whom voted for jeff sessions must love him now same thing with lyin' james comey the dems all hated him wanted him out thought he was disgusting until i fired him immediately he became a wonderful man a saint like figure in fact really sick two long running obama era investigations of  two very popular republican congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge just ahead of the mid-terms by the jeff sessions justice department two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time good job jeff the us is respected again  richard trumka the head of the afl-cio represented his union poorly on television this weekend some of the things he said were so against the working men and women of our country and the success of the us itself that it is easy to see why unions are doing so poorly a dem the worker in america is doing better than ever before celebrate labor day happy labor day our country is doing better than ever before with unemployment setting record lows the us has tremendous upside potential as we go about fixing some of the worst trade deals ever made by any country in the world big progress being made richard trumka the head of the afl-cio represented his union poorly on television this weekend some of the things he said were so againt the working men and women of our country and the success of the us itself that it is easy to see why unions are doing so poorly a dem the fact is that african/american unemployment is now the lowest in the history of our country same with asian hispanic and almost every other group the democrats have been all talk and no action my administration has already produced like no other and everyone sees it tiger woods showed great class in the way he answered the question about the office of the presidency and me now they say the so-called left is angry at him so sad but the center  right loves tiger kanye george foreman jim brown  so many other greats even more there is no possible way the trump tower meeting between don trump jr and a couple of russians who have very deep connections to both the clintons  fusion gps  where no information on the clintons was exchanged is a crime dems are blinded by their hatred of trump bongino no information was ever given by the trump team to russia yet the hillary clinton campaign paid for information from kremlin sources and just washed it through an intermediary christopher steele  jesse waters positions of power that's part of the story of the russia hoax christopher steele is on the payroll of hillary clinton  the fbi  when they fired him for lying they continued to use him violation of fbi regulations kept trying to verify the unverifiable  there's no fairness here if you're a democrat or a friend of hillary you get immunity or off scott free if you're connected to donald trump you get people like robert mueller  andrew weissman and his team of partisans coming after you with a vengeance and abusing their we shouldn't have to buy our friends with bad trade deals and free military protection make america great again no deal trade talks with canada conclude for the week with no agreement | breitbart  via  remember nafta was one of the worst trade deals ever made the us lost thousands of businesses and millions of jobs we were far better off before nafta should never have been signed even the vat tax was not accounted for we make new deal or go back to pre-nafta there is no political necessity to keep canada in the new nafta deal if we don't make a fair deal for the us after decades of abuse canada will be out congress should not interfere w/ these negotiations or i will simply terminate nafta entirely  we will be far better off donald trump and now we find out that there wasn't even a hearing that donald trump's 4th amendment right to privacy was signed awayand someone in there is swearing that this stuff is true when it wasn't this is the scandal here a police state  dan bongino you have a fake dossier gathered by steele paid by the clinton team to get information on trump the dossier is fake nothing in it has been verified it then filters into our american court system in order to spy on barrack obama and hillary clinton's political opponent of the doj  fbi are completely out to lunch in terms of exposing and holding those accountable who are responsible for that corruption   report there were no fisa hearings held over spy documentsit is astonishing that the fisa courts couldn't hold hearings on spy warrants targeting donald trump it isn't about carter page it's about the trump campaign you've got corruption at the doj  fbi the leadership i love canada but they've taken advantage of our country for many years i think today what has happened is that news reporting has become part of the adversary system alan dershowitz  it has become tainted and corrupt djt there is no political necessity to keep canada in the new nafta deal if we don't make a fair deal for the us after decade of abuse canada will be out congress should not interfere with these negotiations or i will simply terminate nafta entirely  we will be far better off still can't believe that bloomberg violated a firm off the record statement will they put out an apology great day in north carolina where republicans will do very well the abc/washington post poll was by far the least accurate one 2 weeks out from the 2016 election i call it a suppression poll but by election day they brought us out of shame to about even they will never learn  just came out at 48percent approval rate despite the constant and intense fake news higher than election day and higher than president obama rasmussen was one of the most accurate election day polls president donald j trump is strengthening retirement security for american workers  wow i made off the record comments to bloomberg concerning canada and this powerful understanding was blatantly violated oh well just more dishonest reporting i am used to it at least canada knows where i stand

russian she worked for fusion gps where she was paid a lot collusion bruce was a boss at the department of justice and is unbelievably still there i am very excited about the person who will be taking the place of don mcgahn as white house councel i liked don but he was not responsible for me not firing bob mueller or jeff sessions so much fake reporting and fake news the only thing james comey ever got right was when he said that president trump was not under investigation ivanka trump  jared kushner had nothing to do with the so called pushing out of don mcgahnthe fake news media has it purposelyso wrong they love to portray chaos in the white house when they know that chaos doesn't exist-just a smooth running machine with changing parts the news from the financial markets is even better than anticipated for all of you that have made a fortune in the markets or seen your 401k's rise beyond your wildest expectations more good news is coming i just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest much of the media is truth doesn't matter to them they only have their hatred  agenda this includes fake books which come out about me all the time always anonymous sources and are pure fiction enemy of the people what's going on at  is happening to different degrees at other networks with  being the worst the good news is that andy lacky is about to be fired for incompetence and much worse when lester holt got caught fudging my tape on russia they were hurt badly the hatred and extreme bias of me by  has clouded their thinking and made them unable to function but actually as i have always said this has been going on for a long time little jeff z has done a terrible job his ratings suck  att should fire him to save credibility watch kanye west says trump wants to be the ‘greatest president' for black americans  via  charge of the fisa court he should direct the presiding judge rosemary collier to hold a hearing haul all of these people from the doj  fbi in there  if she finds there were crimes committed and there were there should be a criminal referral by her  ohr told the fbi it the fake dossier wasn't true it was a lie and the fbi was determined to use it anyway to damage trump and to perpetrate a fraud on the court to spy on the trump campaign this is a fraud on the court the chief justice of the us supreme court is in lanny davis admits being anonymous source in cnn report   oh well so much for cnn saying it wasn't lanny no wonder their ratings are so low it's fake news cnn is being torn apart from within based on their being caught in a major lie and refusing to admit the mistake sloppy  a man who lives in the past and thinks like a degenerate fool making up story after story is being laughed at all over the country fake news differences they will be resolved in time by president trump and china's great president xi jinping their relationship and bond remain very strong of money on joint us-south korea war games besides the president can instantly start the joint exercises again with south korea and japan if he so chooses if he does they will be far bigger than ever before as for the uschina trade disputes and other considerable aid including money fuel fertilizer and various other commodities this is not helpful nonetheless the president believes that his relationship with kim jong un is a very good and warm one and there is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts statement from the white housepresident donald j trump feels strongly that north korea is under tremendous pressure from china because of our major trade disputes with the chinese government at the same time we also know that china is providing north korea with   how the hell is bruce ohr still employed at the justice

denuclearization as they once were despite the un sanctions which are in place i have asked secretary of state mike pompeo not to go to north korea at this time because i feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the korean peninsula social media giants are silencing millions of people can't do this even if it means we must continue to hear fake news like cnn whose ratings have suffered gravely people have to figure out what is real and what is not without censorship ex-nsa contractor to spend 63 months in jail over classified information gee this

justice took a 12 year old tax case among other things applied tremendous pressure on him and unlike michael cohen he refused to break make up stories in order to get a deal such respect for a brave

reiterate that there are serious and unpleasant consequences to crossing the border into the united states illegally if there were no serious consequences our country would be overrun with people trying to get in and our system could not handle it fake news of which there is soooo much this time the very tired new yorker falsely reported that i was going to take the extraordinary step of denying intelligence briefings to president obama never discussed or thought of even james clapper has admonished john brennan for having gone totally off the rails maybe clapper is being nice to me so he doesn't lose his security clearance for lying to congress a blue wave means crime and open borders a red wave means safety and strength i am hearing so many great things about the republican party's california gubernatorial candidate john cox he is a very successful businessman who is tired of high taxes  crime he will make california great again   make you proud of your great state again total endorsement will be going to the great state of west virginia on tuesday night to campaign  do a rally speech for a hard working and spectacular person ag patrick morrisey who is running for the us senate patrick has great energy  stamina-i need his vote to maga total endorsement just watched former intelligence official phillip mudd become totally unglued and weird while debating wonderful  over brennan's security clearance dennard destroyed him but mudd is in no mental condition to have such a clearance should be revoked   is an extraordinary woman of great accomplishment  potential she is running as a very popular republican for the congressional seat of my friend darrell issa-with his complete support diane is strong on crime loves our military  vets-has my total endorsement it is outrageous that poisonous synthetic heroin fentanyl comes pouring into the us postal system from china we can and must end this now the senate should pass the stop act  and firmly stop this poison from killing our children and destroying our country no more delay bruce ohr is at the center of false allegations which led to a multi-million dollar investigation into what apparently didn't happen darrell issa house oversight we can take out the word apparently   will bruce ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited dossier ever be fired from the jeff sessions  justice department a total joke everybody wants to keep their security clearance it's worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect brennan it certainly isn't because of the good job he did he is a political hack i hope john brennan the worst cia director in our country's history brings a lawsuit it will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the mueller rigged witch hunt he won't sue where's the collusion they made up a phony crime called collusion and when there was no collusion they say there was obstruction of a phony crime that never existed if you fight back or say anything bad about the rigged witch hunt they scream obstruction looking for trouble they are enjoying ruining people's lives and refuse to look at the real corruption on the democrat side the lies the firings the deleted emails and soooo much more mueller's angry dems are looking to impact the election they are a national disgrace disgraced and discredited bob mueller and his whole group of angry democrat thugs spent over 30 hours with the white house councel only with my approval for purposes of transparency anybody needing that much time when they know there is no russian collusion is just someone study the late joseph mccarthy because we are now in period with mueller and his gang that make joseph mccarthy look like a baby rigged witch hunt some members of the media are very angry at the fake story in the new york times they actually called to complain and apologize a big step forward from the day i announced the times has been fake news and with their disgusting new board member it will only get worse the failing new york times wrote a story that made it seem like the white house councel had turned on the president when in fact it is just the opposite  the two fake reporters knew this this is why the fake news media has become the enemy of the people so bad for america no collusion and no obstruction except by crooked hillary and the democrats all of the resignations and corruption yet heavily conflicted bob mueller refuses to even look in that direction what about the brennan comey mccabe strzok lies to congress or crooked's emails and have demanded transparency so that this rigged and disgusting witch hunt can come to a close so many lives have been ruined over nothing mccarthyism at its worst yet mueller  his gang of dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side media is even worse the failing  wrote a fake piece today implying that because white house councel don mcgahn was giving hours of testimony to the special councel he must be a john dean type rat but i allowed him and all others to testify i didn't have to i have nothing to hide i allowed white house counsel don mcgahn and all other requested members of the white house staff to fully cooperate with the special counsel in addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents most transparent in history no collusion no obstruction witch hunt the united states has ended the ridiculous 230 million dollar yearly development payment to syria saudi arabia and other rich countries in the middle east will start making payments instead of the us i want to develop the us our military and countries that help us the economy is stronger and better than ever before importantly there remains tremendous potential it will only get better with time great job  rachel campos-duffy on  has anyone looked at the mistakes that john brennan made while serving as cia director he will go down as easily the worst in history  since getting out he has become nothing less than a loudmouth partisan political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country all of the fools that are so focused on looking only at russia should start also looking in another direction china but in the end if we are smart tough and well prepared we will get along with everyone too many voices are being destroyed some good  some bad and that cannot be allowed to happen who is making the choices because i can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made let everybody participate good  bad and we will all just have to figure it out censorship is a very dangerous thing  absolutely impossible to police if you are weeding out fake news there is nothing so fake as cnn  msnbc  yet i do not ask that their sick behavior be removed i get used to it and watch with a grain of salt or don't watch at all social media is totally discriminating against republican/conservative voices speaking loudly and clearly for the trump administration we won't let that happen they are closing down the opinions of many people on the right while at the same time doing nothing to others i allowed white house counsel don mcgahn and all other requested members of the white house staff to fully cooperate with the special councel in addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents most transparent in history no collusion no obstruction witch hunt financial gain is a federal gratuity statute violation bribery statute violation honest services violationall major crimesbecause the doj is run by blank jeff sessions  gregg jarrett  so when does mueller do what must be done probably never  bruce ohr of doj is in legal jeopardy it's astonishing that he's still employed bruce  nelly ohr's bank account is getting fatter  fatter because of the dossier that they are both peddling he doesn't disclose it under fed regs using your federal office for personal bruce ohr of doj is in legal jeopardy it's astonishingthat he's still employed bruce  nelly ohr's bank account is getting fatter  fatter because of the dossier that they are both peddling he doesn't disclose it under fed regs using your federal office for personal fox news has learned that bruce ohr wrote christopher steele following the firing of james comey saying that he was afraid the anti-trump russia probe will be exposed  charles payne     how much more does mueller have to see they have blinders on rigged i say andrew's was a bigger and more incompetent blunder he should easily win his race against a super liberal actress but his political career is over which is worse hightax andrew cuomo's statement we're not going to make america great again it was never that great or hillary clinton's deplorables statement when a politician admits that we're not going to make america great again there doesn't seem to be much reason to ever vote for him this could be a career threatening statement by andrew cuomo with many wanting him to resign-he will get higher ratings than his brother chris wow big pushback on governor andrew cuomo of new york for his really dumb statement about america's lack of greatness i have already made america great again just look at the markets jobs military- setting records and we will do even better andrew choked badly mistake the us has more than double the growth rate than it had 18 months ago just announced youth unemployment is at a 50 year low   attend the big parade already scheduled at andrews air force base on a different date  go to the paris parade celebrating the end of the war on november 11th maybe we will do something next year in dc when the cost comes way down now we can buy some more jet fighters the local politicians who run washington dc poorly know a windfall when they see it when asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade they wanted a number so ridiculously high that i cancelled it never let someone hold you up i will instead how does a politician cuomo known for pushing people and businesses out of his state not to mention having the highest taxes in the us survive making the statement we're not going to make america great again it was never that great which section of the sentence is worse in speaking with some of the world's top business leaders i asked what it is that would make business jobs even better in the us stop quarterly reporting  go to a six month system said one that would allow greater flexibility  save money i have asked the sec to study wow big pushback on governor andrew cuomo of new york for his really dumb statement about america's lack of greatness i have already made america great again just look at the markets jobs military- setting records and we will do even better andrew chocked badly mistake released in 2017 if his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office it constitutes an intelligence breach  richard burr r-nc senate intel cmte chair   director brennan's recent statements purport to know as fact that the trump campaign colluded with a foreign power if director brennan's statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the cia why didn't he include it in the intelligence community assessment an incredibly corrupt fbi  doj trying to steer the outcome of a presidential election brennan has gone off the deep end he's disgraced and discredited himself his conduct has been outrageous chris farrell judicial watch how can senator richard blumenthal who went around for twenty years as a connecticut politician bragging that he was a great marine war hero in vietnam then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a marine nor ever in vietnam pass judgement on anyone loser  speaking of john brennan how did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be cia director in the first place now that is a really good question then followed by richard blumenthal of connecticut is a fake war hero so true a total fake very concerned about comey's firing afraid they will be exposed said bruce ohr doj's emails  notes show bruce ohr's connection to phony  discredited trump dossier a creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act rigged witch hunt while steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets he also asked for help with a russian oligarch  catherine herridge of     in other words they were colluding with russia the fbi received documents from bruce ohr of the justice department  whose wife nelly worked for fusion gps disgraced and fired fbi agent peter strzok this is too crazy to be believed the rigged witch hunt has zero

ones who should be investigated thank you lou so true strzok started the illegal rigged witch hunt why isn't this so-called probe ended immediately why aren't these angry and conflicted democrats instead looking at crooked hillary fired fbi agent peter strzok is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started there was no collusion or obstruction with russia and everybody including the democrats know it the only collusion and obstruction was by crooked hillary the democrats and the dnc they were all in on it clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump for things he didn't do gregg jarrett on   if we had a real attorney general this witch hunt would never have been started looking at the wrong people bruce ohr of the justice department can you believe he is still there is accused of helping disgraced christopher steele find dirt on trump ohr's wife nelly was in on the act big time worked for fusion gps on fake dossier  another terrorist attack in londonthese animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength when you give a crazed crying lowlife a break and give her a job at the white house i guess it just didn't work out good work by general kelly for quickly firing that dog lou dobbs this cannot go forwardthis special councel with all of his conflicts with his 17 angry democrats without any evidence of collusion by the trump campaign and russia the dems are the ones who should be investigated thank you lou so true should be shut down the strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt it should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors thank you judicial watch i couldn't have said it better myself guy was corrupt and had anti-trump animus strzok and others at the fbi should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation instead mueller is pretending nothing went wrong he used strzok he used the clinton dnc dossierthe whole thing tom fitton of judicial watch the strzok firing is as much about the mueller operation as anything else there would be no mueller special councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of strzok  his colleagues at the top levels of the fbi we know this such wonderful and powerful things about me a true champion of civil rights until she got fired omarosa had zero credibility with the media they didn't want interviews when she worked in the white house now that she says bad about me they will talk to her fake news  called to say that there are no tapes of the apprentice where i used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by wacky and deranged omarosa i don't have that word in my vocabulary and never have she made it up look at her many recent quotes saying scott walker of wisconsin is a tremendous governor who has done incredible things for that great state he has my complete  total endorsement he brought the amazing foxconn to wisconsin with its 15000 jobs-and so much more vote for scott on tuesday in the republican primary trump's foreign policy is actually boosting america's standing  it was my great honor to sign our new defense bill into law and to pay tribute to the greatest soldiers in the history of the world the us army the national defense authorization act is the most significant investment in our military and our warfighters in modern history  pete

and his great team on a job well done wacky omarosa already has a fully signed non-disclosure agreement just fired agent strzok formerly of the fbi was in charge of the crooked hillary clinton sham investigation it was a total fraud on the american public and should be properly redone agent peter strzok was just fired from the fbi finally the list of bad players in the fbi  doj gets longer  longer based on the fact that strzok was in charge of the witch hunt will it be dropped it is a total hoax no collusion no obstruction i just fight back the very unpopular governor of ohio and failed presidential candidate  hurt troy balderson's recent win by tamping down enthusiasm for an otherwise great candidate even kasich's lt governor lost gov race because of his unpopularity credit to troy on the big win while i know it's not presidential to take on a lowlife like omarosa and while i would rather not be doing so this is a modern day form of communication and i know the fake news media will be working overtime to make even wacky omarosa look legitimate as possible sorry really bad things nasty to people  would constantly miss meetings  work when gen kelly came on board he told me she was a loser  nothing but problems i told him to try working it out if possible because she only said great things about me until she got fired wacky omarosa who got fired 3 times on the apprentice now got fired for the last time she never made it never will she begged me for a job tears in her eyes i said ok people in the white house hated her she was vicious but not smart i would rarely see her but heard seems like the department of justice and fbi had a program to keep donald trump from becoming president     if this had happened to the other side everybody involved would be in jail this is a media coverup of the biggest story of our time many  owners plan to boycott the company if manufacturing moves overseas great most other companies are coming in our direction including harley competitors a really bad move us will soon have a level playing field or better  your paycheck is bigger your pension is stronger   unemployment numbers are better than they have been in 50 years  perhaps ever our country is booming like never before and it will get even better many companies moving back to the usa   bob mueller isn't your whole investigation premised on a fake dossier

husband still works for the department of justice i have never seen anything so rigged in my life our ag is scared stiff and missing in action it is all starting to be revealed not pretty ig report soon  witch hunt the big story that the fake news media refuses to report is lowlife christopher steele's many meetings with deputy ag bruce ohr and his beautiful wife nelly it was fusion gps that hired steele to write the phony  discredited dossier paid for by crooked hillary  the dnc i am proud to have fought for and secured the lowest african american and hispanic unemployment rates in

reputation so badly damaged by comey mccabe peter s and his lover the lovely lisa page and other top officials now dismissed or fired so many of the great men and women of the fbi have been hurt by these clowns and losers why isn't the fbi giving andrew mccabe text messages  to judicial watch or appropriate governmental authorities fbi said they won't give up even one i may have to get involved do not destroy what are they hiding mccabe wife took big campaign dollars from hillary people will the fbi ever recover it's once stellar reputation so badly damaged by comey mccabe peter s and his lover the lovely lisa page and other top officials now dismissed or fired so many of the great men and women of the fbi have been hurt by these clowns and losers why isn't the fbi giving andrew mccabe text massages to judicial watch or appropriate governmental authorities fbi said they won't give up even one i may have to get involved do not destroy what are they hiding mccabe wife took big campaign dollars from hillary people deal with mexico is coming along nicely autoworkers and farmers must be taken care of or there will be no deal new president of mexico has been an absolute

investing big dollars in usa democrats please do not distance yourselves from nancy pelosi she is a wonderful person whose ideas  policies may be bad but who should definitely be given a 4th chance she is trying very hard  has every right to take down the democrat party if she has veered too far left i have just authorized a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum with respect to turkey as their currency the turkish lira slides rapidly downward against our very strong dollar aluminum will now be 20percent and steel 50percent our relations with turkey are not good at this time be happy be cool a football game that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy is no place to protest most of that money goes to the players anyway find another way to protest stand proudly for your national anthem or be suspended without pay the nfl players are at it again taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the national anthem numerous players from different teams wanted to show their outrage at something that most of them are unable to define they make a fortune doing what they love   no evidence to launch even an investigation into potential collusion between donald trump and the russians and here we are a year and a half later jenna ellis  fbi thought they wouldn't get caught because they thought that hillary was going to win there is overt bias and that depends on whether you are democrat or republican a double standard that needs to stop   why didn't the fbi tell president trump that they had concerns about carter page is there a double standard here they told senator diane feinstein that she had a spy but not trump is that entrapment or did they just want to use page as an excuse to spy congressman ted yoho of florida is doing a fantastic job and has my complete and total endorsement tough on crime and borders ted was really helpful on tax cuts vote all the way for ted in the upcoming primary he will never let you down space force all the way this is an illegally brought rigged witch hunt run by people who are totally corrupt and/or conflicted it was started and paid for by crooked hillary and the democrats phony dossier fisa disgrace and so many lying and dishonest people already fired 17 angry dems stay tuned there has been no evidence whatsoever that donald trump or the campaign was involved in any kind of collusion to fix the 2016 election in fact the evidence is the opposite that hillary clinton  the democrats colluded with the russians to fix the 2016 election  red wave congratulations to  of michigan on a job well done also

to the new ig report collusion with russia was very real hillary clinton and her team 100percent colluded with the russians and so did adam schiff who is on tape trying to collude with what he thought was russians to obtain compromising material on djt we also know that hillary clinton paid through democrats want open borders and they want to abolish ice the brave men and women that our protecting our country from some of the most vicious and dangerous people on earth sorry we can't let that happenalso change the rules in the senate and approve strong border security presidential approval numbers are very good strong economy military and just about everything else better numbers than obama at this point by far we are winning on just about every front and for that reason there will not be a blue wave but there might be a red wave too bad a large portion of the media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the rigged witch hunt but that is why we call them fake news why aren't mueller and the 17 angry democrats looking at the meetings concerning the fake dossier and all of the lying that went on in the fbi and doj this is the most one sided witch hunt in the history of our country fortunately the facts are all coming out and fast fake news reporting a complete fabrication that i am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son donald had in trump tower this was a meeting to get information on an opponent totally legal and done all the time in politics and it went nowhere i did not know about it because of tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 trillion in debt that has been accumulated much by the obama administration while at the same time reducing taxes for our people at minimum we will make much better trade deals for our country tariffs are working big time every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the us always to our detriment i say as they cometax them if they don't want to be taxed let them make or build the product in the us in either event it means jobs and great wealth the fake news hates me saying that they are the enemy of the people only because they know it's true i am providing a great service by explaining this to the american people they purposely cause great division  distrust they can also cause war they are very dangerous  sick california wildfires are being magnified  made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized it is being diverted into the pacific ocean must also tree

make our country much richer than it is today only fools would disagree we are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and if countries are still unwilling to negotiate they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of tariffs we win either way tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our steel industry plants are opening all over the us steelworkers are working again and big dollars are flowing into our treasury other countries use tariffs against but when we use them foolish people scream tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated china market has dropped 27percent

gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent it was hillary clinton how is it ok for hillary clinton to proactively seek dirt from the russians but the trump campaign met at the russians request and that is bad marc thiessen washington post looking back on history who was treated worse alfonse capone legendary mob boss killer and public enemy number one or paul manafort political operative  reagan/dole darling now serving solitary confinement although convicted of nothing where is the russian collusion russian collusion with the trump campaign one of the most successful in history is a total hoax the democrats paid for the phony and discredited dossier which was along with comey mccabe strzok and his lover the lovely lisa page used to begin the witch hunt disgraceful paul manafort worked for ronald reagan bob dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders he worked for me for a very short time why didn't government tell me that he was under investigation these old charges have nothing to do with collusion a hoax this is a terrible situation and attorney general jeff sessions should stop this rigged witch hunt right now before it continues to stain our country any further bob mueller is totally conflicted and his 17 angry democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to usa remain in the fbi while he himself was being investigated this is a real issue it won't go into a mueller report because mueller is going to protect these guys mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation alan dershowitz fbi agent peter strzok on the mueller team should have recused himself on day one he was out to stop the election of donald trump he needed an insurance policy those are illegal improper goals trying to influence the election he should never ever been allowed to we already have a smocking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent it was hillary clinton how is it ok for hillary clinton to proactively seek dirt from the russians but the trump campaign met at the russians request and that is bad marc thiessen washington post thank you florida i love you on my way to tampa florida look forward to seeing everyone soon  worker pay rate hits highest level since 2008  border security is national security and national security is the long-term viability of our country a government shutdown is a very small price to pay for a safe and prosperous america i don't care what the political ramifications are our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades and there is no way that the democrats will allow it to be fixed without a government shutdown  has a primary on august 21st he doesn't need any help because he

governor for florida strong on crime borders and our 2nd amendment big help on tax  regulation cuts loves our military  our vets has my full  total endorsement i am looking into 3-d plastic guns being sold to the public already spoke to nra doesn't seem to make much sense collusion is not a crime but that doesn't matter because there was no collusion except by crooked hillary and the democrats one of the reasons we need great border security is that mexico's murder rate in 2017 increased by 27percent to 31174 people killed a record the democrats want open borders i want maximum border security and respect for ice and our great law enforcement professionals  rush limbaugh is a great guy who truly gets it them richer their network is highly overrated i have beaten them at every turn they want to protect their companies outside the us from being taxed i'm for america first  the american worker a puppet for no one two nice guys with bad ideas make america great again the globalist koch brothers who have become a total joke in real republican circles are against strong borders and powerful trade i never sought their support because i don't need their money or bad ideas they love my tax  regulation cuts judicial picks  more i made making america great again  a highly respected federal judge today stated that the trump administration gets great credit for reuniting illegal

supreme court brett kavanaugh your vote means a lot to me and to everyone who loves our country that open borders large scale crime and abolishing ice is good for them we must get smart and finally do what must be done for the safety and security of our country illegal immigration is a top national security problem after decades of playing games with the whole world laughing at the stupidity of our immigration laws and with democrats thinking congratulations to judge jeanine on the tremendous success of her new  best-selling book liars leakers and liberals  the case against the anti-trump

lottery catch  release sanctuary cities go to merit based immigration protect ice and law enforcement and of course keep building but much faster the wall also why is mueller only appointing angry dems some of whom have worked for crooked hillary others including himself have worked for obamaand why isn't mueller looking at all of the criminal activity  real russian collusion on the democrats side-podesta dossier is robert mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to president trump including the fact that we had a very nasty  contentious business relationship i turned him down to head the fbi one day before appointment as sc  comey is his close friend there is no collusion the robert mueller rigged witch hunt headed now by 17 increased from 13 including an obama white house lawyer angry democrats was started by a fraudulent dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc therefore the witch hunt is an illegal scam and the amazon washington post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements and they will never change dying newspaper industry no matter how much they try to distract and cover it up our country is making great progress under my leadership and i will never stop fighting for the american people as an example the failing new york times accurately 90percent of media coverage of my administration is negative despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving it's no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low i will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-trump haters in the when the media driven insane by their trump derangement syndrome reveals internal deliberations of our government it  truly puts the lives of many not just journalists at risk very unpatriotic freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news i would be willing to shut down government if the democrats do not give us the votes for border security which includes the wall must get rid of lottery catch  release etc and finally go to system of immigration based on merit we need great people coming into our country the biggest and best results coming out of the good gdp report was that the quarterly trade deficit has been reduced by $52 billion and of course the historically low unemployment numbers especially for african americans hispanics asians and women had a very good and interesting meeting at the white house with ag sulzberger publisher of the new york times spent much time talking about the vast amounts of fake news being put out by the media  how that fake news has morphed into phrase enemy of the people sad please understand there are consequences when people cross our border illegally whether they have children or not and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes congress must act on fixing the dumbest  worst immigration laws anywhere in the world vote r do you think the fake news media will ever report on this tweet

trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam taxi cabs maybe he even retained bill and crooked hillary's lawyer gee i wonder if they helped him make the choice the only collusion with russia was with the democrats so now they are looking at my tweets along with 53 million other people the rigged witch hunt continues how stupid and unfair to our countryand so the fake news doesn't waste my time with dumb questions no arrived back in washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major us steel plant in granite city illinois only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted robert mueller and his gang of 13 angry democrats obviously cannot find collusion way to go jerry this is what the league should do  the remains of american servicemen will soon be leaving north korea and heading to the united states after so many years this will be a great moment for so many families thank you to kim jong un america is open for business and us steel is back  called the case against impeaching trump which i would encourage all people with trump derangement syndrome to read  a brilliant lawyer who although a liberal democrat who probably didn't vote for me has discussed the witch hunt with great clarity and in a very positive way he has written a new and very important book promises kept  thank you  and granite city illinois

thank you georgia they say that my endorsement last week of brian kemp in the republican primary for governor against a very worthy opponent lifted him from 5 points down to a 70percent to 30percent victory two very good and talented men in a great race but congratulations to brian obviously the european union as represented by  and the united states as represented by yours truly love each other  along quickly european union nations will be open to the united states and at the same time benefiting by everything we are doing for them there was great warmth and feeling in the room a breakthrough has been quickly made that nobody thought possible great meeting on trade today with  and representatives of the european union we have come to a very strong understanding and are all believers in no tariffs no barriers and no subsidies work on documents has already started and the process is moving thank you very much working hard  sergio marchionne who passed away today was one of the most brilliant  successful car executives since the days of the legendary henry ford it was a great honor for me to get to know sergio as potus he loved the car industry and fought hard for it he will be

great job      the united states and the european union have a $1 trillion bilateral trade relationship  the largest economic relationship in the world we want to further strengthen this trade relationship to the benefit of all american and european citizens  congratulations to brian kemp on your very big win in georgia last night wow 69-30 those are big numbers now go win against the open border crime loving opponent that the democrats have given you she is weak on vets the military and the 2nd amendment win what kind of a lawyer would tape a client so sad is this a first never heard of it before why was the tape so abruptly terminated cut while i was presumably saying positive things i hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped can this be so too bad china is targeting our farmers who they know i love  respect as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the us they are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt we were being nice until now china made $517 billion on us last year when you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation it will only take longer to make a deal and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity negotiations are going really well be cool the end result will be worth it every time i see a weak politician asking to stop trade talks or the use of tariffs to counter unfair tariffs i wonder what can they be thinking are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off  lost $817 billion on trade last year no weakness the russia hoax the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton  frame donald trump is a hot seller already number one more importantly it is a great book that everyone is talking about it covers the rigged witch hunt brilliantly congratulations to gregg jarrett so sad and unfair that the fcc wouldn't approve the sinclair broadcast merger with tribune this would have been a great and much needed conservative voice for and of the people liberal fake news nbc and comcast gets approved much bigger but not sinclair disgraceful the european union is coming to washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on trade i have an idea for them both the us and the eu drop all tariffs barriers and subsidies that would finally be called free market and fair trade hope they do it we are ready but they won't today it was my great honor to be in kansas city missouri to pay tribute to the men and women who make freedom possible thank you    on the heels of the very successful launch of the  national council for the american worker congress should reauthorize  and ensure the american workforce remains stronger than ever   i want to thank the  for your devotion to our fallen heroes unknown soldiers prisoners of war those missing in action and their families      i'm very concerned that russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming election based on the fact that no president has been tougher on russia than me they will be pushing very hard for the democrats they definitely don't want trump make america great again heading to missouri to be with many of my great friends vfw here we come our country is doing great best financial numbers on the planet great to have usa winning again today is the day to vote for brian kemp will be great for georgia full endorsement  tariffs are the greatest either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with tariffs it's as simple as that and everybody's talking remember we are the piggy bank that's being robbed all will be great countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to washington to negotiate this should have taken place many years ago butas the saying goes better late than never  showcase  lou barletta was one of my first supporters he is tough on crime and borders will be a great senator from pennsylvania his opponent is weak on crime ice and borders we need lou  robert will do a great job for our vets we also recently won choice  in my opinion the washington post is nothing more than an expensive the paper loses a fortune lobbyist for amazon is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought the amazon washington post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the internet tax case in the us supreme court two months ago next up is the us post office which they use at a fraction of real cost as their delivery boy for a big percentage of their packages a rocket has not been launched by north korea in 9 months likewise no nuclear tests japan is happy all of asia is happy but the fake news is saying without ever asking me always anonymous sources that i am angry because it is not going fast enough wrong very happy when you hear the fake news talking negatively about my meeting with president putin and all that i gave up remember i gave up nothing we merely talked about future benefits for both countries also we got along very well which is a good thing except for the corrupt media carter page wasn't a spy wasn't an agent of the russians he would have cooperated with the fbi it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump tom fitton  a disgrace to america they should drop the discredited mueller witch hunt now and the doj fbi and obama gang need to be held to account source  was the major source avoided talking about it being the clinton campaign behind it misled the court to provide a pretext to spy on the trump team not about carter pagewas all about getting trump it was classified to cover up misconduct by the fbi and the justice department in misleading the court by using this dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the trump team this is a clinton campaign document it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump so we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and fake dirty dossier that was paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the dnc that was knowingly  falsely submitted to fisa and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited mueller witch hunt tom fitton on  at 6:15 am now judicial watch to iranian president rouhani never ever threaten the united states again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before we are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence  death be cautious so president obama knew about russia before the election why didn't he do something about it why didn't he tell our campaign because it is all a big hoax that's why and he thought crooked hillary was going to win happy birthday   i had a great meeting with putin and the fake news used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it so bad for our country  on   source  was the fake dossier yes the dirty dossier paid for by democrats as a hit piece against trump and looking for information that could discredit candidate  trump carter page was just the foot to surveil the trump campaign illegal andrew mccarthy i said this could never happen this is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff not just the people who gave it it is so bad it screams out at you  on the whole fisa scam which led to the rigged mueller witch hunt watching los angeles possible hostage situation very closely active barricaded suspect lapd working with federal law enforcement looking more  more like the trump campaign for president was illegally being spied upon surveillance for the political gain of crooked hillary clinton and the dnc ask her how that worked out she did better with crazy bernie republicans must get tough now an illegal scam congratulations to  and  on being successful in getting the carter page fisa documents as usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the department of justice and fbi misled the courts witch hunt rigged a scam troy balderson of ohio is running for congress against a nancy pelosi liberal who is weak on crime  borders troy is the total opposite and loves our military vets  2nd amendment early voting just started with election day on august 7th troy has my full  total endorsement brian kemp who is running for governor of georgia and has my full endorsement is campaigning tonight with vp  brian is very strong on crime and borders loves our military vets and the 2nd amendment he will be a great governor no collusion no obstruction but that doesn't matter because the 13 angry democrats who are only after republicans and totally protecting democrats want this witch hunt to drag out to the november election republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing the rigged witch hunt headed by the 13 angry democrats and now 4 more have been added one who worked directly for obama wh seems intent on damaging the republican party's chances in the november election this democrat excuse for losing the ‘16 election never ends inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer's office early in the morning almost unheard of even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client totally unheard of  perhaps illegal the good news is that your favorite president did nothing wrong brian kemp who is running for governor of georgia and has my full endorsement is campaigning tonight with  brian is very strong on crime and borders loves our military vets and the 2nd amendment he will be a great governor the nfl national anthem debate is alive and well again can't believe it isn't it in contract that players must stand at attention hand on heart the $40000000 commissioner must now make a stand first time kneeling out for game second time kneeling out for season/no pay i got severely criticized by the fake news media for being too nice to president putin in the old days they would call it diplomacy if i was loud  vicious i would have been criticized for being too tough remember when they said i was too tough with chairman kim hypocrites so important should have been done years ago  farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years the price of soybeans has fallen 50percent since 5 years before the election a big reason is bad terrible trade deals with other countries they put on massive tariffs and barriers canada charges 275percent on dairy farmers will win the united states should not be penalized because we are doing so well tightening now hurts all that we have done the us should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and bad trade deals debt coming due  we are raising rates really china the european union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower while the us is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day taking away our big competitive edge as usual not a level playing field my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in missouri such a tragedy such a great loss may god be with you all will the dems and fake news ever learn this is classic  trump recognized russian meddling many times  proliferation cyber attacks trade ukraine middle east peace north korea and more there are many answers some easy and some hard to these problemsbut they can all be solved the summit with russia was a great success except with the real enemy of the people the fake news media i look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed including stopping terrorism security for israel nuclear i told you so the european union just slapped a five billion dollar fine on one of our great companies google they truly have taken advantage of the us but not for long really big jobs meeting today at the white house 3 pm trump recognized russian meddling many times thank you to  and  for actually showing the clips the fake news wants no part of that narrative too bad they don't want to focus on all of the economic and jobs records being set the fake news media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with russia even a confrontation that could lead to war they are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that i'll probably have a good relationship with putin we are doing much better than any other country the fake news media is going crazy they make up stories without any backup sources or proof many of the stories written about me and the good people surrounding me are total fiction problem is when you complain you just give them more publicity but i'll complain anyway the democrats have a death wish in more ways than one they actually want to abolish ice this should cost them heavily in the midterms yesterday the republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ice thank you to novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs likewise to pfizer we are making a big push to actually reduce the prices maybe substantially on prescription drugs a total disgrace that turkey will not release a respected us pastor andrew brunson from prison he has been held hostage far too long  should do something to free this wonderful christian husband  father he has done nothing wrong and his family needs him trump recognized russian meddling many times  the two biggest opponents of ice in america today are the democratic party and ms-13 thank you to congressman kevin yoder he secured $5 billion for border security now we need congress to support kevin has been strong on crime the border the 2nd amendment and he loves our military and vets  has my full and total endorsement brian kemp is running for governor of the great state of georgia the primary is on tuesday brian is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration he loves our military and our vets and protects our second amendment i give him my full and total endorsement 34 million jobs created since our great election victory far greater than ever anticipated and only getting better as new and greatly improved trade deals start coming to fruition some people hate the fact that i got along well with president putin of russia they would rather go to war than see this it's called trump derangement syndrome a lot of democrats wished they voted for the tax cuts because the economy is booming we could have 4percent growth now and the fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again     congratulations to martha roby of the great state of alabama on her big gop primary win for congress my endorsement came appropriately late but when it came the flood gates opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve enjoy russia has agreed to help with north korea where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along there is no rush the sanctions remain big benefits and exciting future for north korea at end of process while the nato meeting in brussels was an acknowledged triumph with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace the meeting with russia may prove to be in the long run an even greater success many positive things will come out of that meeting so many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in helsinki putin and i discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting we got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match big results will come prosperity is returning donald trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate now as the most effective president the most successful president in modern american history thank you to the great lou dobbs the democrats want to abolish ice which will mean more crime in our country i want to give ice a big cheer vote republican in november the meeting between president putin and myself was a great success except in the fake news media the economy of the united states is stronger than ever before thank you  the president has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations what's he supposed to think while i had a great meeting with nato raising vast amounts of money i had an even better meeting with vladimir putin of russia sadly it is not being reported that way the fake news is going crazy i had a great meeting with nato they have paid $33 billion more and will pay hundreds of billions of dollars more in the future only because of me nato was weak but now it is strong again bad for russia the media only says i was rude to leaders never mentions the money thank you  you really get it the president has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations what's he supposed think will be interviewed on  tonight at 9pme and  tomorrow night at 8pme enjoy a productive dialogue is not only good for the united states and good for russia but it is good for the world   i would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics   as i said today and many times before i have great confidence in my intelligence people however i also recognize that in order to build a brighter future we cannot exclusively focus on the past  as the world's two largest nuclear powers we must get along  thank you helsinki finland  joint press conference from helsinki finland  it was an honor to join you this morning thank you  our relationship with russia has never been worse thanks to many years of us foolishness and stupidity and now the rigged witch hunt president obama thought that crooked hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the fbi about russian meddling he said it couldn't happen was no big deal  did nothing about it when i won it became a big deal and the rigged witch hunt headed by strzok received many calls from leaders of nato countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations both present  future we had a truly great summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media nato is now strong  rich congratulations to france who played extraordinary soccer on winning the 2018 world cup additionally congratulations to president putin and russia for putting on a truly great world cup tournament -- one of the best ever know how to do is resist and obstruct this is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country  but at some point it will heal over the years i would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough  that i should have gotten saint petersburg in addition much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the dems heading to helsinki finland  looking forward to meeting with president putin tomorrow unfortunately no matter how well i do at the summit if i was given the great city of moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by russia there hasn't been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in north korea there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages who knows how it will all turn out in the end but why isn't the fake news talking about these wonderful facts because it is fake news these russian individuals did their work during the obama years why didn't obama do something about it  because he thought crooked hillary clinton would win that's why had nothing to do with the trump administration but fake news doesn't want to report the truth as usual our prayers are with those affected by the flooding in japan we commend the rescue efforts and offer condolences to all who were injured or lost loved ones  remember it was little jeff z and his people who are told exactly what to say who said i could not win the election in that there was no way to 270 over  over again in the electoral college i got 306 they were sooooo wrong in their election coverage still hurting so funny i just checked out fake news cnn for the first time in a long time they are dying in the ratings to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of jim acosta actually a nice guy they didn't but they did say i already lost in my meeting with putin fake news the stories you heard about the 12 russians yesterday took place during the obama administration not the trump administration why didn't they do something about it especially when it was reported that president obama was informed by the fbi in september before the election where is the dnc server and why didn't the fbi take possession of it deep state the stories you heard about the 12 russians yesterday took place during the obama administration not the trump administrations why didn't they do something about it especially when it was reported that president obama was informed by the fbi in september before the election the stock market hit 25000 yesterday jobs are at an all time record and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government it is all happening i have arrived in scotland and will be at trump turnberry for two days of meetings calls and hopefully some golf my primary form of exercise the weather is beautiful and this place is incredible tomorrow i go to helsinki for a monday meeting with vladimir putin this is now changing for the first time  🇺🇸🇬🇧  joint press conference with prime minister theresa may congressman matt gaetz of florida is one of the finest and most talented people in congress strong on crime the border illegal immigration the 2nd amendment our great military  vets matt worked tirelessly on helping to get our massive tax cuts he has my full endorsement great success today at nato billions of additional dollars paid by members since my election great spirit a very nice note from chairman kim of north korea great progress being made  trump has been the most consequential president in history when it comes to minority employment in june for instance the unemployment rate for hispanics and latinos 16 years and older fell to 46percent its lowest level ever from 49percent in may  thank you    press conference in brussels belgium on top of it all germany just started paying russia the country they want protection from billions of dollars for their energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from russia not acceptable all nato nations must meet their 2percent commitment and that must ultimately go to 4percent presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get germany and other rich nato nations to pay more toward their protection from russia they pay only a fraction of their cost the us pays tens of billions of dollars too much to subsidize europe and loses big on trade as i head out to a very important nato meeting i see that fbi lover/agent lisa page is dodging a subpoena  is refusing to show up and testify what can she possibly say about her statements and lies so much corruption on the other side where is the attorney general  billions of additional dollars are being spent by nato countries since my visit last year at my request but it isn't nearly enough us spends too much europe's borders are bad pipeline dollars to russia are not acceptable how can the rigged witch hunt proceed when it was started influenced and worked on for an extended period of time by former fbi agent/lover peter strzok read his hate filled and totally biased emails and the answer is clear ex-fbi layer lisa page today defied a house of representatives issued subpoena to testify before congress wow but is anybody really surprised  together with her lover fbi agent peter strzok she worked on the rigged witch hunt perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case ever if the democrats want to win supreme court and other court picks don't obstruct and resist but rather do it the good ol' fashioned way win elections what good is nato if germany is paying russia billions of dollars for gas and energy why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment the us is paying for europe's protection then loses billions on trade must pay 2percent of gdp immediately not by 2025 democrats in congress must no longer obstruct vote to fix our terrible immigration laws now i am watching what is going on from europe it would be soooo simple to fix judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works they are just using children things up better than ever before but it can't go too quickly i am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers and will win i am in brussels but always thinking about our farmers soy beans fell 50percent from 2012 to my election farmers have done poorly for 15 years other countries' trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses i will open bilateral breakfast with nato secretary general in brussels belgium  what good is nato if germany is paying russia billions of dollars for gas and energy why are their only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment the us is paying for europe's protection then loses billions on trade must pay 2percent of gdp immediately not by 2025 just talked with pfizer ceo and  on our drug pricing blueprint pfizer is rolling back price hikes so american patients don't pay more we applaud pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same great news for the american people the european union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in europe us has a $151 billion trade deficit and then they want us to happily defend them through nato and nicely pay for it just doesn't work a recent emerson college epoll said that most americans especially hispanics feel that they are better off under president trump than they were under president obama many countries in nato which we are expected to defend are not only short of their current commitment of 2percent which is low but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made will they reimburse the us informing the republican senators of my nomination of judge brett kavanaugh   i am on air force one flying to nato and hear reports that the fbi lovers peter strzok and lisa page are getting cold feet on testifying about  the rigged witch hunt headed by 13 angry democrats and people that worked for obama for 8 years total disgrace on behalf of the united states congratulations to the thai navy seals and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in thailand such a beautiful moment all freed great job thank you to all of my great supporters really big progress being made other countries wanting to fix crazy trade deals economy is roaring supreme court pick getting great reviews new poll says trump at over 90percent is the most popular republican in history of the party wow nato countries must pay more the united states must pay less very unfair getting ready to leave for europe first meeting nato the us is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them not fair to the us taxpayer on top of that we lose $151 billion on trade with the european union charge us big tariffs  barriers tonight it was my honor and privilege to nominate judge brett kavanaugh to the united states supreme court   happy 100th birthday to our amazing current and former army warrant officers thank you for your century of service as the indispensable guardians of our great  technology   pfizer  others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason they are merely taking advantage of the poor  others unable to defend themselves while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in europe  elsewhere we will respond the failing ny times fake news story today about breast feeding must be called out the us strongly supports breast feeding but we don't believe women should be denied access to formula many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty i have confidence that kim jong un will honor the contract we signed  even more importantly our handshake we agreed to the denuclearization of north korea china on the other hand may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on chinese trade-hope not i have long heard that the most important decision a us president can make is the selection of a supreme court justice will be announced tonight at 9:00 pm europe far more than it does the us by some accounts the us is paying for 90percent of nato with many countries nowhere close to their 2percent commitment on top of this the european union has a trade surplus of $151 million with the us with big trade barriers on us goods no the united states is spending far more on nato than any other country this is not fair nor is it acceptable while these countries have been increasing their contributions since i took office they must do much more germany is at 1percent the us is at 4percent and nato benefits they just didn't get it but they do now  looking forward to announcing my final decision on the united states supreme court justice at 9:00pme tomorrow night at the  an exceptional person will be chosen iranian harassment of us warships:2015 222016 362017 142018 0source  the us is working very closely with the government of thailand to help get all of the children out of the cave and to safety very brave and

the pakistani fraudster uranium one podesta  so much more it's a democrat con job public opinion has turned strongly against the rigged witch hunt and the special counsel because the public

our next justice of the supreme court twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace will that include the failing new york times and propaganda machine for amazon the washington post who constantly quote anonymous sources that in my opinion don't exist they will both be out of business in 7 years public opinion has turned strongly against the rigged witch hunt and the special councel because the public understands that there was no  collusion with russia so ridiculous that the two fbi lovers were a fraud against our nation  that the only collusion was with the dems just won

independence day to all  after having written many best selling books and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write it should be noted that the fake news constantly likes to pore over my tweets looking for a mistake i capitalize certain words only for emphasis not b/c they should be capitalized the washington post is constantly quoting anonymous sources that do not exist rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for they are a disgrace to journalism but then again so are many others heading to west virginia to be with my friend  jim justice at his beautiful greenbrier resort he works hard does a great job and raises lots of money for charities wow the nsa has deleted 685 million phone calls and text messages privacy violations they blame technical irregularities such a disgrace the witch hunt continues now that harley-davidson is moving part of its operation out of the us my administration is working with other motor cycle companies who want to move into the us harley customers are not happy with their move sales are down 7percent in 2017 the us is where the action is just out that the obama administration granted citizenship during the terrible iran deal negotiation to 2500 iranians including to government officials how big and bad is that many good conversations with north korea-it is going well in the meantime no rocket launches or nuclear testing in 8 months all of asia is thrilled only the opposition party which includes the fake news is complaining if not for me we would now be at war with north korea how can the democrats who are weak on the border and weak on crime do well in november the people of our country want and demand safety and security while the democrats are more interested in  ripping apart and demeaning and not properly funding our great law enforcement when we have an infestation of ms-13 gangs in certain parts of our country who do we send to get them out ice they are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country dems do not appreciate the great job they do nov the economy is doing perhaps better than ever before and that's prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair trade deals ever made by any country in any event they are coming along very well most countries agree that they must be changed but nobody ever asked i interviewed 4 very impressive people yesterday on monday i will be announcing my decision for justice of the united states supreme court just arrived in west virginia  crazy maxine waters said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics is rapidly becoming together with nancy pelosi the face of the democrat party her ranting and raving even referring to herself as a wounded animal will make people flee the democrats after having written many best selling books and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write it should be noted that the fake news constantly likes to pour over my tweets looking for a mistake i capitalize certain words only for emphasis not b/c they should be capitalized the washington post is constantly quoting anonymous sources that do not exist rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for they are a discgrace to journalism but then again so are many others many democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their leadership wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ice thereby declaring war on law  order these people will be voting for republicans in november and in many cases joining the republican party today it was my great honor to welcome prime minister mark rutte of the netherlands to the   congratulations to andres manuel lopez obrador on becoming the next president of mexico i look very much forward to working with him there is much to be done that will benefit both the united states and mexico a big week especially with our numerous victories in the supreme court heading back to the white house now focus will be on the selection of a new supreme court justice exciting times for our country economy may be stronger than it has ever been the liberal left also known as the democrats want to get rid of ice who do a fantastic job and want open borders crime would be rampant and uncontrollable make america great again i will be interviewed by  at 10:00 am on  when people come into our country illegally we must immediately escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world republicans want strong borders and no crime dems want open borders and are weak on crime i will be interviewed by  on sunday on  at 10:00 a m enjoy either we need to elect more republicans in november or republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote or filibuster rule or better yet do both cryin' chuck would do it on day one but we'll never give him the chance some great legislation awaits be smart i never pushed the republicans in the house to vote for the immigration bill either goodlatte 1 or 2 because it could never have gotten enough democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold i released many prior to the vote knowing we need more republicans to win in nov a friend of mine and a man who has truly seen politics and life as few others ever will sean spicer has written a great new book the briefing politics the press and the president it is a story told with both heart and knowledge really good go get it i will be making my choice for justice of the united states supreme court on the first monday after the july 4th holiday july 9th just spoke to king salman of saudi

refused to answer many questions there was no collusion and the witch hunt headed by 13 angry democrats and others who are totally conflicted is rigged home addresses  putting these selfless public servants in harm's way these radical protesters want anarchy  but the only response they will find from our government is law and order in recent days we have heard shameless attacks on our courageous

example able to support a candidate of his or her choice without having those who control the union deciding for them big loss for the coffers of the democrats house republicans should pass the strong but fair immigration bill known as goodlatte ii in their afternoon vote today even though the dems won't let it pass in the senate passage will show that we want strong borders  security while the dems want open borders = crime  win congratulations to maxine waters whose crazy rants have made her together with nancy pelosi the unhinged face of the democrat party together they will make america

mcmaster on your big election win south carolina loves you we are all proud of you and peggy  today we tell the story of an incredible hero who defended our nation in world war two  first lieutenant

our era was there a conspiracy in the obama department of justice and the fbi to prevent donald trump from becoming president of the us and was strzok at the core of the conspiracy  judge andrew napolitano the face of the democrats is now maxine waters who together with nancy pelosi have established a fine leadership team they should always stay together and lead the democrats who want open borders and unlimited crime well into the futureand pick crooked hillary for pres a harley-davidson should never be built in another country-never their employees and customers are already very angry at them if they move watch it will be the beginning of the end they surrendered they quit the aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before it was great being with governor henry mcmaster last night in south carolina henry is tough on crime and borders loves our military and our vets and has created many jobs and a great economy go out and vote for henry today he will never let you down we are finishing our study of tariffs on cars from the eu in that they have long taken advantage of the us in the form of trade barriers and tariffs in the end it will all even out and it won't take very long when i had harley-davidson officials over to the white house i chided them about tariffs in other countries like india being too high companies are now coming back to america harley must know that they won't be able to sell back into us without paying a big tax we are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers workers and companies we are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint they must play fair or they will pay tariffs early this year harley-davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in kansas city to thailand that was long before tariffs were announced hence they were just using tariffs/trade war as an excuse shows how unbalanced  unfair trade is but we will fix it thank you south carolina now let's get out tomorrow and vote for   just landed in south carolina will be at the mcmaster rally shortly  the hearing of peter strzok and the other hating frauds at the fbi  doj should be shown to the public on live television not a closed door hearing that nobody will see we should expose these people for what they are there should be total transparency why is senator mark warner d-va perhaps in a near drunken state claiming he has information that only he and bob mueller the leader of the 13 angry democrats on a witch hunt knows isn't this highly illegal is it being investigated director david lynch trump could go down as one of the greatest presidents  surprised that harley-davidson of all companies would be the first to wave the white flag i fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the eu which has hurt us badly on trade down $151 billion taxes just a harley excuse be patient   congresswoman maxine waters an extraordinarily low iq person has become together with nancy pelosi the face of the democrat party she has just called for harm to supporters of which there are many of the make america great again movement be careful what you wish for max will be heading to one of my favorite places south carolina to fight for one of my original fighters governor henry mcmaster speaking at 7:00 pm if this is done illegal immigration will be stopped in it's tracks and at very little by comparison cost this is the only real answer and we must continue to build the wall hiring manythousands of judges and going through a long and complicated legal process is not the way to go will always be disfunctional people must simply be stopped at the border and told they cannot come into the us illegally children brought back to their country such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the obama administration and ours actually we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under obama fake news is working overtime i have tried to stay uninvolved with the department of justice and fbi although i do not legally have to because of the now totally discredited and very expensive witch hunt currently going on but you do have to ask why the doj  fbi aren't giving over requested documents  has been a great help to me on cutting taxes creating great new healthcare programs at low cost fighting for border security our military and are vets he is tough on crime and has my full endorsement the great state of louisiana we want clay the red hen restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies doors and windows badly needs a paint job rather than refusing to serve a fine person like sarah huckabee sanders i always had a rule if a restaurant is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside former attorney general michael mukasey said that president trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on trump tower actually far greater than would ever have been believed  has been a great help to me on cutting taxes creating great new healthcare programs at low cost fighting for border security our military and are vets he is tough on crime and has my full endorsement the great state of louisiana we want clay house republicans could easily pass a bill on strong border security but remember it still has to pass in the senate and for that we need 10 democrat votes and all they do is resist they want open borders and don't care about crime need more republicans to win in november  is now whimpering to all that he did the famous hair show with me where he seriously messed up my hair  that he would have now done it differently because it is said to have humanized me-he is taking heat he called  said monster ratings be a man jimmy the united states is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial trade barriers and tariffs on goods going into their country remove those barriers  tariffs or be met with more than reciprocity by the usa trade must be fair and no longer a one way street our immigration policy laughed at all over the world is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years immigration must be based on merit we need people who will help to make america great again we cannot allow all of these people to invade our country when somebody comes in we must immediately with no judges or court cases bring them back from where they came our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and law and order most children come without parents democrats fix the laws don't resist we are doing a far better job than bush and obama but we need strength and security at the border cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our country strong borders no crime major wall street journal opinion piece today talking about the russian witch hunt and the disgrace that it is so many people hurt so bad for our country a total sham america is open for business  thank you    happy birthday to supreme court justice clarence thomas a friend and great

pennsylvania where we have both strongly endorsed one of the finest men around congressman keith  he is running against  who is telling drudge report  obama kept them in cages wrapped them in foil we

national association of manufacturers just announced that 951percent of manufacturers have a positive outlook for their companies  this is the best number in the association's history the russian witch hunt is rigged   poll numbers plummet on the democrat inspired and paid for russian witch hunt with all of the bias lying and hate by the investigators people want the investigators investigated

long placed on the us  its great companies and workers by the european union if these tariffs and barriers are not soon broken down and removed we will be placing a 20percent tariff on all of their cars coming into the us build them here our first duty and our highest loyalty is to the citizens of the united states we will not rest until our border is secure our citizens are safe and we finally end the immigration crisis once and for all  we are gathered today to hear directly from the american victims of illegal immigration these are the american citizens permanently separated from their loved ones b/c they were killed by criminal illegal aliens these are the families the media ignores hope opec will increase output substantially need to keep prices down we must maintain a strong southern border we cannot allow our country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief hoping it will help them in the elections obama and others had the same pictures and did nothing about it 80percent of mexico's exports come to the united states they totally rely on us which is fine with me they do have though very strong immigration laws the us has pathetically weak and ineffective immigration laws that the democrats refuse to help us fix will speak to mexico congressman ron desantis a top student at yale and harvard law school

legislation after the red wave elect more republicans in  november and we will pass the finest fairest and most comprehensive immigration bills anywhere in the world right now we have the dumbest and the worst dems are doing nothing but obstructing remember their motto resist ours is produce even if we get 100percent republican votes in the senate we need 10 democrat votes to get a much needed immigration bill  the dems are obstructionists who won't give votes for political reasons  because they don't care about crime coming from border so we need to elect more r's our great judge jeanine pirro is out with a new book liars leakers and liberals the case against the anti-trump conspiracy which is fantastic go get it based on the tariffs and trade barriers long placed on the us and it

democrats leading the witch hunt   had a great meeting with the house gop last night at the capitol they applauded and laughed loudly when i mentioned my experience with mark sanford i have never been a fan of his more records   fbi texts have revealed anti-trump bias   big news but the fake news doesn't want to cover total corruption the witch hunt has turned out to be a scam at some point soon the mainstream media will have to cover correctly too big a story it's the democrats fault they won't give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation they want open borders which breeds horrible crime republicans want security but i am working on something it never ends the fake news is not mentioning the safety and security of our country when talking about illegal immigration our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world and the dems will do anything not to change them  to obstruct-want open borders which means crime thank you   earlier today  melania and i were honored to welcome king felipe vi and queen letizia of spain to the 🇺🇸🇪🇸  homeland security  did a fabulous job yesterday at the press conference explaining security at the border and for our country while at the same time recommending changes to obsolete  nasty laws which force family separation we want heart and security in america i want to take a moment to address the current illegal immigration crisis on the southern borderit has been going on for many many decades  thank you    join me tomorrow in duluth minnesota for a  rally tickets      now is the best opportunity ever for congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration get it done always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security we must always arrest people coming into our country illegally of the 12000 children 10000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip and only 2000 are with their parents many of whom have tried to enter our country illegally on numerous occasions democrats are the problem they don't care about crime and want illegal immigrants no matter how bad they may be to pour into and infest our country like ms-13 they can't win on their terrible policies so they view them as potential voters if you don't have borders you don't have a country crime in germany is up 10percent plus officials do not want to report these crimes since migrants were accepted others countries are even worse be smart america i can't think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election inspector general horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election a rigged witch huntp comey gave strozk his marching orders mueller is comey's best friend witch hunt if president obama who got nowhere with north korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed had gotten along with north korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that i have the fake news would have named him a national hero it is the democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with boarder security and crime tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by crime coming from illegal immigration change the laws change the laws children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country has anyone been looking at the crime taking place south of the border it is historic with some countries the most dangerous places in the world not going to happen in the us we don't want what is happening with immigration in europe to happen with us the people of germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous berlin coalition crime in germany is way up big mistake made all over europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture why don't the democrats give us the votes to fix the world's worst immigration laws where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs including ms-13 coming into our country illegally the highest level of bias i've ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer trey gowdy on the fbi's own peter strzok also remember that they all worked for slippery james comey and that comey is best friends with robert mueller a really sick deal isn't it the democrats should get together with their republican counterparts and work something out on border security  safety don't wait until after the election because you are going to lose why was the fbi's sick loser peter strzok working on the totally discredited mueller team of 13 angry  conflicted democrats when strzok was giving crooked hillary a free pass yet telling his lover lawyer lisa page that we'll stop trump from becoming president witch hunt why was the fbi giving so much information to the fake news media they are not supposed to be doing that and knowing the enemy of the people fake news they put their own spin on it truth doesn't matter to them witch hunt there was no russian collusion oh i see there was no russian collusion so now they look for obstruction on the no russian collusion the phony russian collusion was a made up hoax too bad they didn't look at crooked hillary like this double standard washington post employees want to go on strike because bezos isn't paying them enough i think a really long strike would be a great idea employees would get more money and we would get rid of fake news for an extended period of time is  a registered lobbyist our economy is perhaps better than it has ever been companies doing really well and moving back to america and jobs numbers are the best in 44 years the denuclearization deal with north korea is being praised and celebrated all over asia they are so happy over here in our country some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give trump a win even if it does save potentially millions  millions of lives holding back the war games during the negotiations was my request because they are very expensive and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation also quite provocative can start up immediately if talks break down which i hope will not happen funny how the fake news in a coordinated effort with each other likes to say i gave sooo much to north korea because i met that's because that's all they have to disparage we got so much for peace in the world  more is being added in finals even got our hostages/remains daniel henninger of the wall street journal this ig report makes it clear as did rod rosenstein's memo that trump was absolutely justified unquestionably justified in firing jim comey so i think the mueller investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now  witch hunt please clear up the fake news  chuck schumer said the summit was what the texans call all cattle and no hat thank you chuck but are you sure you got that right no more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place blew up launch sites hostages already back hero remains coming home  much more the ig report totally destroys james comey and all of his minions including the great lovers peter strzok and lisa page who started the disgraceful witch hunt against so many innocent people it will go down as a dark and dangerous period in american history my supporters are the smartest strongest most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history it is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country as we get stronger so does our country best numbers ever democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the border by working with republicans on new legislation for a change this is why we need more republicans elected in november democrats are good at only three things high taxes high crime and obstruction sad the ig report totally distroys james comey and all of his minions including the great lovers peter strzok and lisa page who started the disgraceful witch hunt against so many innocent people it will go down as a dark and dangerous period in american history great discussions with european union commission president jean-claude juncker and eu council president donald tusk at the  in canada last week  the fake news media said that i did not get along with other leaders at the  in canada they are once again wrong  i have a great relationship with angela merkel of germany but the fake news media only shows the bad photos implying anger of negotiating an agreement where i am asking for things that no other american president would ask for  i've had to beat 17 very talented people including the bush dynasty then i had to beat the clinton dynasty and now i have to beat a phony witch hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the ig reportand never forget the fake news media it never ends wow what a tough sentence for paul manafort who has represented ronald reagan bob dole and many other top political people and campaigns didn't know manafort was the head of the mob what about comey and crooked hillary and all of the others very unfair the democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda any immigration bill must have full funding for the wall end catch  release visa lottery and chain and go to merit based immigration go for it win donald trump was 100percent right to fire james comey mark levin why in the world didn't barack obama fire this guy comey asks mark levin wow the highest rated by far morning show  is on the front lawn of the white house maybe i'll have to take an unannounced trip down to see them usa jobs numbers are the best in 44 years if my opponent the democrats had won the election they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations the economy and jobs would have been a disaster thank you for all of the compliments on getting the world cup to come to the usa mexico and canada i worked hard on this along with a great team of talented people we never fail and it will be a great world cup a special thanks to bob kraft for excellent advice the ig report is a total disaster for comey his minions and sadly the fbi comey will now officially go down as the worst leader by far in the history of the fbi i did a great service to the people in firing him good instincts christopher wray will bring it proudly back fbi agent peter strzok who headed the clinton  russia investigations texted to his lover lisa page in the ig report that we'll stop candidate trump from becoming president doesn't get any lower than that happy 🇺🇸  happy 243rd birthday to the  thank you for your bravery sacrifices and dedication to the usa we love you  schneiderman who ran the clinton campaign in new york never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case which lingered in their office for almost 2 years now he resigned his office in disgrace and his disciples brought it when we would not settle the sleazy new york democrats and their now disgraced and run out of town ag eric schneiderman are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18800000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in $19200000 i won't settle this case so the democrats make up a phony crime collusion with the russians pay a fortune to make the crime sound

we must put the american worker first great to be in singapore excitement in the air germany pays 1percent slowly of gdp towards nato while we pay 4percent of a much larger gdp does anybody believe that makes sense we protect europe which is good at great financial loss and then get unfairly clobbered on trade change is coming and add to that the fact that the us pays close to the entire cost of nato-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on trade they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh the european union had a $151 billion surplus-should pay much more for military why should i as president of the united states allow countries to continue to make massive trade surpluses as they have for decades while our farmers workers  taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay not fair to the people of america $800 billion trade deficit fair trade is now to be called fool trade if it is not reciprocal according to a canada release they make almost 100 billion dollars in trade with us guess they were bragging and got caught minimum is 17b tax dairy from us at 270percent then justin acts hurt when called out pm justin trudeau of canada acted so meek and mild during our  meetings only to give a news conference after i left saying that us tariffs were kind of insulting and he will not be pushed around very dishonest  weak our tariffs are in response to his of 270percent on dairy based on justin's false statements at his news conference and the fact that canada is charging massive tariffs to our us farmers workers and companies i have instructed our us reps not to endorse the communique as we look at tariffs on automobiles flooding the us market create peace and great prosperity for his land i look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity will not be wasted i am on my way to singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for north korea and the world it will certainly be an exciting day and i know that kim jong-un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before the united states will not allow other countries to impose massive tariffs and trade barriers on its farmers workers and companies while sending their product into our country tax free we have put up with trade abuse for many decades  and that is long enough usa trade they fully understand where i am coming from after many decades fair and reciprocal trade will happen just left the  summit in beautiful canada great meetings and relationships with the six country leaders especially since they know i cannot allow them to apply large tariffs and strong barriers to just met the new prime minister of italy  a really great guy he will be honored in washington at the  shortly he will do a great job the

farmers obama schumer and pelosi did nothing about north korea and now weak on crime high tax schumer is telling me what to do at the summit the dems could never set up schumer failed with north korea and iran we don't need his advice why isn't the european union and canada informing the public that for years they have used massive trade tariffs and non-monetary trade barriers against the us totally unfair to our farmers workers  companies take down your tariffs  barriers or we will more than match you prime minister trudeau is being so indignant bringing up the relationship that the us and canada had over the many years and all sorts of other thingsbut he doesn't bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300percent on dairy  hurting our farmers killing our agriculture please tell

political pundits just don't get what is going on out there or they do get it but refuse to report the facts remember dems are high tax high crime easy to beat four reporters spotted melania in the white house last week walking merrily along to a meeting they never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world was really ill

death to facelift to left the wh and me for ny or virginia to abuse all fake she is doing really well gold star father ceejay metcalf whose great son michael was just honored at the white house was

maybe the democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of high crime and high taxes we need border security the greatest witch hunt in political history this is a level of criminality beyond the pale this is such a grave abuse of power and authority it's like nothing else we've seen in our history this makes the nixon watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff chris farrell judicial watch they were running an operation to undermine a candidate for president of the us these are all violations of law this is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election there's nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system great interview by  with chris farrell of judicial watch concerning the governments counter-intelligence operation into the trump campaign spygate at the highest level who would believe wow strzok-page the incompetent  corrupt fbi lovers have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the trump campaign dating way back to december 2015 spygate is in full force is the mainstream media interested yet big stuff imagine how much wasteful spending we'd save if we didn't have chuck and nancy standing in our way for years democrats in congress have depleted our military and busted our budgets on needless spending and to what end no more the historic rescissions package we've proposed would cut $15000000000 in wasteful spending we are getting our government back on track terrific new book out by the wonderful harris faulkner 9 rules of engagement harris shares lessons from a military family

the wall  and champion  were recently at the white house it was a great day for a great sport meeting in singapore with north korea will hopefully be the start of something bigwe will soon see the russian witch hunt hoax continues all because jeff sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himselfi would have quickly picked someone else so much time and money wasted so many lives ruinedand sessions knew better than most that there was no collusion we have had many championship teams recently at the white house including the chicago cubs houston astros pittsburgh penguins new england patriots alabama and clemson national champions and many others national anthem  more great music today at 3:00 pm we will proudly be playing the national anthem and other wonderful music celebrating

of more than 7 trillion dollars since the election may be the best economy in the history of our country record jobs numbers nice what is taking so long with the inspector general's report on crooked hillary and slippery james comey numerous delays hope report is not being changed and made weaker there are so many horrible things to tell the public has the right to know transparency the philadelphia eagles football team was invited to the white house unfortunately only a small number of players decided to come and we canceled the event staying in the locker room for the playing of our national anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling sorry big supreme court ruling for baker just out in many ways this is the greatest economy in the history of america and the best time ever to look for a job the fake news media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony russian witch hunt  of american greatness   the appointment of the special counsel is totally unconstitutional despite that we play the game because i unlike the democrats have done nothing wrong farmers have not been doing well for 15 years mexico canada china and others have treated them unfairly by the time i finish trade talks that will change big trade barriers against us farmers and other businesses will finally be broken massive trade deficits no longer the us has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only win china already charges a tax of 16percent on soybeans canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our agricultural products not acceptable as has been stated by numerous legal scholars i have the absolute right to pardon myself but why would i do that when i have done nothing wrong in the meantime the never ending witch hunt led by 13 very angry and conflicted democrats  others continues into the mid-terms this is the best time ever to look for a job james freeman of wsj we had repeal  replace done and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars except for one person but it is getting done anyway individual mandate is gone and great less expensive plans will be announced this month drug prices coming down  right to try this is my 500th day in office and we have accomplished a lot many believe more than any president in his first 500 days massive tax  regulation cuts military  vets lower crime  illegal immigration stronger borders judgeships best economy  jobs ever and much more the appointment of the special councel is totally unconstitutional despite that we play the game because i unlike the democrats have done nothing wrong mark penn  why are there people from the clinton foundation on the mueller staff why is there an independent counsel to go after people and their families for unrelated offensesconstitution was set up to prevent thisstormtrooper tactics almost a disgrace paul manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time he represented ronald reagan bob dole  many others over the years but we should have been told that comey and the boys were doing a number on him and he wouldn't have been hired as only one of two people left who could become president why wouldn't the fbi or department of justice have told me that they were secretly investigating paul manafort on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped during my campaign should have told me jesse watters the only thing trump obstructed was hillary getting to the white house  so true mark penn  why are there people from the clinton foundation on the mueller staff why is there an independent councel to go after people and their families for unrelated offensesconstitution was set up to prevent thisstormtrooper tactics almost a disgrace when you're almost 800 billion dollars a year down on trade you can't lose a trade war the us has been ripped off by other countries for years on trade time to get smart why is it that the wall street journal though well meaning never mentions the unfairness of the tariffs routinely charged against the us by other countries or the many billions of dollars that the tariffs we are now charging are and will be pouring into us coffers the united states must at long last be treated fairly on trade if we charge a country zero to sell their goods and they charge us 25 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours it is unfair and can no longer be tolerated that is not free or fair trade it is stupid trade there was no collusion with russia except by the democrats when will this very expensive witch hunt hoax ever end so bad for our country is the special counsel/justice department leaking my lawyers letters to the fake news media should be looking at dems corruption instead real  is doing great fake news cnn is dead  very surprised that china would be doing this  now this is a record that will never be broken  $17 million spent it's a scam investigation americans are being worked we now know there was russian collusion with russians and the democrats the mueller team is stacked with anti-trumpers who actually represented clinton people  gave $'s to crooked h dan bongino john brennan no single figure in american history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar not only is he a liar he's a liar about being a liar  dan bongino on  john brennan no single figure in american history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar he's a liar about being a liar we ran out of words to describe how good the jobs numbers are  neil irwin of the  there was no collusion with russia except by the democrats when will this very expensive witch hunt hoax ever end so bad for our country is the special councel/justice department leaking my lawyers letters to the fake news media should be looking at dems corruption instead today it was my great honor to be with the brave men and women of the united states coast guard  canada has treated our agricultural business and farmers very poorly for a very long period of time highly restrictive on trade they must open their markets and take down their trade barriers they report a really high surplus on trade with us do timber  lumber in us looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 8:30 this morning why aren't they firing no talent samantha bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show a total double standard but that's ok we are winning and will be doing so for a long time to come ap has just reported that the russian hoax investigation has now cost our government over $17 million and going up fast no collusion except by the democrats fair trade will be giving a full pardon to dinesh d'souza today he was treated very unfairly by our government very good meetings with north korea not that it matters but i never fired james comey because of russia the corrupt mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative but they know it is not true the corrupt mainstream media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people spies informants into my campaign surveillance much iger where is my call of apology you and abc have offended millions of people and they demand a response how is brian ross doing he tanked the market with an abc lie yet no apology double standard rush limbaugh  if the fbi was so concerned and if they weren't targeting trump they should have told trump if they were really concerned about the russians infiltrating a campaign hoax then why not try to stop it why not tell trump because they were pushing this scam the recusal of jeff sessions was an unforced betrayal of the president of the united states joe digenova former us attorney the soon to be released book the russia hoax the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump written by gregg jarrett looks like a real deal big hit the phony witch hunt will be opened up for the world to see out in 5 weeks very importantly  will win for the republicans in novemberand his opponent will not remember alabama we can't take any chances on losing to a nancy pelosi controlled democrat there is no one better to represent the people of ny and staten island a place i know very well than  who is strong on borders  crime loves our military  our vets voted for tax cuts and is helping me to make america great again dan has my full endorsement great meeting with  today talked about prison reform and sentencing  moments ago it was my great honor to sign  into law   with the  law i signed today patients with life threatening illnesses will finally have access to experimental treatments that could improve or even cure their conditions these are experimental treatments and products that have shown great promise  today i am proud to keep another promise to the american people as i sign the  legislation into law  bob iger of abc called valerie jarrett to let her know that abc does not tolerate comments like those made by roseanne barr gee he never called president donald j trump to apologize for the horrible statements made and said about me on abc maybe i just didn't get the call the failing and corrupt  estimated the crowd last night at 1000 people when in fact it was many times that number and the arena was rockin' this is the way they demean and disparage they are very dishonest people who don't get me and never did there are lots of really good lawyers in the country he could have picked somebody else and i wish i did chief law enforcement officer and they told me later ‘oh by the way i'm not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office i would be frustrated tooand that's how i read that senator sessions why didn't you tell me before i picked you reptrey gowdy i don't think so i think what the president is doing is expressing frustration that attorney general sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job not afterward if i were the president and i picked someone to be the country's the fake mainstream media has from the time i announced i was running for president run the most highly sophisticated  dishonest disinformation campaign in the history of politics no matter how well we do they find fault but the forgotten men  women won i'm president sorry i've got to start focusing my energy on north korea nuclear bad trade deals va choice the economy rebuilding the military and so much more and not on the rigged russia witch hunt that should be investigating clinton/russia/fbi/justice/obama/comey/lynch etc why aren't the 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats investigating the totally crooked campaign of totally crooked hillary clinton it's a rigged witch hunt that's why ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration the 13 angry democrats plus people who worked 8 years for obama working on the rigged russia witch hunt will be meddling with the mid-term elections especially now that republicans stay tough are taking the lead in polls there was no collusion except by the democrats this investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about it wasn't just a wiretap against a campaign aideit was secretly gathering information on the trump campaignpeople call that spyingthis is unprecedented and  scandalous mollie hemingway we have put a great team together for our talks with north korea meetings are currently taking place concerning summit and more kim young chol the vice chairman of north korea heading now to new york solid response to my letter thank you democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from obama's term showing children from the border in steel cages they thought it was recent pictures in

crime high tax problems along with so many others on june 5th vote for gop gubernatorial candidate john cox a really good and highly competent man he'll make california great again a democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to repeal the gop tax cuts no chance this is too good to be true for republicansremember the nancy pelosi dems are also weak on crime the border and want to be gentle and kind to ms-13 gang membersnot good our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny they saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served they cared for their families more than anything in the world they loved their families they inspired their communities  the heroes who rest in these hallowed fields in cemeteries battlefields and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of american life they came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies from privilege and from poverty  thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance we are gathered here on the sacred soil of  cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of america's greatest heroes the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom   we now find out that the obama administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate or his campaign under investigation that raises legitimate questions i just find this really oddthis goes to the heart of our electoral system jonathan turley on  sally yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the justice dept i find her actions to be really quite unbelievable jonathan turley the president deserves some answers  in discussing spygate happy memorial day those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today best economy in decades lowest unemployment numbers for blacks and hispanics ever  women in 18years rebuilding our military and so much more nice 🇺🇸  why didn't president obama do something about the so-called russian meddling when he was told about it by the fbi before the election because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didn't want to upset the apple cart he was in charge not me and did nothing our united states team has arrived in north korea to make arrangements for the summit between kim jong un and myself i truly believe north korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial nation one day kim jong un agrees with me on this it will happen why didn't the 13 angry democrats investigate the campaign of crooked hillary clinton many crimes much collusion with russia why didn't the fbi take the server from the dnc  rigged investigation fantastic to have 400000 great men  women of rolling thunder in dc showing their patriotism they love our country they love our flag they stand for our national anthem thanks to executive director artie muller who's going to give back the young and beautiful lives and others that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony russia collusion witch hunt they journeyed down to washington dc with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nationthey went back home in tatters welcome home josh  when will the 13 angry democrats  those who worked for president o reveal their disqualifying conflicts of interest it's been a long time now will they be indelibly written into the report along with the fact that the only collusion is with the dems justice fbi  russia this whole russia probe is rigged just an excuse as to why the dems and crooked hillary lost the election and states that haven't been lost in decades 13 angry democrats and all dems if you include the people who worked for obama for 8 years   conflicts of interest with spies or informants as the democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister but it's not all over my campaign even from a very early date why didn't the crooked highest levels of the fbi or justice contact me to tell me of the  phony russia problem the failing  quotes a senior white house official who doesn't exist as saying even if the meeting were reinstated holding it on june 12 would be impossible given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed wrong again use real people not phony sources unlike what the failing and corrupt new york times would like people to believe there is zero disagreement within the trump administration as to  how to deal with north koreaand if there was it wouldn't matter the  has called me wrong right from the beginning thanks to very brave teacher  hero jason seaman of noblesville indiana for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives his quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world looking forward to seeing joshua holt this evening in the white house the

this evening and be in the white house with his family at about 7:00 pm the great people of utah will be very happy we are having very productive talks with north korea about reinstating the summit which if it does happen will likely remain in singapore on the same date june 12th and if necessary will be extended beyond that date but complain and obstruct they made only bad deals iran and their so-called trade deals are the laughing stock of the world senator schumer and obama administration let phone company zte flourish with no security checks i closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees change of management and board must purchase us parts and pay a $13 billion fine dems do nothing funny to watch the democrats criticize trade deals being negotiated by me when they don't even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the obama administration did nothing on trade except let other countries rip off the united states lost almost $800 billion/year under o chicago police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won't let them do their job the killings are at a record pace and tough police work which chicago

productive statement from north korea we will soon see where it will lead hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace only time and talent will tell democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with north korea just like they are coming to the defense of ms 13 thugs saying that they are individuals  must be nurtured or asking to end your big tax cuts  raise your taxes instead dems have lost touch everyone knows there was a spy and in fact the people who were involved in the spying are admitting that there was a spywidespread spying involving multiple people mollie hemingway the federalist senior editor  but the corrupt mainstream media hates this monster story can anyone even imagine having spies placed in a competing campaign by the people and party in absolute power for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain and to think that the party in question even with the expenditure of far more money lost the democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing party's campaign is different than having a spy as illegal as that may be but what about an informant who is paid a fortune and who sets up way earlier than the russian hoax i will be making the commencment address today at the united states naval academy in annapolis maryland look forward to being with some of the greatest people on earth today it was my great honor to present the  to  seal master chief special warfare operator britt slabinski in the east room of the  full ceremony   today it was my honor to sign  the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act read more   i have decided to terminate the planned summit in singapore on june 12th while many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially i believe that this is a tremendous setback for north korea and indeed a setback for the world  it was my great honor to host a roundtable re ms-13 yesterday in bethpage new york democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can support law enforcement and save innocent lives  sadly i was forced to cancel the summit meeting in singapore with kim jong un  not surprisingly the great men  women of the fbi are starting to speak out against comey mccabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the fbi comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the fbi  clapper has now admitted that there was spying in my campaign large dollars were paid to the spy far beyond normal starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in us history spygate a terrible thing sadly i was forced to cancel the summit meeting in singapore with kim jung un  will be interviewed on  tomorrow morning at 6:00 am enjoy great to be in new york for the day heading back to the  now lots of work to be done  thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in bethpage new york keep up the great work  crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled ms-13 gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities and democrats in congress refuse to close these loopholes including the disgraceful practice known as catch-and-release democrats must abandon their resistance  today on long island we were all moved to be joined by families who have suffered unthinkable heartbreak at the hands of ms-13 i was truly honored to be joined again by the courageous families who were my guests at the state of the union  thank you    witch hunt there will be big news coming soon for our great american autoworkers after many decades of losing your jobs to other countries you have waited long enough big legislation will be signed by me shortly after many years right to try and big changes to dodd frank our trade deal with china is moving along nicely but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion trump should be happy that the fbi was spying on his campaign no james clapper i am not happy spying on a campaign would be illegal and a scandal to boot everybody is with tomi lahren a truly outstanding and respected young woman  spygate could be one of the biggest political scandals in history it's clear that they had eyes and ears all over the trump campaign judge andrew napolitano look how things have turned around on the criminal deep state they go after phony collusion with russia a made up scam and end up getting caught in a major spy scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before what goes around comes around   new bombshell in the obama spying scandal did other agencies spy on trump campaign even clapper worlds dumbest former intelligence head who has the problem of lying a lot used the word spy when describing the illegal activities follow the money the spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported collusion with russia because there was no collusion he was only there to spy for political reasons and to help crooked hillary win just like they did to bernie sanders who got duped if the person placed very early into my campaign wasn't a spy put there by the previous administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered many times higher than normal for the first time since roe v wade america has a pro-life president a pro-life vice president a pro-life house of representatives and 25 pro-life republican state capitals  it was my honor to welcome  cup series champion  and his team to the  yesterday  today it was my great honor to welcome president moon jae-in of the republic of korea to the 🇺🇸🇰🇷   the great governor of arkansas is in a primary tomorrow he has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes border security and crime prevention asa loves our military and our veterans i fully endorse asa for governor under our potential deal with china they will purchase from our great american farmers practically as much as our farmers can produce the wall street journal asks where in the world was barack obama  a very good question they then used to start an investigation about trump it is that simple this guy is the genesis of this whole debacle this was a political hit job this was not an intelligence investigation brennan has disgraced himself he's worried about staying out of jail dan bongino top of the fbi brennan started this entire debacle about president trump we now know that brennan had detailed knowledge of the phony dossierhe knows about the dossier he denies knowledge of the dossier he briefs the gang of 8 on the hill about the dossier which john brennan is panicking he has disgraced himself he has disgraced the country he has disgraced the entire intelligence community he is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of american's faith in the intelligence community and in some people at the china must continue to be strong  tight on the border of north korea until a deal is made the word is that recently the border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in i want this to happen and north korea to be very successful but only after signing on china barriers and tariffs to come down for first time china has agreed to buy massive amounts of additional farm/agricultural products would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years i ask senator chuck schumer why didn't president obama  the democrats do something about trade with china including theft of intellectual property etc they did nothing with that being said chuck  i have long agreed on this issue fair trade plus with china will happen i hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the department of justice look into whether or not the fbi/doj infiltrated or surveilled the trump campaign for political purposes and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the obama administration the witch hunt finds no collusion with russia so now they're looking at the rest of the world oh' great and why hasn't the podesta brother been charged and arrested like others after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm is it because he is a very well connected democrat working in the swamp of washington dc what ever happened to the server at the center of so much corruption that the democratic national committee refused to hand over to the hard charging except in the case of democrats fbi they broke into homes  offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the server now that the witch hunt has given up on russia and is looking at the rest of the world they should easily be able to take it into the mid-term elections where they can put some hurt on the republican party don't worry about dems fisa abuse missing emails or fraudulent dossier in the hillary clinton campaign where she deleted 33000 emails got $145000000 while secretary of state paid mccabes wife $700000 and got off the fbi hook along with terry m and so much more republicans and real americans should start getting tough on this scam at what point does this soon to be $20000000 witch hunt composed of 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats and two people who have worked for obama for 8 years stop they have found no collussion with russia no obstruction but they aren't looking at the corruption things are really getting ridiculous the failing and crooked but not as crooked as hillary clinton  has done a long  boring story indicating that the world's most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia  me so now they are looking at the rest of the world if the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal only the release or review of documents that the house intelligence committee also senate judiciary is asking for can give the conclusive answers drain the swamp great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house melania is feeling and doing really well thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes happy  to our great military men and women for their selfless service to our nation  great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house melanie is feeling and doing really well thank you

life and send our support and love to everyone affected by this horrible attack in texas to the students families teachers and personnel at santa fe high school  we are with you in this tragic hour and we will be with you forever  school shooting in texas early reports not looking good god bless all reports are there was indeed at least one fbi representative implanted for political purposes into my campaign for president it took place very early on and long before the phony russia hoax became a hot fake news story if true all time biggest political scandal why isn't disgraced fbi official andrew mccabe being investigated for the $700000 crooked hillary democrats in virginia led by clinton best friend terry m under fbi investigation that they killed gave to mccabe's wife in her run for office then dropped case on clinton fake news media had me calling immigrants or illegal immigrants animals wrong they were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories i referred to ms 13 gang members as animals a big difference and so true fake news got it purposely wrong as usual apparently the doj put a spy in the trump campaign this has never been done before and by any means necessary they are out to frame donald trump for crimes he didn't commit  david asman      really bad stuff it was my great honor to visit with our heroes last night at walter reed medical center

and unwarranted witch hunt we have had the most successful first 17 month administration in us history by far sorry to the fake news media and haters but that's the way it is wow word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi spied on the trump campaign with an embedded informant andrew mccarthy says there's probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign if so this is bigger than watergate wow word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi spied on the trump campaign with an imbedded informant andrew mccarthy says there's probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign if so this is bigger than watergate congratulations america we are now into the second year of the greatest witch hunt in american historyand there

cut bill he's also weak on borders and crime sadly our great military and vets mean nothing to bobby jr lou barletta will win  lou barletta will be a great senator for pennsylvania but his opponent

middle east by whatever means necessary now that will not happen china and the united states are working well together on trade but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of china for so

zte a way to get back into business fast too many jobs in china lost commerce department has been instructed to get it done happy mother's day  the senate should get funding done before the august

news to create ill will james comey's memos are classified i did not declassify them they belong to our government therefore he broke the law additionally he totally made up many of the things he said i said and he is already a proven liar and leaker where are memos on clinton lynch  others sylvester stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion jack johnson his trials and tribulations were great his life complex and controversial others have looked at this over the years most thought it would be done but yes i am considering a full pardon so funny the democrats have

based on an illegal act really does everybody know what that means just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist democrats this can be good news in that we will now counter for the dnc server that they refused to give to the fbi the debbie wasserman schultz servers and documents held by the pakistani mystery man and clinton emails north korea has agreed to suspend all nuclear tests and close up a major test site this is very good news for north korea and the world big progress look forward to our summit can you believe that despite 93percent bad stories from the fake news media

lots of money from a third rate book that should never have been written is that really the way life in america is supposed to work i don't think so james comey memos just out and show clearly that there was no collusion and no obstruction also he leaked classified information wow will the witch hunt continue james comey just threw andrew mccabe under the bus inspector general's report on mccabe is a disaster for both of them getting a little lot of their own medicine sanctuary cities released at least 142 gang members across the united states making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed we are doing a great job of law enforcement but things such as this make safety in america difficult my thoughts prayers and condolences are with the families friends and colleagues of the two  deputies heroes who lost their lives in the line of duty today mike pompeo is outstanding first in his class at west point a top student at harvard law school a success at whatever he has done we need the senate to approve mike asap he will be a great secretary of state hopefully the senate will not leave washington until our ambassadors judges and the people who make washington work are approved the democrats are obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our country democrats are obstructing good hopefully great people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our government hence the american people they are slow walking all of my nominations hundreds of people at this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals  is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her great on the military border security and crime loves and works hard for the people of tennessee she has

have no better friends anywhere looking forward to moving our embassy to jerusalem next month  melania and i join the nation in celebrating the life of barbara bush  slippery james comey the worst fbi director in history was not fired because of the phony russia investigation where by the way there was no collusion except by the dems mike pompeo met with kim jong un in north korea last week meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed details of summit are being worked out now denuclearization will be a great thing for world but also for north korea a sketch years later about a nonexistent man a total con job playing the fake news media for fools but they know it  there is a revolution going on in california soooo many sanctuary areas want out of this ridiculous crime infested  breeding concept jerry brown is trying to back out of the national guard at the border but the people of the state are not happy want security  safety now while japan and south korea would like us to go back into tpp i don't like the deal for the united states too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn't work bilateral deals are far more efficient profitable and better for our workers look how bad wto is to us pastor andrew brunson a fine gentleman and christian leader in the united states is on trial and being persecuted in turkey for no reason they call him a spy but i am more a spy than he is hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs it is my great honor to host     melania and i join the nation in celebrating the life of barbara bush  states and cities throughout our country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers very unfair to traditional tax paying stores congress  house and senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society keep america safe today's court decision means that congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens including aggravated felons this is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by welcome prime minister abe  rasmussen just came out at 51percent approval despite the fake news media they were one of the three most accurate on election day just about the most inaccurate were cnn and abc news/washington post and they haven't changed get new pollsters much of the media is a scam getting ready to meet prime minister abe of japan a truly fine gentleman so many people are seeing the benefits of the tax cut bill everyone is talking really nice to see looks like jerry brown and california are not looking for safety and security along their very porous border he cannot come to terms for the national guard to patrol and protect the border the high crime rate will only get higher much wanted wall in san diego already started i am in florida and looking forward to my meeting with prime minister abe of japan working on trade and military security employment is up taxes are down enjoy russia and china are playing the currency devaluation game as the us keeps raising interest rates not acceptable comey drafted the crooked hillary exoneration long before he talked to her lied in congress to senator g then based his decisions on her poll numbers disgruntled he mccabe and the others committed many crimes just hit 50percent in the rasmussen poll much higher than president obama at same point with all of the phony stories and fake news it's hard to believe thank you america we are doing great things slippery james comey a man who always ends up badly and out of whack he is not smart will go down as the worst fbi director in history by far attorney client privilege is now a thing of the past i have many too many lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices and even homes are going to be raided with everything including their phones and computers taken all lawyers are deflated and concerned i never asked comey for personal loyalty i hardly even knew this guy just another of his many lies his memos are self serving and fake the syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the fake news media could demean was by my use of the term mission accomplished i knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great military term it should be brought back use often comey throws ag lynch under the bus why can't we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with wild bill and lynch was she promised a supreme court seat or ag in order to lay off hillary no golf and grandkids talk give us all a break the big questions in comey's badly reviewed book aren't answered like how come he gave up classified information jail why did he lie to congress jail why did the dnc refuse to give server to the fbi why didn't they take it why the phony memos mccabe's $700000  more unbelievably james comey states that polls where crooked hillary was leading were a factor in the handling stupidly of the clinton email probe in other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job slimeball so proud of our great military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the finest that our country has ever had there won't be anything or anyone even close a perfectly executed strike last night thank you to france and the united kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine military could not have had a better result mission accomplished doj just issued the mccabe report which is a total disaster he lied lied lied mccabe was totally controlled by comey mccabe is comey no collusion all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes we are bringing back our factories we are bringing back our jobs and we are bringing back those four beautiful words made in the usa  untruthful slime ball who was as time has proven a terrible director of the fbi his handling of the crooked hillary clinton case and the events surrounding it will go down as one of the worst botch jobs of history it was my great honor to fire james comey james comey is a proven leaker  liar virtually everyone in washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was in fact fired he leaked classified information for which he should be prosecuted he lied to congress under oath he is a weak and tremendous pressure is building like never before for the border wall and an end to crime cradling sanctuary cities started the wall in san diego where the people were pushing really hard to get it they will soon be protected would only join tpp if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to pres obama we already have bilateral deals with six of the eleven nations in tpp and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those  nations japan who has hit us hard on trade for years america's greatest treasure is our people  and my administration hears your voice and has your back we are fighting to give every american a future of dignity purpose and pride american spirit is back   thank you to all of the american workers who travelled here today this event is dedicated to you the hardworking americans who make this nation run you love your country you provide for your family you have pride in your work and you cherish our great american flag   i have agreed with the historically cooperative disciplined approach that we have engaged in with robert mueller unlike the clintons i have full confidence in ty cobb my special counsel and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process on yom hashoah we remember the six million jews slaughtered in the holocaust with each passing year our duty to remember this atrocity increases as we pledge    good luck to mike pompeo during his confirmation hearing today he will be a great secretary of state never said when an attack on syria would take place could be very soon or not so soon at

ellipse beginning tomorrow april 12th to april 18th more information   speaker paul ryan is a truly good man and while he will not be seeking re-election he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question we are with you paul much of the bad blood with russia is caused by the fake  corrupt russia investigation headed up by the all democrat loyalists or people that worked for obama mueller is most conflicted of all except rosenstein who signed fisa  comey letter no collusion so they go crazy our relationship with russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the cold war there is no reason for this russia needs us to help with their economy something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together stop the arms race russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at syria get ready russia  because they will be coming nice and new and smart you shouldn't be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it doing things that nobody thought possible despite the never ending and corrupt russia investigation which takes tremendous time and focus no collusion or obstruction other than i fight back so now they do the unthinkable and raid a lawyers office for information bad so much fake news about what is going on in the white house very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with china the coming north korea meeting and of course the vicious gas attack in syria feels great to have bolton  larry k on board i we are the failing new york times wrote another phony story it was

states there is a tariff to be paid of 25percent does that sound like free or fair trade  no it sounds like stupid trade  going on for years congratulations to patrick reed on his great and courageous masters win when patrick had his amazing win at doral 5 years ago people saw his great talent and a bright future ahead now he is the masters champion if president obama had crossed his stated red

names many of which don't exist story on john kelly isn't truejust another hit job the fbi closed the case on hillary which was a rigged investigation they exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her they never even put her under oath and much more so true jesse  while security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor scott pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at epa record clean air  water while saving usa billions of dollars rent was about market rate travel expenses ok scott is doing a great job fire at trump tower is out very confined well built building firemen and women did a great job thank you what does the department of justice and fbi have to hide why aren't they giving the strongly requested documents unredacted to the house judiciary committee stalling but for what reason not looking good lawmakers of the house judiciary committee are angrily accusing the department of justice of missing the thursday deadline for turning over unredacted documents relating to fisa abuse fbi comey lynch mccabe clinton emails and much more slow walking what is going on bad we are sealing up our southern border the people of our great country want safety and security the dems have been a disaster on this very important issue the united states hasn't had a trade surplus with china in 40 years they must end unfair trade take down

to replace ag jeff sessions with epa chief scott pruitt who is doing a great job but is totally under siege do people really believe this stuff so much of the media is dishonest and corrupt china which is a great economic power is considered a developing nation within the world trade organization they therefore get tremendous perks and advantages especially over the us does anybody think this is fair we were badly represented the wto is unfair to us despite the aluminum tariffs aluminum prices are down 4percent people are surprised i'm not lots of money coming into us coffers and jobs jobs jobs thank you  jim justice it was my great honor to be with the amazing people of west virginia today   thanks to our historic tax cuts america is open for business and millions of american workers are seeing more take-home pay through higher wages salaries and bonuses  the fake news washington post amazon's chief lobbyist has another of many phony headlines trump defiant as china adds trade penalties wrong should read trump defiant as us adds trade penalties will end barriers and massive  ip theft typically bad reporting the caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our border because of the trump administrations actions border crossings are at a still unacceptable 46 year low stop drugs still rising rasmussen poll shows donald trump approval ratings now at 51 percent  today we honor dr martin luther king jr on the 50th anniversary of his assassination earlier this year i spoke about dr king's legacy of justice and peace and his impact on uniting americans  proclamation   our thoughts and prayers are with the four us marines from the 3rd marine aircraft wing who lost their lives in yesterday's southern california helicopter crash we pray for their families and our great  when you're already $500 billion down you can't lose we are not in a trade war with china that war was lost many years ago by the foolish or incompetent people who represented the us now we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year with intellectual property theft of another $300 billion we cannot let this continue our border laws are very weak while those of mexico  canada are very strong congress must change these obama era and other laws now the democrats stand in our way they want people to pour into our country uncheckedcrime we will be taking strong action today was just briefed on the shooting at youtube's hq in san bruno california our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved thank you to our phenomenal law enforcement officers and first responders that are currently on the scene we will protect our southern border  today it was my honor to welcome estonia president  lithuania president  and latvia president  to the  congratulations on your 100th anniversaries of independence    i am right about amazon costing the united states post office massive amounts of money for being their delivery boy amazon should pay these costs plus and not have them bourne by the american taxpayer many billions of dollars po leaders don't have a clue or do they thank you to rasmussen for the honest polling just hit 50percent which is higher than cheatin' obama at the same time in his administration check out the fact that you can't get a job at ratings challenged  unless you state that you are totally anti-trump little jeff zuker whose job is in jeopardy is not having much fun lately they should clean up and strengthen cnn and get back to honest reporting the big caravan of people from honduras now coming across mexico and heading to our weak laws border had better be stopped before it gets there cash cow nafta is in play as is foreign aid to honduras and the countries that allow this to happen congress must act now the fake news networks those that knowingly have a sick and biased agenda are worried about the competition and quality of sinclair broadcast the fakers at cnn nbc abc  cbs have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction    president trump's approval rate among likely us voters hit 50 percent on monday which puts him higher than former president barack obama's score at the same point into his first term according to a new poll via    39percent of my nominations including diplomats to foreign lands have not been confirmed due to democrat obstruction and delay at this rate it would take more than 7 years before i am allowed to have these great people start working never happened before disgraceful honduras mexico and many other countries that the us is very generous to sends many of their people to our country through our weak immigration policies caravans are heading here must pass tough laws and build the wall democrats allow open borders drugs and crime as ridiculous as it sounds the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our southern border back where they came from a whole big wasted procedure must take place mexico  canada have tough immigration laws whereas ours are an obama joke act congress president donald j trump proclaims april 2 2018 world autism awareness day  an honor to host the annual  easter egg roll  so sad that the department of justice and the fbi are slow walking or even not giving the unredacted documents requested by congress an embarrassment to our country only fools or worse are saying that our money losing post office makes money with amazon they lose a fortune and this will be changed also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the countrynot a level playing field so funny to watch fake news networks among the most dishonest groups of people i have ever dealt with criticize sinclair broadcasting for being biased sinclair is far superior to cnn and even more fake nbc which is a total joke mexico is making a fortune on naftathey have very strong border laws ours are pathetic with all of the money they make from the us hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until congress changes our immigration laws daca is dead because the democrats didn't care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the daca bandwagon no longer works must build wall and secure our borders with proper border legislation democrats want no borders hence drugs and crime congress must immediately pass border legislation use nuclear option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of drugs and people border patrol agents and ice are great but the weak dem laws don't allow them to do their job act now congress our country is being stolen mexico has the absolute power not to let these large caravans of people enter their country they must stop them at their northern border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws these big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of daca they want in on the act mexico is doing very little if not nothing at stopping people from flowing into mexico through their southern border and then into the us they laugh at our dumb immigration laws they must stop the big drug and people flows or i will stop their cash cow nafta need wall border patrol agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the border because of ridiculous liberal democrat laws like catch  release getting more dangerous caravans coming republicans must go to nuclear option to pass tough laws now no more daca deal happy easter governor jerry moonbeam brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include 1 kidnapping and robbery 2 badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize 3 dealing drugs is this really what the great people of california want  does not include the fake washington post which is used as a lobbyist and should so  register if the po increased its parcel rates amazon's shipping costs would rise by $26 billion this post office scam must stop amazon must pay real costs and taxes now while we are on the subject it is reported that the us post office will lose $150 on average for each package it delivers for amazon that amounts to billions of dollars the failing ny times reports that the size of the company's lobbying staff has ballooned and that washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair no more it's time to rebuild and we will do it with american workers american grit and american pride  jobs jobs jobs unemployment claims have fallen to a 45-year low together we are making the economy great again  we are going to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the great state of ohio a tremendous honor to be here today at a state-of-the-art training site where the skills of the american worker are forged and refined  i have stated my concerns with amazon long before the election unlike others they pay little or no taxes to state  local governments use our postal system as their delivery boy causing tremendous loss to the us and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business in the interim hon robert wilkie of dod will serve as acting secretary i am thankful for dr david shulkin's service to our country and to our great veterans i am pleased to announce that i intend to nominate highly respected admiral ronny l jackson md as the new

sanctuary policies california's sanctuary laws  just announced an agreement in principle with south korea on korus a great deal for american and korean workers let's now focus on our important security relationship received message last night from xi jinping of china that his meeting with kim jong un went very well and that kim looks forward to his meeting with me in the meantime and unfortunately maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost for years and through many administrations everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the korean peninsula was not even a small possibility now there is a good chance that kim jong un will do what is right for his people and for humanity look forward to our meeting the second amendment will never be repealed as much as democrats would like to see this happen and despite the words yesterday of former supreme court justice stevens no way we need more republicans in 2018 and must always hold the supreme court i am very pleased to welcome the opioid memorial to the president's park in april i encourage all to visit and remember those who we have lost to this deadly epidemic we will keep fighting until we defeat the opioid crisis  trade talks going on with numerous countries that for many years have not treated the united states fairly in the end all will be happy great news   so much fake news never been more voluminous or more inaccurate but through it all our country is doing great the economy is looking really good it has been many years that we have seen these kind of numbers the underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better  just wrote a book which everyone is talking about he was a great help he is a veteran journalist who had a great influence in nh and beyond he calls it the most amazing political campaign of modern times the book is called what really happened enjoy   president donald j trump proclaims march 25 2018 as greek independence day a national day of celebration of greek and american democracy   happy national  to our heroes we love you  lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed if for no other reason than they can bill more which is unfair to our great country and i am very happy with my existing team besides there was no collusion with russia except by crooked hillary and the dems many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the russia casedon't believe the fake news narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on fame  fortune will never be turned down by a lawyer though some are conflicted problem is that a new much can be done with the $16 billion given to building and fixing the border wall it is just a down payment work will start immediately the rest of the money will come and remember daca the democrats abandoned you but we will not because of the $700  $716 billion dollars gotten to rebuild our military many jobs are created and our military is again rich building a great border wall with drugs poison and enemy combatants pouring into our country is all about national defense build wall through m france honors a great hero officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in isis related terror attack so much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical islamic terrorism even stronger measures needed especially at borders our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in france yesterday and we grieve the nation's loss we also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support we are with you  as a matter of national security i've signed the omnibus spending bill i say to congress i will never sign another bill like this again to prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again i'm calling on congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills  obama administration legalized bump stocks bad idea as i promised today the department of justice will issue the rule banning bump stocks with a mandated comment period we will ban all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns news conference at the white house concerning the omnibus spending bill  1:00 pm i am considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on the fact that the 800000 plus daca recipients have been totally abandoned by the democrats not even mentioned in bill and the border wall which is desperately needed for our national defense is not fully funded daca was abandoned by the democrats very unfair to them would have been tied to desperately needed wall house intelligence committee votes to release final report findings 1 no evidence provided of collusion between trump campaign  russia 2  the obama administrations post election response was insufficient 3 clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts i am pleased to announce that effective 4/9/18  will be my new national security advisor i am very thankful for the service of general hr mcmaster who has done an outstanding job  will always remain my friend there will be an official contact handover on 4/9 my honor charlie thank you   as a candidate i pledged that if elected i would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade protect american workers and defend our national security  today we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment   remember when they were saying during the campaign that donald trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as crooked hillary's large and highly sophisticated staff well not saying that anymore crazy joe biden is trying to act like a tough guy actually he is weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault he doesn't know me but he would go down fast and hard crying all the way don't threaten people joe democrats refused to take care of daca would have been so easy but they just didn't care i had to fight for military and start of wall got $16 billion to start wall on southern border rest will be forthcoming most importantly got $700 billion to rebuild our military $716 billion next yearmost ever had to waste money on dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment they can help solve problems with north korea syria ukraine isis iran and even the coming arms race bush tried to get along but didn't have the smarts obama and clinton tried but didn't have the energy or chemistry remember reset peace through strength i called president putin of russia to congratulate him on his election victory in past obama called him also the fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him they are wrong getting along with russia and others is a good thing not a bad thing special council is told to find crimes whether a crime exists or not i was opposed to the selection of mueller to be special council i am still opposed to it i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council appointed because there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime collusion or otherwise or obstruction of justice  so stated by harvard law professor alan dershowitz special council is told to find crimes wether crimes exist or not i was opposed the the selection of mueller to be special council i still am opposed to it i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council appointed because department of justice should have urged the supreme court to at least hear the drivers license case on illegal immigrants in arizona i agree with  should have sought review austin bombing suspect is dead great job by law enforcement and all concerned our nation was founded by farmers our independence was won by farmers and our continent was tamed by farmers our farmers always lead the way -- we are proud of them and we are delivering for them  the democrats do not want to help daca would be so easy to make a deal a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interest  on  now great 8:18 am why does the mueller team have 13 hardened democrats some big crooked hillary supporters and zero republicans another dem recently addeddoes anyone think this is fair and yet there is no collusion spent very little time with andrew mccabe but he never took notes when he was with me i don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date same with lying james comey can we call them fake memos wow watch comey lie under oath to senator g when asked have you ever been an anonymous sourceor known someone else to be an anonymous source he said strongly never no he lied as shown clearly on  the mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime it was based on fraudulent activities and a fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc and improperly used in fisa court for surveillance of my campaign witch hunt the fake news is beside themselves that mccabe was caught called out and fired how many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife's campaign by crooked h friend terry m who was also under investigation how many lies how many leaks comey knew it all and much more as the house intelligence committee has concluded there was no collusion between russia and the trump campaign as many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the fbi justice  state  happy   andrew mccabe fired a great day for the hard working men and women of the fbi a great day for democracy sanctimonious james comey was his boss and made mccabe look like a choirboy he knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the fbi us consumer confidence hits 14-year high  it would be great for the republican party of nevada and it's unity if good guy danny tarkanian would run for congress and dean heller who is doing a really good job could run for senate unopposed our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of

more than 55000 factories 6000000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated trade deficits of more than 12 trillion dollars last year we had a trade deficit of almost 800 billion dollars bad policies  leadership must win again     from bush 1 to present our country has lost more than 55000 factories 6000000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated trade deficits of more than 12 trillion dollars last year

8 years to fix this problem and didn't i am waiting for the dems they are running for the hills lowest rated oscars in history problem is we don't have stars anymore except your president just kidding of course we will see what happens  we are getting it done jobs and security  total inaction on daca by dems where are you a deal can be made the new fake news narrative is that there is chaos in the

great energy it's march 5th and the democrats are nowhere to be found on daca gave them 6 months they just don't care where are they we are ready to make a deal why did the obama administration start an investigation into the trump campaign with zero proof of wrongdoing long before the election in november wanted to discredit so crooked h would win unprecedented bigger than watergate plus obama did nothing about russian meddling to protect our country we must protect american steel  first treat our farmers much better highly restrictive mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the us they have not done what needs to be done millions of people addicted and dying we have large trade deficits with mexico and canada nafta which is under renegotiation right now has been a bad deal for usa massive relocation of companies  jobs tariffs on steel and aluminum will only come off if new  fair nafta agreement is signed also canada must we are on the losing side of almost all trade deals our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the us for many years our steel and aluminum industries are dead sorry it's time for a change make america great again the gridiron dinner last night was great fun i am accomplishing a lot in washington and have never had a better time doing something and especially since this is for the american people if the eu wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on us companies doing business there we will simply apply a tax on their cars which freely pour into the us they make it impossible for our cars and more to sell there big trade imbalance the united states has an $800 billion dollar yearly trade deficit because of our very stupid trade deals and policies our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years they laugh at what fools our leaders have been no more mainstream media in us is being mocked all over the world they've gone crazy  happy

all of the aftermath that suggests that the president has obstructed justice because he's exercising his power as the president of the us i just don't see it  judge ken starr i've been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year i just don't see the evidencein terms of the collusion it's all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have  jonathan turley on  he's got a very good point somebody in the justice department has a treasure trove of evidence of mrs clinton's criminality at her own hands or through others that ought to be investigated i fully agree with the president on that  on  show i will be interviewed by  on  at 9:00 pm enjoy congressman schiff omitted and distorted key facts   so what else is new he is a total phony russians had no compromising information on donald trump   of course not because there is none and never was this whole witch hunt is an illegal disgraceand obama did nothing about russia dem memo fbi did not disclose who the clients were the clinton campaign and the dnc wow the democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal bust just confirms all of the terrible things that were done so illegal big cpac straw poll results 93percent approve of the job president trump is doing thank you 50percent say president trump should tweet more or same funny 79percent say republicans in

truly doesn't care about them republicans stand ready to make a deal unemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973 much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing regulations democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great state of pennsylvania  this is very unfair to republicans and to our country as a whole must be appealed to the united states supreme court asap armed educators and trusted people who work within a school love our students and will protect them very smart people must be firearms adept  have annual training

the united states  for a job well done today  melania and i were honored to welcome prime minister  and mrs turnbull of australia to the 🇺🇸🇦🇺press conference   our nation's motto is in god we trust this week our nation lost an incredible leader who devoted his life to helping us understand what those words really mean we will never forget the historic crowds the voice the energy and the profound faith of billy graham   we salute our great american flag we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance and we all proudly stand for the national anthem   after years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation and we are restoring our confidence and our pride   for those of you who are still interested the democrats have totally forgotten about daca not a lot of interest on this subject from them my daughter ivanka just arrived in south korea we cannot have a better or smarter person representing our country cpac today ms-13 gang members are being removed by our great ice and border patrol agents by the thousands but these killers come back in from el salvador and through mexico like water el salvador just takes our money and mexico must help more with this problem we need the wall school shooting survivor says he quit  town hall after refusing scripted question  just like so much of cnn fake news that's why their ratings are so bad msnbc may be worse today it was my great honor to host a school safety roundtable at the  with state and local leaders law enforcement officers and education officialsthere is nothing more important than protecting our children they deserve to be safe and we will deliver  on behalf of an entire nation congratulations to the us women's hockey team on winning the gold    will be meeting with lawmakers today at 11:30 am to discuss school safety  next week it will be with our nation's governors it's been many years of all talk no action we'll get it done what many people don't understand or don't want to understand is that wayne chris and the folks who work so hard at the  are great people and great american patriots they love our country and will do the right thing                  make america great again i will be strongly pushing comprehensive background checks with an emphasis on mental health raise age to 21 and end sale of bump stocks congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue i hope if a potential sicko shooter knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers and others who will be instantly shooting the sicko will never attack that school cowards won't go thereproblem solved must be offensive defense alone won't work history shows that a school shooting lasts on average 3 minutes it takes police  first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime highly trained gun adept teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive great deterrent immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this far more assets at much less cost than guards a gun free school is a magnet for bad people attacks would end i never said give teachers guns like was stated on fake news    what i said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience only the best 20percent of teachers a lot would now be able to i will always remember the time i spent today with courageous students teachers and families so much love in the midst of so much pain we must not let them down we must keep our children safefull listening session    melania and i join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of billy graham our prayers are with his children grandchildren great-grandchildren and all who worked closely with reverend graham in his lifelong ministry  yesterday it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary law enforcement officers and first responders and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers the medal of valor   question if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration right up to january 20th why aren't they the subject of the investigation why didn't obama do something about the meddling why aren't dem crimes under investigation ask jeff sessions the great billy graham is dead there was nobody like him he will be missed by christians and all religions a very special man question if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration right up to january 20th why aren't they the subject of the investigation why didn't obama do something about the meddling why aren't dem crimes under investigation ask jeff session   whether we are republican or democrat we must now focus on strengthening background checks so true thank you  bad ratings    got scammed when they covered the anti-trump russia rally wall-to-wall they probably knew it was fake news but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise main street is booming thanks to our incredible tax cut and reform law this shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic they are ready to grow their businesses  cameras running another false accusation why doesn't  report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me one had her home mortgage paid off only  so reporteddoesn't fit the mainstream media narrative a woman i don't know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the front page of the fake news washington post saying i kissed her for two minutes yet in the lobby of trump tower 12 years ago never happened who would do this in a public space with live security i have been much tougher on russia than obama just look at the facts total fake news hope republicans in the great state of pennsylvania challenge the new pushed congressional map all the way to the supreme court if necessary your original was correct don't let the dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes  waste money matt schlapp and cpac are getting ready for another exciting event big difference from those days when president obama held the white house you've come a long way matt republicans are now leading the generic poll perhaps because of the popular tax cuts which the dems want to take away actually they want to raise you taxes substantially also they want to do nothing on daca r's want to fix the president obama quote just before election that's because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didn't want to rock the boat when i easily won the electoral college the whole game changed and the russian excuse became the narrative of the dems there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig america's elections there's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so i'd invite mr trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes  thank you to  for the great timeline on all of the failures the obama administration had against russia including crimea syria and so much more we are now starting to win again the faith of donald trump a book just out by david brody and scott lamb is a very interesting read enjoy the us economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving the unemployment numbers are looking great and regulations  taxes have been massively cut jobs jobs jobs  has announced he is running for the senate from the wonderful state of utah he will make a great senator and worthy successor to  and has my full support and endorsement obama was president up to and beyond the 2016 election so why didn't he do something about russian meddling have a great but very reflective president's day just watched a very insecure oprah winfrey who at one point i knew very well interview a panel of people on 60 minutes the questions were biased and slanted the facts incorrect hope oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others my great friends from nascar are having their big race today the daytona 500 brian france and the france family are special people enjoy the race thank you to kenstarr former independent counsel whitewater for your insight and powerful words on fisa abuse russian meddling etc really great interview with  great pollster john mclaughlin now has the gop up in the generic congressional ballot big gain over last 4 weeks i guess people are loving the big tax cuts given them by the republicans the cuts the dems want to take away we need more republicans the fake news of big ratings loser cnn  if it was the goal of russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the us then with all of the committee hearings investigations and party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams they are laughing their asses off in moscow get smart america now that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats lead by their fearless leader crooked hillary clinton lost the 2016 election but wasn't i a great candidate i never said russia did not meddle in the election i said it may be russia or china or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer the russian hoax was that the trump campaign colluded with russia it never did finally liddle' adam schiff the leakin' monster of no control is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the 2016 election he is finally right about something obama was president knew of the threat and did nothing thank you adam never gotten over the fact that obama was able to send $17 billion dollars in cash to iran and nobody in congress the fbi or justice called for an investigation general mcmaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the russians and that the only collusion was between russia and crooked h the dnc and the dems remember the dirty dossier uranium speeches emails and the podesta company very sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter this is not acceptable they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign there is no collusion get back to the basics and make us all proud just like they don't want to solve the daca problem why didn't the democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the house  senate during the obama administration because they didn't want to and now they just talk i have seen all of the russian ads and i can say very definitively that swaying the election was *not* the main goalrob goldmanvice president of facebook ads  the fake news media never fails hard to ignore this fact from the vice president of facebook ads rob goldman  funny how the fake news media doesn't want to say that the russian group was formed in 2014 long before my run for president maybe they knew i was going to run even though i didn't know deputy ag rod rosenstein stated at the news conference there is no allegation in the indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election charges deal don a big win written by michael goodwin of the  succinctly states that the russians had no impact on the election results there was no collusion with the trump campaign she lost the old-fashioned way by being a terrible candidate case closed melania and i met such incredible people last night in broward county florida will never forget them or the evening our entire nation w/one heavy heart continues to pray for the victims  their families in parkland fl to teachers law enforcement first responders  medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger we thank you for your courage   russia started their anti-us campaign in 2014 long before i announced that i would run for president the results of the election were not impacted the trump campaign did nothing wrong no collusion cannot believe how badly daca recipients have been treated by the democratstotally abandoned republicans are still working hard i will be leaving for florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth but people whose lives have been totally shattered am also working with congress on many fronts presidential proclamation honoring the victims of the tragedy in parkland florida   lottery continues deadly catch-and-release and bars enforcement even for future illegal immigrants voting for this amendment would be a vote against law enforcement and a vote for open borders if dems are actually serious about daca they should support the grassley bill the schumer-rounds-collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe  says it would be the end of immigration enforcement in america it creates a giant amnesty including for dangerous criminals doesn't build the wall expands chain migration keeps the visa in times of tragedy the bonds that sustain us are those of family faith community and country these bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need   while the republicans and democrats in congress are working hard to come up with a solution to daca they should be strongly considering a system of merit based immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the usa so many signs that the florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem must always report such instances to authorities again and again just spoke to governor rick scott we are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible florida school shooting my prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible florida shooting no child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an american school today i was honored to be joined by republicans and democrats from both the house and senate as well as members of my cabinet to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore america's depleted infrastructure   as we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of african-americans to our nation our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all proclamation   negotiations on daca have begun republicans want to make a deal and democrats say they want to make a deal wouldn't it be great if we could finally after so many years solve the daca puzzle this will be our last chance there will never be another opportunity march 5th our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except of course the democrats after many years we have taken care of our military now we have to fix our roads bridges tunnels airports and more bipartisan make deal dems the journey to  began  2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something i look forward to every year see you at  thank you to sue kruczek who lost her wonderful and talented son nick to the opioid scourge for your kind words while on  we are fighting this terrible epidemic hard nick will not have died in vain this will be a big week for infrastructure after so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the middle east it is now time to start investing in our country just spoke to  to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from  this is a true tragedy rep lou barletta a great republican from pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters will make a fantastic senator he is strong  smart loves pennsylvania  loves our country voted for tax cuts unlike bob casey who listened to tax hikers pelosi and schumer 42 million hard working americans have already received a large bonus and/or pay increase because of our recently passed tax cut  jobs billand it will only get better we are far ahead of schedule so many positive things going on for the usa and the fake news media just doesn't want to go there same negative stories over and over again no wonder the people no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history     my administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe modern and lawful immigration system fully securing the border ending chain migration and canceling the visa lottery congress must secure the immigration system and protect americans  my thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers their families and everybody at the   republicans want to fix daca far more than the democrats do the dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011 and they decided not to do anything about daca they only want to use it as a campaign issue vote republican agencies not just the fbi  doj now the state department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the election comey had conversations with donald trump which i don't believe were accuratehe leaked information corrupt tom fitton of judicial watch on  my view is that not only has trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the dossier and the lies about the clinton/dnc dossier it shows that he's been victimized he's been victimized by the obama administration who were using all sorts of peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation some are true and some are false some are old and some are new there is no recovery for someone falsely accused life and career are gone is there no such thing any longer as due process according to the  a russian sold phony secrets on trump to the us asking price was $10 million brought down to $1 million to be paid over time i hope people are now seeing  understanding what is going on here it is all now starting to come out drain the swamp the democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods and more would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the white house for lack of transparency told them to re-do and send back in proper form jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more republicans in the 2018 election and beyond this bill is a big victory for our military but much waste in order to get dem votes fortunately daca not included in this bill negotiations to start now without more republicans in congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our military sadly we needed some dem votes for passage must elect more republicans in 2018 election just signed bill our military will now be stronger than ever before we love and need our military and gave them

reforms we need from congress to defeat it watch here   we need a 21st century merit-based immigration system  chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security  polling shows nearly 7 in 10 americans support an immigration reform package that includes daca fully secures the border ends chain migration  cancels the visa lottery if d's oppose this deal they aren't serious about daca-they just want open borders  my prayers and best wishes are with the family of edwin jackson a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken  so disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed  linebacker edwin jackson this is just one of many such preventable tragedies we must get the dems to get tough on the border and with illegal

nunes a man of tremendous courage and grit may someday be recognized as a great american hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure any deal on daca that does not include strong border security and the desperately needed wall is a total waste of time march 5th is rapidly approaching and the dems seem not to care about daca make a deal little adam schiff who is desperate to run for

about how the fbi and fisa appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermaththe fbi failed to inform the fisa court that the clinton campaign had funded the dossierthe fbi became great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages- and nobody even talks about them only russia russia russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is no collusion this memo totally vindicates trump in probe but the russian witch hunt goes on and on their was no collusion and there was no obstruction the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding nothing collusion is dead this is an american disgrace rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49percent a far better number than i had in winning the election and higher

blakeman on  for grading year one of my presidency with an a-and likewise to doug schoen for the very good grade and statements working hard great to see how hard republicans are fighting for our military and safety at the border the dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked if stalemate continues republicans should go to 51percent nuclear option and vote on real long term budget no cr's eric trump on  on  now the trump administration has terminated more unnecessary regulation in just twelve months than any other administration has terminated during their full term in office no matter what the length the good news is there is much more to come unprecedented success for our country in so many ways since the election record stock market strong on military crime

unemployment in 18 years democrats are holding our military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration can't let that happen  first for those asking the republicans only have 51 votes in the senate and they need 60 that is why we need to win more republicans in 2018 election we can then be even tougher on  crime and border and even better to our military  veterans this is the one year anniversary of my presidency and the democrats wanted to give me a nice present  democrats are far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border they could have easily made a deal but decided to play shutdown politics instead  in order to power through mess not looking good for our great military or safety  security on the very dangerous southern border dems want a shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the tax cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy excellent preliminary meeting in oval with  working on solutions for security and our great military together with  mcconnell and  making progress four week extension would be best just signed 702 bill to reauthorize

where it was my great honor to stand with our incredible workers and to show the world that america is back and we are coming back bigger and better and stronger than ever before  a government shutdown will be devastating to our militarysomething the dems care very little about chip should be part of a long term solution not a 30 day or short term extension we need the wall for the safety and security of our country we need the wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world if there is no wall there is no deal will be going to pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to rick saccone running for congress in a special election march 13 rick is a great guy we need more republicans to continue our already successful agenda the wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by mexico which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the us the $20 billion dollar wall is peanuts compared to what mexico makes from the us nafta is a bad joke the wall is the wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day i conceived of it parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water isis is in retreat our economy is booming investments and jobs are pouring back into the country and so much more together there is nothing we can't overcome--even a very biased media we are making america great again despite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage there are many great reporters i respect and lots of good news for the american people to be proud of and the fake news winners are main street is back strongest holiday sales bump since the great recession -- beating forecasts by billions of dollars  during the campaign i promised to make america great again by bringing businesses and jobs back to our country i am very proud to see companies like chrysler moving operations from mexico to michigan where there are so many great american workers  i promised that my policies would allow companies like apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the united states great to see apple follow through as a result of tax cuts huge win for american workers and the usa  today we witnessed an incredible moment in history  the presentation of congress' highest civilian honor to our friend and true american hero bob dole   eric trump on   now we need to keep america safe including moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system to one that is merit-based  new report from doj  dhs shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals convicted of terrorism-related charges are foreign-born we have submitted to congress a list of resources and reforms today it was my honor to welcome president nursultan nazarbayev of kazakhstan to the   president donald j trump proclaims january 16 2018 as religious freedom day  unemployment for black americans is the lowest ever recorded trump approval ratings with black americans has doubled thank you and it will get even much better  90percent of trump 2017 news coverage was negative -and much of it contrived do you notice the fake news mainstream media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative the russian collusion hoax is dead except as it pertains to the dems public gets it the democrats want to shut down the government over amnesty for all and border security the biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding military at a time we need it more than ever we need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now no more dangerous lottery we must have security at our very dangerous southern border and we must have a great wall to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country senator dicky durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the daca meeting deals can't get made when there is no trust durbin blew daca and is hurting our military to stop drugs they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do my standard is very simple america first  make america great again statement by me last night in florida honestly i don't think the democrats want to make a deal they talk about daca but they don't want to helpwe are ready willing and able to make a deal but they don't want to they don't want security at the border they don't want big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible among many other things president trump reversed the policies of president obama and reversed our economic decline thank you stuart varney   president trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy tax cut bonuses to more than 2000000 workers most explosive stock market rally that we've seen in modern times 18000 to 26000 from election and grounded in profitability and growth all trump not 0 i as president want people coming into our country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on merit no more lotteries  first daca is probably dead because the democrats don't really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our military and they knew exactly what i said and meant they just wanted a story fake news the wall street journal stated falsely that i said to them i have a good relationship with kim jong un of n korea obviously i didn't say that i said i'd have a good relationship with kim jong un a big difference fortunately we now record conversations with reporters so much fake news is being reported they don't even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong they promote the fake book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information the mainstream media is crazed that we won the election i don't believe the democrats really want to see a deal on daca they are all talk and no action this is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have too bad america first the democrats are all talk and no action they are doing nothing to fix daca great opportunity missed too bad yesterday was a big day for the stock market jobs are coming back to america chrysler is coming back to the usa from mexico and many others will follow tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing american business is hot again yesterday was another big day for jobs and the stock market chrysler coming back to us michigan from mexico and many more companies paying out tax cut money to employees if dems won in november market would have tanked it was headed for disaster today it was my great honor to proclaim january 15 2018 as martin luther king jr federal holiday i encourage all americans to observe this day with appropriate civic community and service activities in honor of dr king's life and legacy  never said anything derogatory about haitians other than haiti is obviously a very poor and troubled country never said take them out made up by dems i have a wonderful relationship with haitians probably should record future meetings unfortunately no trust sadly democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for daca take care of our military and our country first the language used by me at the daca meeting was tough but this was not the language used what was really tough was the outlandish proposal made a big setback for daca because of the democrats not being interested in life and safety daca has now taken a big step backwards the dems will threaten shutdown but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most get smart make america great again countries which are doing badly i want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level i want safety and security for our people i want to stop the massive inflow of drugs i want to fund our military not do a dem defund the so-called bipartisan daca deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of republican senators and congressmen was a big step backwards wall was not properly funded chain  lottery were made worse and usa would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime reason i canceled my trip to london is that i am not a big fan of the obama administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in london for peanuts only to build a new one in an off location for 12 billion dollars bad deal wanted me to cut ribbon-no the democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the southern border risking thousands of lives in the process it is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all americans we must build a great wall think merit and end lottery  chain usa democrat dianne feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal she blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold a first chrysler is moving a massive plant from mexico to michigan reversing a years long opposite trend thank you chrysler a very wise decision the voters in michigan are very happy they voted for trump/pence plenty of more to follow more great news as a result of historical tax cuts and reform fiat chrysler announces plan to invest more than $1 billion in michigan plant relocating their heavy-truck production from mexico to michigan adding 2500 new jobs and paying $2000 bonus to us employees  small business poll has highest approval numbers in the polls history all business is just at the beginning of something really special thank you adam levine the federalist in interview on   donald trump is the greatest president our country has ever seen yesterday i signed the  hr 2142 with bipartisan members of congress to help end the flow of drugs into our country together we are committed to doing everything we can to combat the deadly scourge of drug addiction and overdose in the united states  great news as a result of our tax cuts  jobs act  with that being said i have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office

doubling down on barack obama's failed policies washes away any doubts that america made the right choice this was truly a change election  and the changes trump is bringing are far-reaching  necessary thank you michael goodwin  his is turning out to be an enormously consequential presidency so much so that despite my own frustration over his missteps there has never been a day when i wished hillary clinton were president not one indeed as trump's accomplishments accumulate the mere thought of the stock market has been creating tremendous benefits for our country in the form of not only record setting stock prices but present and future jobs jobs jobs seven trillion dollars of value created since our big election win the fake news awards those going to the most corrupt  biased

the fake news from the first day i announced that i would be running for president now i have to put up with a fake book written by a totally discredited author ronald reagan had the same problem and handled it well so will i leaving camp david for the white house great meetings with the cabinet and military on many very important subjects including border security  the desperately needed wall the ever increasing drug and opioid problem infrastructure military budget trade and daca to president of the united states on my first try i think that would qualify as not smart but geniusand a very stable genius at that actually throughout my life my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being like really smart crooked hillary clinton also played these cards very hard and as everyone knows went down in flames i went from very successful businessman to top tv star now that russian collusion after one year of intense study has proven to be a total hoax on the american public the democrats and their lapdogs the fake news mainstream media are taking out the old ronald reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence brian ross the reporter who made a fraudulent live newscast about me that drove the stock market down 350 points billions of dollars was suspended for a month but is now back at abc news in a lower capacity he is no longer allowed to report on trump should have been fired the african american unemployment rate fell to 68percent the lowest rate in 45 years i am so happy about this news and in the washington post of all places headline states trumps first year jobs numbers were very very good michael wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book he used sloppy steve bannon who cried when he got fired and begged for his job now sloppy steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone too bad  good idea rand  the mercer family recently dumped the leaker known as sloppy steve bannon smart well now that collusion with russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with hillary clinton and the fbi/russia the fake news media mainstream and this

really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between north and south korea right now if i wasn't firm strong and willing to commit our total might against the north fools but talks are a good thing as americans you need identification sometimes in a very strong and accurate form for almost everything you doexcept when it comes to the most important thing voting for the people that run

dollars to for nothing but also many other countries and others as an example we pay the palestinians hundred of millions of dollars a year and get no appreciation or respect they don't even want to

their pockets the people have little food big inflation and no human rights the us is watching will be leaving florida for washington dc today at 4:00 pm much work to be done but it will be a great new year iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the obama administration the great iranian people have been repressed for many years they are hungry for food  for freedom along with human rights the wealth of iran is being looted time for change the united states has foolishly given pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years and they have given us nothing but lies  deceit thinking of our leaders as fools they give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in afghanistan with little help no more happy new year we are making america great again and much faster than anyone thought possible as our country rapidly grows stronger and smarter i want to wish all of my friends supporters enemies haters and even the very dishonest fake news media a happy and healthy new year 2018 will be a great year for america iran the number one state of sponsored terror with numerous violations of human rights occurring on an hourly basis has

for human rights violations trump rally stocks put 2017 in the record books  jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the us unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically cut and it will only get better much more to come i use social media not because i like to but because it is the only way to fight a very dishonest and unfair press now often referred to as fake news media phony and non-existent sources are being used more often than ever many stories  reports a pure fiction on taxes this is the biggest corporate rate cut ever going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years agothis is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy every year the obama wh overstated how the economy would grow now real economics and jobs  report oppressive regimes cannot endure forever and the day will come when the iranian people will face a choice the world is watching  the entire world understands that the good people of iran want change and other than the vast military power of the united states that iran's people are what their leaders fear the most  many reports of peaceful protests by iranian citizens fed up with regime's corruption  its squandering of the nation's wealth to fund terrorism abroad iranian govt should respect their people's rights including right to express themselves the world is watching  the democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no daca without the desperately needed wall at the southern border and an end to the horrible chain migration  ridiculous lottery system of immigration etc we must protect our country at all cost why is the united states post office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer should be charging much more while the fake news loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating  just showed that my rating on dec 28 2017 was approximately the same as president obama on dec 28 2009 which was 47percentand this despite massive negative trump coverage  russia hoax in the east it could be the coldest new year's eve on record perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old global warming that our country but not other countries was going to pay trillions of dollars to protect against bundle up together we are making america great

the nfl and its players for disrespect of our country🇺🇸 general john kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on nfl players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our flag or great country  is  just reported cos john kelly was opposed to my stance on nfl players disrespecting flag anthem country total lie  the white house never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night important meetings taking place today big tax cuts  reform the issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race it is about respect for our country flag and national anthem nfl must respect this many people booed

remarks:  the  sometimes referred to as the guardian of amazon not paying internet taxes which they should is fake news some of the fake news media likes to say that i am not totally engaged in healthcare wrong i know the subject well  want victory for us the failing  writes false story after false story about me they don't even call to verify the facts of a story a fake news joke i just finished a great meeting with the republican senators concerning healthcare they really want to get it right unlike ocare with zero democrats to help and a failed expensive and dangerous obamacare as the dems legacy the republican senators are working hard so they caught fake news cnn cold but what about nbc cbs  abc what about the failing    they are all fake news fake news cnn is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony russian stories ratings way down wow cnn had to retract big story on russia with 3 employees forced to resign what about all the other phony stories they do fake news great day for america's future security and safety courtesy of the us supreme court i will keep fighting for the american people  win from  bombshell in 2016 obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an american election  check out his statement witch hunt very grateful for the 9-o decision from the u s supreme court we must keep america safe republican senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the democrats not easy perhaps just let ocare crash  burn under a magnifying glass they have zero tapes of t people colluding there is no collusion  no obstruction i should be given apology the real story is that president obama did nothing after being informed in august about russian meddling with 4 months looking at russia and did not want to rock the boat he didn't choke he colluded or obstructed and it did the dems and crooked hillary no good the reason that president obama did nothing about russia after being notified by the cia of meddling is that he expected clinton would win the democrats have become nothing but obstructionists they have no policies or ideas all they do is delay and complainthey own obamacare i am on  enjoy hillary clinton colluded with the democratic party in order to beat crazy bernie sanders is she allowed to so collude unfair to bernie make america great again i cannot imagine that these very fine republican senators would allow the american people to suffer a broken obamacare any longer obama administration official said they choked when it came to acting on russian meddling of election they didn't want to hurt hillary since the obama administration was told way before the 2016 election that the russians were meddling why no action focus on them not t democrats slam gop healthcare proposal as obamacare premiums  deductibles increase by over 100percent remember keep your doctor keep your plan just out the obama administration knew far in advance of november 8th about election meddling by russia did nothing about it why weekly address🇺🇸  today it was a tremendous honor for me to sign the  act into law delivering my campaign promise  i've helped pass and signed 38 legislative bills mostly with no democratic support and gotten rid of massive amounts of regulations nice will be on  enjoy   i were honored to host our first wh congressional picnic a wonderful evening  tradition   we're all thinking of you    together we are going to make america great again🇺🇸  i am very supportive of the senate  look forward to making it really special remember obamacare is dead mexico was just ranked the second deadliest country in the world after only syria drug trade is largely the cause we will build the wall whether there are tapes or recordings of my conversations with james comey but i did not make and do not have any such recordings with all of the recently reported electronic surveillance intercepts unmasking and illegal leaking of information i have no idea i certainly hope the democrats do not force nancy p out that would be very bad for the republican party and please let cryin' chuck stay why did the dnc refuse to turn over its server to the fbi and still hasn't it's all a big dem scam and excuse for losing the election why did democratic national committee turn down the dhs offer to protect against hacks long prior to election it's all a big dem hoax by the way if russia was working so hard on the 2016 election it all took place during the obama admin why didn't they stop them former homeland security advisor jeh johnson is

fake news  outgoing cia chief john brennan blasts pres-elect trump on russia threat does not fully understand oh really couldn't do  is bad but saturday night live is the worst of nbc not funny cast

january 20th washington dc have fun congressman john lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the us i can use all the help i can get intelligence insiders now claim the trump dossier is a complete fraud   mention crime infested rather than falsely complaining about the election results all talk talk talk no action or results sad congressman john lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district which is in horrible shape and falling apart not to a beautiful funeral today for a real nyc hero detective steven mcdonald our law enforcement community has my complete and total support the unaffordable care act will soon be history have been allowed to run guilty as hell they were very nice to her she lost because she campaigned in the wrong states no enthusiasm what are hillary clinton's people complaining about with respect to the fbi based on the information they had she should never released by intelligence even knowing there is no proof and never will be my people will have a full report on hacking within 90 days totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives both democrats and republicans fake news russia says nothing exists probably it now turns out that the phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued all of my cabinet nominee are looking good and doing a great job i want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts not mine congrats to the senate for taking the first step to  now it's onto the house  is in a total meltdown with their fake news because their ratings are tanking since election and their credibility will soon be gone thank you to linda bean of llbean for your great support and courage people will support you even more now buy llbean  james clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated made up phony factstoo bad we had a great news conference at trump tower today a couple of fake news organizations were there but the people truly get what's going on intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to leak into the public one last shot at meare we living in nazi germany i win an election easily a great movement is verified and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with fake news a sorry state russia has never tried to use leverage over me i have nothing to do with russia no deals no loans no nothing russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is a complete and total fabrication utter nonsense very unfair buzzfeed runs unverifiable trump-russia claims'   fake news a total political witch hunt trump helps lift small business confidence to 12-yr high'  small business optimism soars after trump election'  us small-business optimism index surges by most since 1980' thank you to all of the men and women who protect  serve our communities 24/7/365   an old picture with nancy and ronald reagan  ford said last week that it will expand in michigan and us instead of building a billion dollar plant in mexico thank you ford  fiat c it's finally happening fiat chrysler just announced plans to invest $1billion in michigan and ohio plants adding 2000 jobs this after groveling when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad just more very dishonest media hillary flunky who lost big for the 100th time i never mocked a disabled reporter would never do that but simply showed him meryl streep one of the most over-rated actresses in hollywood doesn't know me but attacked last night at the golden globes she is a rupert murdoch is a great guy who likes me much better as a very successful candidate than he ever did as a very successful developer dishonest media says mexico won't be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly media is fake before i or anyone saw the classified and/or highly confidential hacking intelligence report it was leaked out to  so serious kellyanne conway went to  this morning for an interview with  dishonest media cut out 9 of her 10 minutes terrible i look very much forward to meeting prime minister theresa may in washington in the spring britain a longtime us ally is very special congratulation to jane timken on her major upset victory in becoming the ohio republican party chair jane is a loyal trump supporter  star both countries will perhaps work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the world have enough problems around the world without yet another one when i am president russia will respect us far more than they do now and having a good relationship with russia is a good thing not a bad thing only stupid people or fools would think that it is bad we only reason the hacking of the poorly defended dnc is discussed is that the loss by the dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results voting machines not touched gross negligence by the democratic national committee allowed hacking to take placethe republican national committee had strong defense happy birthday  monitoring the terrible situation in florida just spoke to governor scott thoughts and prayers for all stay safe i am asking the chairs of the house and senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with nbc prior to me seeing it anna wintour came to my office at trump tower to ask me to meet with the editors of conde nast  steven newhouse a friend will go this am being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14 now compare him to my season 1 but who cares he supported kasich  hillary wow the ratings are in and arnold schwarzenegger got swamped or destroyed by comparison to the ratings machine djt so much for hopefully all supporters and those who want to make america great again will go to dc on january 20th it will be a great show and knew they were in big trouble which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minutethey saw a movement like never before hillary and the dems were never going to beat the passion of my voters they saw what was happening in the last two weeks before the the dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the great wall for sake of speed will be paid back by mexico later so how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers what is going on the democratic national committee would not allow the fbi to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by russia how did nbc get an exclusive look into the top secret report he obama was presented who gave them this report and why politics toyota motor said will build a new plant in baja mexico to build corolla cars for us no way build plant in us or pay big border tax to make up their own minds as to the truth the media lies to make it look like i am against intelligence when in fact i am a big fan the dishonest media likes saying that i am in agreement with julian assange wrong i simply state what he states it is for the people time for republicans  democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works much less expensive  far better do the typical political thing and blame the fact is obamacare was a lie from the beginningkeep you doctor keep your plan it is the democrats lead by head clown chuck schumer know how bad obamacare is and what a mess they are in instead of working to fix it they jackie evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performancesome people just don't understand the movement massive increases of obamacare will take place this year and dems are to blame for the mess it will fall of its own weight be careful like the 116percent hike in arizona also deductibles are so high that it is practically useless don't let the schumer clowns out of this web republicans must be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases things they did and said like giving the questions to the debate to h a total double standard media as usual gave them a pass somebody hacked the dnc but why did they not have hacking defense like the rnc has and why have they not responded to the terrible thank you to ford for scrapping a new plant in mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the us this is just the beginning much more to follow julian assange said a 14 year old could have hacked podesta why was dnc so careless also said russians did not give him the info the intelligence briefing on so-called russian hacking was delayed until friday perhaps more time needed to build a case very strange i will be having a general news conference on january eleventh in nyc thank you trump is already delivering the jobs he promised america  there should be no further releases from gitmo these are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield instead of driving jobs and wealth away america will become the world's great magnet for innovation  job creation may be their number one act and priority focus on tax reform healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance  with all that congress has to work on do they really have to make the weakening of the independent ethics watchdog as unfair as it the democrat governorof minnesota said the affordable care act obamacare is no longer affordable and it is lousy healthcare people must remember that obamacare just doesn't work and it is not affordable 116percent increases arizona bill clinton called it crazy general motors is sending mexican made model of chevy cruze to us car dealers-tax free across border make in usaor pay big border tax china has been taking out massive amounts of money  wealth from the us in totally one-sided trade but won't help with north korea nice north korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the us it won't happen i thought and felt i would win big easily over the fabled 270 306 when they cancelled fireworks they knew and so did i various media outlets and pundits say that i thought i was going to lose the election wrong it all came together in the last week and chicago murder rate is record setting 4331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016 if mayor can't do it he must ask for federal help well the new year begins we will together make america great again to all americans-  many blessings to you all looking forward to a wonderful  prosperous 2017 as we  happy birthday  happy new year to all including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do love russians are playing  and  for such fools funny to watch they don't have a clue  totally gets it join  founded by hall of fame legend  on 1/19/2017 in washington dc  great move on delay by v putin i always knew he was very smart my administration will follow two simple rules  economists say trump delivered hope'  not anymore the beginning of the end was the horrible iran deal and now this un stay strong israel january 20th is fast approaching we cannot continue to let israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect they used to have a great friend in the us but doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory president o statements and roadblocksthought it was going to be a smooth transition not the us consumer confidence index for december surged nearly four points to 1137 the highest level in more than 15 years thanks donald president obama campaigned hard and personally in the very important swing states and lostthe voters wanted to make america great again the djt foundation unlike most foundations never paid fees rent salaries or any expenses 100percent of money goes to wonderful charities i gave millions of dollars to djt foundation raised or recieved millions more all of which is given to charity and media won't report the world was gloomy before i won there was no hope now the market is up nearly 10percent and christmas spending is over a trillion dollars the united nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together talk and have a good time so sad president obama said that he thinks he would have won against me he should say that but i say no way jobs leaving isis ocare etc merry christmas and a very very very  very happy new year to everyone    objectified tonight at 10:00 pm enjoy happy   the big loss yesterday for israel in the united nations will make it much harder to negotiate peacetoo bad but we will get it done anyway  purposely left out this part of my nuclear qoute until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes  dishonest vladimir putin said today about hillary and dems in my opinion it is humiliating one must be able to lose with dignity  so true slaughter you this is a purely religious threat which turned into reality such hatred when will the us and all countries fight back the terrorist who killed so many people in germany said just before crime by god's will we will slaughter you pigs i swear we will as to the un things will be different after jan 20th my presidency isn't this a ridiculous shame he loves these kids has raised millions of dollars for them and now must stop wrong answer my wonderful son eric will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with the so-called a list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration but look what they did for hillary nothing i want the people based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the lockheed martin f-35 i have asked boeing to price-out a comparable f-18 super hornet the united states must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes someone incorrectly stated that the phrase drain the swamp was no longer being used by me actually we will always be trying to dts the resolution being considered at the united nations security council regarding israel should be vetoedcont  i met some really great air force generals and navy admirals today talking about airplane capability and pricing very impressive people i have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that i spent far less money on the win than hillary on the loss i would have done even better in the election if that is possible if the winner was based on popular vote but would campaign differently campaigning to win the electoral college is much more difficult  sophisticated than the popular vote hillary focused on the wrong states yes it is true carlos slim the great businessman from mexico called me about getting together for a meeting we met he is a great guy especially how to get people even with an unlimited budget out to vote in the vital swing states  and more they focused on wrong states bill clinton stated that i called him after the election wrong he called me with a very nice congratulations he doesn't know much  we did it thank you to all of my great supporters we just officially won the election despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media today there were terror attacks in turkey switzerland and germany and it is only getting worse the civilized world must change thinking if my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing they would be scorned  called terrible names we should tell china that we don't want the

tennessee during these terrible wildfires stay safe nobody should be allowed to burn the american flag if they do there must be consequences perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail i thought that  would get better after they failed so badly in their support of hillary clinton however since election they are worse the great state of michigan was just certified as a trump win giving all of our make america great again supporters another victory 306  is so embarrassed by their total  100percent support of hillary clinton and yet her loss in a landslide that they don't know what to do just met with general petraeus--was very impressed if cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the cuban people the cuban/american people and the us as a whole i will terminate deal serious voter fraud in virginia new hampshire and california so why isn't the media reporting on this serious bias big problem states instead of the 15 states that i visited i would have won even more easily and convincingly but smaller states are forgotten it would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the electoral college in that i would only campaign in 3 or 4-- in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally trump is going to be our president we owe him an open mind and the chance to lead so much time and money will be spent same result sad this election that is a direct threat to our democracy she then said we have to accept the results and look to the future donald -- of position then separately she stated he said something truly horrifying  he refused to say that he would respect the results of -- during a general election i for one am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind -- and fair elections we've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a - hillary's debate answer on delay that is horrifying that is not the way our democracy works been around for 240 years we've had free -- hillary clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in nothing will change the democrats when they incorrectly thought they were going to win asked that the election night tabulation be accepted not so anymore the green party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated  demoralized dems fidel castro is dead i am working hard even on thanksgiving trying to get carrier ac company to stay in the us indiana making progress will know soon happy thanksgiving to everyone we will together make america great again let us give thanks for all that we have and let us boldly face the exciting new frontiers that lie ahead happy th  bus crash in tennessee so sad  so terrible condolences to all family members and loved ones these

that but why announce perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the  in the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone i cancelled today's meeting with the failing  when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment not nice many people would like to see  represent great britain as their ambassador to the united states he would do a great job prior to the election it was well known that i have interests in properties all over the worldonly the crooked media makes this a big deal  update and policy plans for the first 100 days  i have always had a good relationship with chuck schumer he is far smarter than harry r and has the ability to get things done good news general james mad dog mattis who is being considered for secretary of defense was very impressive yesterday a true general's general i watched parts of  saturday night live last night it is a totally one-sided biased show nothing funny at all equal time for us numerous patriots will be coming to bedminster today as i continue to fill out the various positions necessary to make america great again the cast and producers of hamilton which i hear is highly overrated

apologize our wonderful future vp mike pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of hamilton cameras blazingthis should not happen the only bad thing about winning the presidency is that i did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on trump u too bad i settled the trump university lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as president i have to focus on our country will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to make america great again i worked hard with bill ford to keep the lincoln plant in kentucky i owed it to the great state of kentucky for their confidence in me just got a call from my friend bill ford chairman of ford who advised me that he will be keeping the lincoln plant in kentucky no

news if they continue to be the press shop for hillary clinton join governor mike pence in reno nevada- tonight at 7pm tickets available at    so with all of the obama tough talk on russia and the ukraine they have already taken crimea and continue to push that's what i said when i said in an interview that putin is not going into ukraine you can mark it down i am saying if i am president already in crimea this story is not about mr khan who is all over the place doing interviews but rather radical islamic terrorism and the us get smart mr khan who does not know me viciously attacked me from the stage of the dnc and is now all over tv doing the same nice wow it is unbelievable how distorted one-sided and biased the media is against us the failing  is a joke  is laughable the dishonest media is fawning over the democratic convention i wonder why then my speech had millions of more viewers than crooked h i was viciously attacked by mr khan at the democratic convention am i not allowed to respond hillary voted for the iraq war not me captain khan killed 12 years ago was a hero but this is about radical islamic terror and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it we crushed the original goal i will write a $2 million check to our campaign if we hit our end-of-month goal   nielson media research final numbers on acceptance speech trump  322 million  clinton 278 million  thank you thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the republican national convention  over crooked hillary and dems can you imagine if i had the small crowds that hillary is drawing today in pennsylvania it would be a major media event   nato commander agrees members should pay up via  wow nato's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must pay their bills this is a general i will like the rust belt was created by politicians like the clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like mexico end crooked's stop in johnstown pennsylvania where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians drew less than 200 with bill vp  = obama's third term which would be terrible news for our economic growth seen below  word is that crooked hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in pennsylvania perhaps it is because her husband signed nafta i turned down a meeting with charles and david koch much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics they will do much better why doesn't the media want to report that on the two big thursdays when crooked hillary and i made our speeches republican's won ratings   crooked hillary clinton is soft on crime supports open borders and wants massive tax hikes a formula for disaster violent crime is rising across the united states yet the dnc convention ignored it crime reduction will be one of my top priorities i will write a $2 million check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal  just got back from

really thinks of crooked hillary clinton  i am watching crooked hillary speak same old stuff our country needs change wow my campaign is hearing from more and more bernie supporters that they will never support crooked hillary she sold them out vp pick in hillary clinton's america things get worse   the dishonest media didn't mention that bernie sanders was very angry looking during crooked's speech he wishes he didn't make that deal thank you facebook    crooked hillary said that i couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign reallyi just beat 16 people and am beating her if michael bloomberg ran again for mayor of new york he wouldn't get 10percent of the vote they would run him out of town   little michael bloomberg who never had the guts to run for president knows nothing about me his last term as mayor was a disaster general john allen who i never met but spoke against me last night failed badly in his fight against isis his record = bad   crooked hillary clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech many of her statements were lies and fabrications join  at the university of northwestern ohio- tonight at 7pm tickets  campaign statement  two policemen just shot in san diego one dead it is only getting worse people want law and order crooked hillary clinton made up facts about me and forgot to mention the many problems of our country in her very average scream the media coverage this morning of the very average clinton speech and convention is a joke  and the little watched  = sad no one has worse judgement than hillary clinton corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes hillary's wars in the middle east have unleashed destruction terrorism and isis across the world hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power no jobs no safety hillary will never reform wall street she is owned by wall street our way of life is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words hillary's refusal to mention radical islam as she pushes a 550percent increase in refugees is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country i will once again write a $1 million check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal  departing now thank you cedar rapids iowa this is a movement  i will once again write a $1 million check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal    as president i will fix this rigged system and only answer to you the american people  //tco/hjyzqvwmac dems warn not to

illegal families crossing border set to double 51152 so far great new poll thank you  if russia or any other country or person has hillary clinton's 33000 illegally deleted emails perhaps they should share them with the fbi join our next vice president  in wisconsin tonight  michigan thursdaymi   not one american flag on the massive stage at the democratic national convention until people started complaining-then a small one pathetic our not very bright vice president joe biden just stated that i wanted to carpet bomb the enemy sorry joe that was ted cruz crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about the danger is massive no hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally get tough the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country no recognition sad funny how the failing  is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said trump is a genius america 1st as i have been saying crooked hillary will approve the job killing tpp after the election despite her statements to the contrary top adv just like i have warned from the beginning crooked hillary clinton will betray you on the tpp  many of bernie's supporters have left the arena did bernie go home and go to sleep i hate to say it but the republican convention was far more interesting with a much more beautiful set than the democratic convention no matter what bill clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible highly overrated you have no idea what my strategy on isis is and neither does isis a good thing please get your facts straight thanks  i'm with you i will work hard and never let you down make america great again  i'm with you i will work hard and never let you down make america great again  i'm with you i will work hard and never let you down make america great again  for the record i have zero investments in russia in order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the wikileakes disaster the dems said maybe it is russia dealing with trump crazy dems don't want to talk isis b/c hillary's foreign interventions unleashed isis  her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here bernie's exhausted he just wants to shut down and go home to bed the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar thank you new hampshire   join us in toledo ohio- tomorrow night at 8pm     join us tomorrow in scranton pennsylvania at 3pm  tickets   pocahontas bombed last night sad to watch why aren't the democrats speaking about isis bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order the republican convention was great funny if you listen to  the democrats did not have a good day if you listen to the other two they are fawning what a difference bernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton all of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it waste of time elizabeth warren often referred to as pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary who she always hated sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs if cory booker is the future of the democratic party they have no future i know more about cory than he knows about himself i was at  and met juan williams in passing  he asked if he could have pictures taken with me i said fine he then trashes on air hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold he got nothing for all of the time energy and money the vp a joke while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers clinton betrayed bernie voters kaine supports tpp is in pocket of wall street and backed iraq war thank you ohio   thank you roanoke virginia- be back soon   make america safe and great again      great poll numbers are coming out all over people don't want another four years of obama and crooked hillary would be even worse  the state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz that they will vote for change wow the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess but fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn here we go again with another clinton scandal and e-mails yet can you believe crooked hillary knew the fix was in b never had a chance crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the dnc they just got caught that's all they laughed at bernie if bernie sanders after seeing the just released e-mails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same thank you   hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb e-mails using even religion against bernie the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc e-mails which should never have been written stupid because putin likes me watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on 60 minutes no way they are going to fix america's problems isis  all others laughing the ratings for the republican national convention were very good but for the final night my speech great thank you the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory she's out the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing e-mails say the rigged system is alive  well even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength i don't believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top dws too bad bernie flamed out if the republican convention had blown up with e-mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player bernie media would go wild the  panels are so one sided almost all against trump  is so much better and the ratings are much higher don't watch cnn i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted no energy left today proves what i have always known that  priebus is the tough one and the smart one not debbie wasserman shultz  sorry folks but bernie sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer he is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and dnc disrespect sad there is no longer a bernie sanders political revolution he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates looks like the bernie people will fight if not their blood sweat and tears was a total waste of time kaine stands for opposite wow president obama's brother malik just announced that he is voting for me was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else bernie sanders started off strong but with the selection of kaine for vp is ending really weak so much for a movement total disrespect the crooked hillary vp choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters just another case of bad judgement by h   thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night from the heart the wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together isis and our other enemies are drooling they don't look presidential to me i will bring jobs back and get wages up people haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years clinton killed jobs tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved job killer funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs i will bring jobs back crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania against steelworkers and miners husband signed nafta leaked e-mails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders mock his heritage and much more on-line from wikileakes really vicious rigged pocahontas wanted vp slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the senate also crooked hillary hates her tim kaine is and always has been owned by the banks bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice bernie fought for nothing the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for philly fight i highly recommend the just out book the field of fight by general michael flynn how to defeat radical islam is it the same kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while governor of virginia and didn't get indicted while bob m did another attack this time in germany many killed god bless the people of munich one of the best produced including the incredible stage  set

people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened that is before she found out the episode was on tape wow corey lewandowski my campaign manager and a very decent man was just charged with assaulting a reporter look at tapes-nothing there how come the    show the new  poll for hillary vs bernie but do not show the same poll where i am killing cruz i have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than cruz or kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the republican party or the rnc wow  has nothing but my opponents on their shows really one-sided and unfair reporting maybe i shouldn't do their town-hall tonight we need to secure our borders asap no games we must be smart tough and vigilant make america great again  make america strong again lyin' ted i have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates you should focus on jobs  illegal imm lyin'ted cruz is weak  losing big so now he wants to debate again but according to drudgetime and on-line polls i have won all debates after the way i beat gov scott walker and jeb rand marco and all others in the presidential primaries no way he would ever endorse me just released that international gangs are all over our cities this will end when i am president ted cruz is incensed that i want to refocus nato on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to pay fair share a must a detainee released from gitmo has killed an american when will our so-called leaders ever learn kirsten powers anti- trump operative was aggressively shopping cruz story via the gateway pundit  i will be interviewed on  at 7:30 things are looking good had a great easter-look forward to spending the week in wisconsin the united states cannot continue to make such bad one-sided trade deals there are only so many jobs we can give up no more see lyin' ted even the  no fan of mine says this story came from rubio not trump  just to show you how unfair republican primary politics can be i won the state of louisiana and get less delegates than cruz-lawsuit coming why can't the pundits be honest hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again i will make it strong and great  jobs another radical islamic attack this time in pakistan targeting christian women  children at least 67 dead400 injured i alone can solve happy easter to all have a great day my statement on nato being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive and unfair for the us are now finally receiving plaudits wow sleepy eyes  is at it again he is do totally biased the things i am saying are correct far better vision than the others i am interviewed on this week on  this morning enjoy remember i am the only candidate who is self-funding while i am given little credit for this by the voters i am not bought like others don't believe the  polls they are just another phony hit job on me i will beat hillary clinton easily in the general election wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in us jobs are leaving i will make our economy strong again bring in jobs nobody will protect our nation like donald j trump our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong illegals out lyin' ted cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with the national enqwere caused by me i had nothing to do with story the press is going out of their way to convince people that i do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite the media is so after me on women  wow this is a tough business nobody has more respect for women than donald trump top suspect in paris massacre salah abdeslam who also knew of the brussels attack is no longer talking weak leaders ridiculous laws wow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me how am i still number one by a lot i didn't start the fight with lyin'ted cruz over the gq cover pic of melania he did he knew the pac was putting it out hence lyin' ted just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the trump u case but the press refuses to write about it if i lost-monster story make america great again  endorsements for lyin' ted cruz-  europe and the us must immediately stop taking in people from syria this will be the destruction of civilization as we know it so sad just announced that as many as 5000 isis fighters have infiltrated europe also many in us  i told you so i alone can fix this problem explain how the women on the view which is a total disaster since the great barbara walters left ever got their jobs  is wasting time  tv show which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on i tell them no hillary clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years time for a change i will solve and fast it is amazing how often i am right only to be criticized by the media illegal immigration take the oil build the wall muslims nato remember when i recently said that brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing  wrote a critical article i was so right these politicians like cruz and graham who have watched isis and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better  and lyin' ted cruz are two politicians who are very much alike all talk and no action both talk about isis do nothing it is amazing how  gets on so many tv shows talking negatively about me when i beat him so badly zero in his pres run we pay a disproportionate share of the cost of nato why it is time to renegotiate and the time is now nato is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on make america great again i want to thank  for all of his help in our historic arizona win could not have done it without you joe while i believe i will clinch before cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race i think having jeb's endorsement hurts lyin' ted jeb spent more than $150000000 and got nothing i spent a fraction of that and am first i will be the best by far in fighting terror i'm the only one that was right from the beginning  now lyin' ted  others are copying me just watched hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror she's been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are low energy jeb bush just endorsed a man he truly hates lyin' ted cruz honestly i can't blame jeb in that i drove him into oblivion lyin' ted cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from michael douglas just another dishonest politician thank you arizona    lyin' ted cruz denied that he had anything to do with the gq model photo post of melania that's why we call him lyin' ted hopefully the republican party can come together and have a big win in november paving the way for many great supreme court justices much bigger win than anticipated in arizona thank you i will never forget thank you arizona    incompetent hillary despite the horrible attack in brussels today wants borders to be weak and open-and let the muslims flow in  no way lyin' ted cruz just used a picture of melania from a gq shoot in his ad be careful lyin' ted or i will spill the beans on your wife pres obama should leave the baseball game in cuba immediately  get home to washington- where a  under a serious emergency belongs obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger shame  message from     message from      video       my heart  prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible  tragedy this madness must be stopped and i will stop it watch this clip from earlier this year time  time again i have been right about terrorism it's time to get tough  i have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it's not even close hopefully az and ut will be voting for me today make america great again president obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in cuba especially in the shadows of brussels he is being treated badly do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place brussels was not anymore it is from a different world us must be vigilant and smart wow president obama just landed in cuba a big deal and raul castro wasn't even there to greet him he greeted pope and others no respect big republican dinner tonight at mar-a-lago in palm beach i will be there so the highly overrated anchor  is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but i can't fight back wrong the protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my rally in arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters why is it that the horrendous protesters who scream curse punch

take on paul ryan just leaving salt lake city utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions love utah- will be back why haven't they released the final missouri victory for us yet could it be because cruz's guy runs missouri i guess i have reached yet another ceiling  497percent with four people my highest reuters poll yet thank you  do you believe that hillary clinton now wants obamacare for illegal immigrants she should spend more time taking care of our great vets everybody should boycott the  show never worth watching always a hit on trump she is sick  the most overrated person on tv thank you arizona- i love you    join me tomorrow   mitt romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue no wonder he lost failed presidential candidate mitt romney was campaigning with john kasich  marco rubio and now he is endorsing ted cruz 1/2 failed presidential candidate mitt romney the man who choked and let us all down is now endorsing lyin' ted cruz this is good for me going to salt lake city utah for a big rally lyin' ted cruz should not be allowed to win there mormons don't like liars i beat hillary club for growth letter- trying to extort $100000000 from me remember i said- no  club for growth tried to extort $1000000 from me when i said no they went hostile with negative ads disgraceful with millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up can anyone explain this  got fired like a dog from redstateand now he is the one leading opposition against me senator  made horrible statements about   and then he endorsed

me know  highly overrated  crazy  is always complaining about trump and yet she devotes her shows to me focus on others megyn looking like my 5 victories on tuesday will be just as good as if i won ohio two more days and ohio was mine see you in arizona on friday and saturday  please explain to the dummies at the   editorial board that i love to debate and have won according to drudge etc all 11 of them  is bad at math the good news is nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore especially me  editorial says clinton primary vote total is 8646551trump's is 7533692-a knock but she had only 3 opponents-i had 16apologize the reason lyin' ted cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem crazy  is now complaining that   did not defend her against me yet her bad show is a total hit piece on metough great news that  has cancelled the additional debate how many times can the same people ask the same question i beat cruz debating crazy  supposedly had lyin' ted cruz on her show last night ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse ted can't win stuart stevens the failed campaign manager of mitt romney's historic loss is now telling the republican party what to do with trump sad i will be interviewed on the o'reilly factor this evening at 8 pm on the fox news channel  thank you missouri

carly fiorina- i agree ted cruz is just another politician all talk- no action thank you kevin with unification of the party republican wins will be massive  govkasich of ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television he only watches the  ohio govkasich voted for nafta from which ohio has never recovered now he wants tpp which will be even worse ohio steel and coal dying bernie sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events be careful bernie or my supporters will go to yours wow kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of pennsylvania not enough signatures big problem usss did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage he has ties to isis should be in jail  do the people of ohio know that john

i love you ohio  it is clinton and sanders people who disrupted my rally in chicago and then they say i must talk to my people phony politicians the last person that hillary or bernie want to run

cruz- as iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote   i will be interviewed on  at 7:00 pm enjoy  based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified and finally cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers voters that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and choice a total lie the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting votergrade of f and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz fraud many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud also cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters during primetime of the iowa caucus cruz put out a release that  was quitting the race and to caucus or vote for cruz ted cruz didn't win iowa he stole it that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated bad great job on  tonight    begged us for a job we said no and she went hostile a real dummy  on my way to new hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd     anybody who watched all of ted cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his howard dean moment    on  he finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro i don't believe i have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one i will keep doing but not worth it i will

voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how hillary abused those women hillary clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president jeb bush is a low energy individual but hillary is not much better hillary clinton said that it is ok to ban muslims from israel by building a wall but not ok to do so in the us we must be vigilant  is a low energy stiff who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls has no chance  is a sad case a total embarrassment to both himself and his family he just announced he will continue to spend on trump hit

thought i'd be saying this but i've really enjoyed   on television lately and he was terrific hosting  joe mcquaid  is desperately trying to sell the  it's a loser and my comments haven't helped him much the dying  newspaper in nh is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out iowa was fantastic last night amazing crowd and people i'm now in florida getting ready to go to south carolina big crowd very exciting    you were great on  last night thanks for the nice words make america great again thank you council bluffs iowa the silent majority is silent no more    joe mcquaid  of the dying union leader wanted ads lunches donations speeches from me and tweets---very unethical the great people of new hampshire who i love are not properly served by the dying union leader newspaper shows how dumb joe mcquaid  of the dying union leader is to put out the letter i wrote saying why i didn't do his failed debate i hope  does better for rubio than he did at the  hearings which were a total disaster for republicans  america we need a real president  looking forward to being in council bluffs iowa later today despite weather rally is on -- will be fantastic  so i have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place jeb bush has spent $59 million  done run country my way my campaign for president is $35000000 under budget i have spent very little and am in 1st placenow i will spend big in iowa/nh/sc minorities line up behinddonald trump      is terrific at hosting on  he really gets it remember that bill clinton was brought in to help hillary against obama in 2008 he was terrible failed badly and was called a racist thank you- nashua new hampshire       thank you    thank you to a  supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months video  strange but i see wacko bernie sanders allies coming over to me because i'm lowering taxes while he will double  triple them a disaster wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few  and people have lost faith in our leaderswe need smart and strong leadership now many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries we now are part time sad i will fix the middle-class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of and no  effective raise in years bad if hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women's card on me she's wrong hopefully the republican national committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in virginia's republican party fast straighten out the republican party of virginia before it is too late stupid  rnc  blew his campaign when he gave hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that i feel wages in america are too high lie the voters the republican party of virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory the dems love it be smart and win for a change rpvirginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row will now not allow desperately needed new voters suicidal mistake rnc must act now it begins republican party of virginia controlled by the rnc is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters bad i will do far more for women than hillary and i will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina thank you   hillary clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but he's demonstrated a penchant for sexism so inappropriate a new terror warning was issued for european cties at what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart weak leaders   story   criminal deportations in the us are the lowest number in many years we are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country must change the phoenix va it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before the wait is horrendous and people are dying i will fix it the same people that said i wouldn't run or that i wouldn't lead or do well 1st place and leading by 21percent now say i won't beat hillary  is so dishonest in his reportingand to think he was going off the air until i came along-no ratings i will beat hillary  just announced that trump was  story of 2015 totally meaningless however if we don't win it all and make america great again when will the democrats and hillary in particular say we must build a wall a great wall and mexico is going to pay for it never our great veterans are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the va that will stop i will fix this quickly remember when failed candidate  said that illegals came across the border as an act of love he's spent $59 million and is at 3percent we have many problems in our house country and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay make america great again does everyone see that the democrats and president obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally politics  was great today on   she gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly have her on more merry christmas to all have a great day and have a really amazing year together we will make america great again it will be done   great job on  today very wise indeed  why didn't you report hillary lying about the isis video bad reporting perhaps  will do better next year-but doubt it i am now in palm beach florida and will be going to church tonight make america great again  and  very dishonest in not showing the new  poll where i am at 39percent 21points higher than cruz be honest chuck why isn't  using the much newer  poll when discussing how well i am doing instead of the older q poll cnn even better wow because of the pressure put on by me ice to launch large scale deportation raids it's about time next year will be an interesting one i look forward to running against hillary clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly third rate reporters amy chozick and maggie haberman of the failing  are totally in the hillary circle of bias think about bill wow even lowly rand paul has just past  in the new  poll jeb is at 3percent i'm at 39percent stop throwing your money down the drain in the ridiculous  ad about me jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn't allow my answer which destroys him so sad poor  spent $50 million on his campaign i spent almost nothing he's bottom and gone i'm top by a lot that's what us needs a great christmas movie  perfect   story   hillary said i really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign i deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity merry christmas  happy holidays   hillary when you complain about a penchant for sexism who are you referring to i have great respect for women be careful it is hard to believe i am winning by so much when i am treated so badly by the media  new  poll amazing in all categories 21 pt lead why does  give  so much airtime he and other fox pundits is so biased still thinks romney won unfair coverage of trump  treats me so badly using old quinnipiac poll where i have a much smaller lead than the just out  poll all negative the  which is the lobbyist power for not imposing taxes on  today did a nasty cartoon attacking  kids bad the silent majority- is silent no more remember the importance of voting   the hillary clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic be careful hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card    thank you america together- we will   big news just out new  poll  trump  39 and leads in every major category likeability way up cruz 18  carson 10  rubio 10 we need a president with strength stamina heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again it is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong sad when i said that hillary clinton got schlonged by obama it meant got beaten badly the media knows this often used word in politics    wow new reuters poll just out big lead if you want to make america great again  trump 37  cruz 11 this is at the top of drudge for those on tv defending my use of the word schlonged bc  is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly dishonest  npr's  said schlonged to wapo re 1984 mondale/ferraro campaign that ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls  once again  is dishonest schlonged is not vulgar when i said hillary got schlonged that meant beaten badly jeb's big ad buy against me paid for by lobbyists shows my face but doesn't have me answering jeb's statements he is really pathetic watching  and consider  to be one of the least talented people on television boring and biased women defy media narrative love trump at packed michigan rallyvideo    opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around incoherent why doesn't  in his ads show my answer to his statement in the debate will  in his phony advertising campaign show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate  just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy will never work weak and low energy  whose campaign is a disaster is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy video from michigan last

debate isis is going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst she made up story-want apology very sad what happened last night at the miss universe pageant i sold it 6

poll out of illinois thank you    final 3 on now great people great new owner  watch my friend  of  bought the miss universe pageants from me and they are on tonight on  tune in it was really strange when hillary was missing from the podium last night not very presidential hillary clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no isis video of me therefore hillary lied at the debate last night sad  was terrible on face the nation today being at 2percent and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence a basket case we need a  with great strength  stamina hillary does not have that

listening to your ideas and thoughts i think it would be a good ideaand fairto include    in the debate both solid  good guys  carson now admits his friend named bob who he tried to stab bob was saved by his belt buckle no longer exists as bob wrong name with ben carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer stab a friend and pyramids built for grain storage don't people get it such bad reporting a puff piece on ben carson in the  states that carson is trying to solidify his lead but i am  easily sad florida ethics commission advocate comes down hard on rubio so do two people who worked with him said he used the wrong credit card sure a great honor to easily finish first in the  poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner the carson story is either a total fabrication or if true even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend rubio lied about my meeting w/ hispanic activists i didn't change my opinion but treated them w/ respect shame   should have corrected jeb bush when he said that i ran for president twice never ran merely considered running jeb bush just said about marco rubio he's my

terrible job as governor of new york if he ran again he would have lost in a landslide he and graham zero in polls jeb bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence it's not a fence jeb it's a wall and there's a big difference asians are very offended that jeb said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics a mess in a clumsy move to get out of his anchor babies dilemma where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it he blamed asians jeb bush never uses his last name on advertising signage materials etc is he ashamed of the name bush a pretty sad situation go jeb i liked the kelly file much better without  perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation  must have had a terrible vacation she is really

business times jeb bush got $13m job at lehman after florida shifted pension cash to bank thank you greta  even barbara bush agrees with me-  depression- be careful of china  markets are crashing all

taking the us market down get smart usa new reuters poll just came out and has me at 32percent highest number yetthe silent majority is back and we will make america great again the last thing we need is another bush in the white house would be the same old thing remember read my lips no more taxes greatness jeb bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body jeb just can't get it right jeb bush is weak on illegal immigration in favor of common core bad on women's health issues and thinks the iraq war was a good thing now that i started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border most other candidates are finally  speaking up just politicians it has just been confirmed by  the city of mobile alabama that there were
