homeland security travel ban and anyone even with bad intentions can come into us make america great again after being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election the fake news  is still lost the opinion of this so-called judge which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country is ridiculous and will be overturned interesting that certain middle-eastern countries agree with the ban they know if certain people are allowed in it's death  destruction when a country is no longer able to say who can and who cannot  come in  out especially for reasons of safety security big trouble countries charge us companies taxes or tariffs while the us charges them nothing or littlewe should charge them same as they charge us we must keep evil out

never have allowed this fake news to leak into the public one last shot at meare we living in nazi germany i win an election easily a great movement is verified and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with fake news a sorry state russia has never tried to use leverage over me i have nothing to do with russia no deals no loans no nothing russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is a complete and total fabrication utter nonsense very unfair buzzfeed runs unverifiable trump-russia claims'   fake news a total political witch hunt trump helps lift small business confidence to 12-yr high'  small business optimism soars after trump election'  us small-business optimism index surges by most since 1980' thank you to all of the men and women who protect  serve our communities 24/7/365   an old picture with nancy and ronald reagan  ford said last week that it will expand in michigan and us instead of building a billion dollar plant in mexico thank you ford  fiat c it's finally happening fiat chrysler just announced plans to invest $1billion in michigan and ohio plants adding 2000 jobs this after groveling when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad just more very dishonest media hillary flunky who lost big for the 100th time i never mocked a disabled reporter would never do that but simply showed him meryl streep one of the most over-rated actresses in hollywood doesn't know me but attacked last night at the golden globes she is a rupert murdoch is a great guy who likes me much better as a very successful candidate than he ever did as a very successful developer dishonest media says mexico won't be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly media is fake before i or anyone saw the classified and/or highly confidential hacking intelligence report it was leaked out to  so serious kellyanne conway went to  this morning for an interview with  dishonest media cut out 9 of her 10 minutes terrible i look very much forward to meeting prime minister theresa may in washington in the spring britain a longtime us ally is very special congratulation to jane timken on her major upset victory in becoming the ohio republican party chair jane is a loyal trump supporter  star both countries will perhaps work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the world have enough problems around the world without yet another one when i am president russia will respect us far more than they do now and having a good relationship with russia is a good thing not a bad thing only stupid people or fools would think that it is bad we only reason the hacking of the poorly defended dnc is discussed is that the loss by the dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results voting machines not touched gross negligence by the democratic national committee allowed hacking to take placethe republican national committee had strong defense happy birthday  monitoring the terrible situation in florida just spoke to governor scott thoughts and prayers for all stay safe i am asking the chairs of the house and senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with nbc prior to me seeing it anna wintour came to my office at trump tower to ask me to meet with the editors of conde nast  steven newhouse a friend will go this am being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14 now compare him to my season 1 but who cares he supported kasich  hillary wow the ratings are in and arnold schwarzenegger got swamped or destroyed by comparison to the ratings machine djt so much for hopefully all supporters and those who want to make america great again will go to dc on january 20th it will be a great show and knew they were in big trouble which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minutethey saw a movement like never before hillary and the dems were never going to beat the passion of my voters they saw what was happening in the last two weeks before the the dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the great wall for sake of speed will be paid back by mexico later so how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers what is going on the democratic national committee would not allow the fbi to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by russia how did nbc get an exclusive look into the top secret report he obama was presented who gave them this report and why politics toyota motor said will build a new plant in baja mexico to build corolla cars for us no way build plant in us or pay big border tax to make up their own minds as to the truth the media lies to make it look like i am against intelligence when in fact i am a big fan the dishonest media likes saying that i am in agreement with julian assange wrong i simply state what he states it is for the people time for republicans  democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works much less expensive  far better do the typical political thing and blame the fact is obamacare was a lie from the beginningkeep you doctor keep your plan it is the democrats lead by head clown chuck schumer know how bad obamacare is and what a mess they are in instead of working to fix it they jackie evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performancesome people just don't understand the movement massive increases of obamacare will take place this year and dems are to blame for the mess it will fall of its own weight be careful like the 116percent hike in arizona also deductibles are so high that it is practically useless don't let the schumer clowns out of this web republicans must be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases things they did and said like giving the questions to the debate to h a total double standard media as usual gave them a pass somebody hacked the dnc but why did they not have hacking defense like the rnc has and why have they not responded to the terrible thank you to ford for scrapping a new plant in mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the us this is just the beginning much more to follow julian assange said a 14 year old could have hacked podesta why was dnc so careless also said russians did not give him the info the intelligence briefing on so-called russian hacking was delayed until friday perhaps more time needed to build a case very strange i will be having a general news conference on january eleventh in nyc thank you trump is already delivering the jobs he promised america  there should be no further releases from gitmo these are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield instead of driving jobs and wealth away america will become the world's great magnet for innovation  job creation may be their number one act and priority focus on tax reform healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance  with all that congress has to work on do they really have to make the weakening of the independent ethics watchdog as unfair as it the democrat governorof minnesota said the affordable care act obamacare is no longer affordable and it is lousy healthcare people must remember that obamacare just doesn't work and it is not affordable 116percent increases arizona bill clinton called it crazy general motors is sending mexican made model of chevy cruze to us car dealers-tax free across border make in usaor pay big border tax china has been taking out massive amounts of money  wealth from the us in totally one-sided trade but won't help with north korea nice north korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the us it won't happen i thought and felt i would win big easily over the fabled 270 306 when they cancelled fireworks they knew and so did i various media

inflammatory president o statements and roadblocksthought it was going to be a smooth transition not the us consumer confidence index for december surged nearly four points to 1137 the highest level in more than 15 years thanks donald president obama campaigned hard and personally in the very important swing states and lostthe voters wanted to make america great again the djt foundation unlike most foundations never paid fees rent salaries or any expenses 100percent of money goes to wonderful charities i gave millions of dollars to djt foundation raised or recieved millions more all of

israel in the united nations will make it much harder to negotiate peacetoo bad but we will get it done anyway  purposely left out this part of my nuclear qoute until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes  dishonest vladimir putin said today about hillary and dems in my opinion it is humiliating one must be able to lose with dignity  so true slaughter you this is a purely religious threat which turned into reality such hatred when will the us and all countries fight back the terrorist who killed so many people in germany said just before crime by god's will we will slaughter you pigs i swear we will as to the un things will be different after jan 20th my presidency isn't this a ridiculous shame he loves these kids has raised millions of dollars for them and now

wanting tixs to the inauguration but look what they did for hillary nothing i want the people based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the lockheed martin f-35 i have asked boeing to price-out a comparable f-18 super hornet the united states must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes someone incorrectly stated that the phrase drain the swamp was no longer being used by me actually we will always be trying to dts the resolution being considered at the united nations security council regarding israel should be vetoedcont  i met some really great air force generals and navy admirals today talking about airplane capability and pricing very impressive people i have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that i spent far less money on the win than hillary on the loss i would have done even better in the election if that is possible if the winner was based on popular vote but would campaign differently campaigning to win the electoral college is much more difficult  sophisticated than the popular vote hillary focused on the wrong states yes it is true carlos slim the great businessman from mexico called me about getting together for a meeting we met he is a great guy especially how to get people even with an unlimited budget out to vote in the vital swing states  and more they focused on wrong states bill clinton stated that i called him after the election wrong he called me with a very nice congratulations he doesn't know much  we did it thank you to all of my great supporters we just officially won the election despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media today there were terror attacks in turkey switzerland and germany and it
