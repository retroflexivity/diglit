FAIR TRADE
Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today He was treated very unfairly by our government
Very good meetings with North Korea
Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative but they know it is not true
The corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people Spies (Informants) into my campaign Surveillance much
Iger where is my call of apology You and ABC have offended millions of people and they demand a response How is Brian Ross doing He tanked the market with an ABC lie yet no apology Double Standard
RUSH LIMBAUGH  If the FBI was so concerned and if they weren’t targeting Trump they should have told Trump If they were really concerned about the Russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax) then why not try to stop it Why not tell Trump Because they were pushing this scam
The recusal of Jeff Sessions was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States JOE DIGENOVA former US Attorney
The soon to be released book The Russia Hoax The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton And Frame Donald Trump written by Gregg Jarrett looks like a real deal big hit The Phony Witch Hunt will be opened up for the world to see Out in 5 weeks
Very importantly  will win for the Republicans in Novemberand his opponent will not Remember Alabama We can’t take any chances on losing to a Nancy Pelosi controlled Democrat
There is no one better to represent the people of NY and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than  who is strong on Borders  Crime loves our Military  our Vets voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again Dan has my full endorsement
Great meeting with  today talked about prison reform and sentencing 
Moments ago it was my great honor to sign  into law  
With the  Law I signed today patients with life threatening illnesses will finally have access to experimental treatments that could improve or even cure their conditions These are experimental treatments and products that have shown great promise 
Today I am proud to keep another promise to the American people as I sign the  Legislation into law 
Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that ABC does not tolerate comments like those made by Roseanne Barr Gee he never called President Donald J Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC Maybe I just didn’t get the call
The Failing and Corrupt  estimated the crowd last night at 1000 people when in fact it was many times that number and the arena was rockin’ This is the way they demean and disparage They are very dishonest people who don’t get me and never did
There are lots of really good lawyers in the country he could have picked somebody else And I wish I did
chief law enforcement officer and they told me later ‘oh by the way I’m not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office I would be frustrated tooand that’s how I read that Senator Sessions why didn’t you tell me before I picked you
RepTrey Gowdy I don’t think so I think what the President is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney General Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job not afterward If I were the President and I picked someone to be the country’s
The Fake Mainstream Media has from the time I announced I was running for President run the most highly sophisticated  dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics No matter how well WE do they find fault But the forgotten men  women WON I’m President
Sorry I’ve got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear bad Trade Deals VA Choice the Economy rebuilding the Military and so much more and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc
Why aren’t the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton It’s a Rigged Witch Hunt that’s why Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration
The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections especially now that Republicans (stay tough) are taking the lead in Polls There was no Collusion except by the Democrats
This investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about It wasn’t just a wiretap against a campaign aideit was secretly gathering information on the Trump Campaignpeople call that Spyingthis is unprecedented and  scandalous Mollie Hemingway
We have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit and more Kim Young Chol the Vice Chairman of North Korea heading now to New York Solid response to my letter thank you
Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad but backfires Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of countryBipartisan Bill
California has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime high tax problems along with so many others On June 5th vote for GOP Gubernatorial Candidate JOHN COX a really good and highly competent man He’ll Make California Great Again
A Democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to Repeal the GOP Tax Cuts (no chance) This is too good to be true for RepublicansRemember the Nancy Pelosi Dems are also weak on Crime the Border and want to be gentle and kind to MS-13 gang membersnot good
Our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny They saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served They cared for their families more than anything in the world they loved their families They inspired their communities 
The heroes who rest in these hallowed fields in cemeteries battlefields and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of American life They came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies from privilege and from poverty 
Thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance We are gathered here on the sacred soil of  Cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of America's greatest heroes the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom  
We now find out that the Obama Administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate or his campaign under investigation That raises legitimate questions I just find this really oddthis goes to the heart of our electoral system Jonathan Turley on 
Sally Yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the Justice Dept I find her actions to be really quite unbelievable Jonathan Turley
The President deserves some answers  in discussing SPYGATE
Happy Memorial Day Those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today Best economy in decades lowest unemployment numbers for Blacks and Hispanics EVER ( women in 18years) rebuilding our Military and so much more Nice
🇺🇸 
Why didn’t President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to upset the apple cart He was in charge not me and did nothing
Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this It will happen
Why didn’t the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton many crimes much Collusion with Russia Why didn’t the FBI take the Server from the DNC  Rigged Investigation
Fantastic to have 400000 GREAT MEN  WOMEN of Rolling Thunder in DC showing their patriotism They love our Country they love our Flag they stand for our National Anthem Thanks to Executive Director Artie Muller
Who’s going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt They journeyed down to Washington DC with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nationThey went back home in tatters
WELCOME HOME JOSH 
When will the 13 Angry Democrats ( those who worked for President O) reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest It’s been a long time now Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems Justice FBI  Russia
This whole Russia Probe is Rigged Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven’t been lost in decades 13 Angry Democrats and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years   CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
With Spies or Informants as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it’s not) all over my campaign even from a very early date why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the FBI or Justice contact me to tell me of the  phony Russia problem
The Failing  quotes a senior White House official who doesn’t exist as saying even if the meeting were reinstated holding it on June 12 would be impossible given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed WRONG AGAIN Use real people not phony sources
Unlike what the Failing and Corrupt New York Times would like people to believe there is ZERO disagreement within the Trump Administration as to  how to deal with North Koreaand if there was it wouldn’t matter The  has called me wrong right from the beginning
Thanks to very brave Teacher  Hero Jason Seaman of Noblesville Indiana for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives His quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world
Looking forward to seeing Joshua Holt this evening in the White House The great people of Utah are Celebrating
Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the US Catch and Release Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS
Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela Should be landing in DC this evening and be in the White House with his family at about 7:00 PM The great people of Utah will be very happy
We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which if it does happen will likely remain in Singapore on the same date June 12th and if necessary will be extended beyond that date
but complain and obstruct They made only bad deals (Iran) and their so-called Trade Deals are the laughing stock of the world
Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees change of management and board must purchase US parts and pay a $13 Billion fine Dems do nothing
Funny to watch the Democrats criticize Trade Deals being negotiated by me when they don’t even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the Obama Administration did NOTHING on trade except let other countries rip off the United States Lost almost $800 Billion/year under O
Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won’t let them do their job The killings are at a record pace and tough police work which Chicago will not allow would bring things back to order fastthe killings must stop
To the  Class of 2018 I say We know you are up to the task We know you will make us proud We know that glory will be yours Because you are WINNERS you are WARRIORS you are FIGHTERS you are CHAMPIONS and YOU will lead us to VICTORY God Bless the USA 
On behalf of the American People CONGRATULATIONS We love you 
Today it was my great honor to deliver the 2018 Commencement Address at the United States  in Annapolis Maryland CongratulationsGood luck Godspeed And ANCHORS AWEIGH 
Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea We will soon see where it will lead hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace Only time (and talent) will tell
Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs saying that they are individuals  must be nurtured or asking to end your big Tax Cuts  raise your taxes instead Dems have lost touch
Everyone knows there was a Spy and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a SpyWidespread Spying involving multiple people Mollie Hemingway The Federalist Senior Editor  But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story
Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign by the people and party in absolute power for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain And to think that the party in question even with the expenditure of far more money LOST
The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a Spy as illegal as that may be But what about an Informant who is paid a fortune and who sets up way earlier than the Russian Hoax
I will be making the Commencment Address today at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis Maryland Look forward to being with some of the greatest people on earth
Today it was my great honor to present the  to  (SEAL) Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Britt Slabinski in the East Room of the  Full ceremony  
Today it was my honor to sign  the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act Read more  
I have decided to terminate the planned Summit in Singapore on June 12th While many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially I believe that this is a tremendous setback for North Korea and indeed a setback for the world 
It was my great honor to host a roundtable re MS-13 yesterday in Bethpage New York Democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can SUPPORT law enforcement and SAVE innocent lives 
Sadly I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un 
Not surprisingly the GREAT Men  Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI 
Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign Large dollars were paid to the Spy far beyond normal Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in US history SPYGATE a terrible thing
Sadly I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jung Un 
Will be interviewed on  tomorrow morning at 6:00 AM Enjoy
Great to be in New York for the day Heading back to the  now lots of work to be done 
Thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in Bethpage New York Keep up the great work 
Crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled MS-13 gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities and Democrats in Congress REFUSE to close these loopholes including the disgraceful practice known as Catch-and-Release Democrats must abandon their resistance 
Today on Long Island we were all moved to be joined by families who have suffered unthinkable heartbreak at the hands of MS-13 I was truly honored to be joined again by the courageous families who were my guests at the State of the Union 
Thank you   
WITCH HUNT
There will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries you have waited long enough
Big legislation will be signed by me shortly After many years RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK
Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion
Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign No James Clapper I am not happy Spying on a campaign would be illegal and a scandal to boot
Everybody is with Tomi Lahren a truly outstanding and respected young woman 
SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history
It’s clear that they had eyes and ears all over the Trump Campaign Judge Andrew Napolitano
Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State They go after Phony Collusion with Russia a made up Scam and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before What goes around comes around
  New Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign Even Clapper worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head who has the problem of lying a lot used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities
Follow the money The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia because there was no Collusion He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win just like they did to Bernie Sanders who got duped
If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn’t a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered many times higher than normal
For the first time since Roe v Wade America has a Pro-Life President a Pro-Life Vice President a Pro-Life House of Representatives and 25 Pro-Life Republican State Capitals 
It was my honor to welcome  Cup Series Champion  and his team to the  yesterday 
Today it was my great honor to welcome President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea to the 🇺🇸🇰🇷 
 the great Governor of Arkansas is in a primary tomorrow He has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes border security and crime prevention Asa loves our military and our veterans I fully endorse Asa for Governor
Under our potential deal with China they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce
The Wall Street Journal asks WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA  A very good question
they then used to start an investigation about Trump It is that simple This guy is the genesis of this whole Debacle This was a Political hit job this was not an Intelligence Investigation Brennan has disgraced himself he’s worried about staying out of Jail Dan Bongino
top of the FBI Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump We now know that Brennan had detailed knowledge of the (phony) Dossierhe knows about the Dossier he denies knowledge of the Dossier he briefs the Gang of 8 on the Hill about the Dossier which
John Brennan is panicking He has disgraced himself he has disgraced the Country he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of American’s faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the
China must continue to be strong  tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in I want this to happen and North Korea to be VERY successful but only after signing
On China Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time
China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years
I ask Senator Chuck Schumer why didn’t President Obama  the Democrats do something about Trade with China including Theft of Intellectual Property etc They did NOTHING With that being said Chuck  I have long agreed on this issue Fair Trade plus with China will happen
I hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration
The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia so now they’re looking at the rest of the World Oh’ great
and why hasn’t the Podesta brother been charged and arrested like others after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington DC
What ever happened to the Server at the center of so much Corruption that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI They broke into homes  offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the Server
Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party Don’t worry about Dems FISA Abuse missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier
in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33000 Emails got $145000000 while Secretary of State paid McCabes wife $700000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam
At what point does this soon to be $20000000 Witch Hunt composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years STOP They have found no Collussion with Russia No Obstruction but they aren’t looking at the corruption
Things are really getting ridiculous The Failing and Crooked (but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton)  has done a long  boring story indicating that the World’s most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia  me so now they are looking at the rest of the World
If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers Drain the Swamp
Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House Melania is feeling and doing really well Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes

America is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance including more than 250 years worth of beautiful clean coal We have ended the war on coal and will continue to work to promote American energy dominance
California finally deserves a great Governor one who understands borders crime and lowering taxes John Cox is the man he’ll be the best Governor you’ve ever had I fully endorse John Cox for Governor and look forward to working with him to Make California Great Again
Just met with UN Secretary-General António Guterres who is working hard to Make the United Nations Great Again When the UN does more to solve conflicts around the world it means the US has less to do and we save money  is doing a fantastic job 
America is a Nation that believes in the power of redemption America is a Nation that believes in second chances and America is a Nation that believes that the best is always yet to come  
We grieve for the terrible loss of life and send our support and love to everyone affected by this horrible attack in Texas To the students families teachers and personnel at Santa Fe High School  we are with you in this tragic hour and we will be with you forever 
School shooting in Texas Early reports not looking good God bless all
Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted for political purposes into my campaign for president It took place very early on and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a hot Fake News story If true all time biggest political scandal
Why isn’t disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe’s wife in her run for office Then dropped case on Clinton
Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants or Illegal Immigrants Animals Wrong They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as Animals a big difference and so true Fake News got it purposely wrong as usual
Apparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign This has never been done before and by any means necessary they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn’t commit  David Asman      Really bad stuff
It was my great honor to visit with our HEROES last night at Walter Reed Medical Center There is nobody like them 
Tomorrow the House will vote on a strong Farm Bill which includes work requirements We must support our Nation’s great farmers

Congrats to the House for passing the VA MISSION Act yesterday Without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care Putting politics over our veterans care is UNACCEPTABLE  Senate must vote yes on this bill by Memorial Day
Despite the disgusting illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in US history by far Sorry to the Fake News Media and Haters but that’s the way it is
Wow word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT Andrew McCarthy says There’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign If so this is bigger than Watergate
Wow word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN IMBEDDED INFORMANT Andrew McCarthy says There’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign If so this is bigger than Watergate
Congratulations America we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American Historyand there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money
Gina Haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the CIA She is exceptionally qualified and the Senate should confirm her immediately We need her to keep our great country safe 
and voted against the massive Tax Cut Bill He’s also weak on borders and crime Sadly our great Military and Vets mean nothing to Bobby Jr Lou Barletta will win 
Lou Barletta will be a great Senator for Pennsylvania but his opponent Bob Casey has been a do-nothing Senator who only shows up at election time He votes along the Nancy Pelosi Elizabeth Warren lines loves sanctuary cities bad and expensive healthcare
Today it was my great honor to welcome President Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan to the  
House votes today on Choice/MISSION Act Who will stand with our Great Vets caregivers and Veterans Service Organizations Must get Choice passed by Memorial Day
haven’t even started yet The US has very little to give because it has given so much over the years China has much to give
We have not seen China’s demands yet which should be few in that previous US Administrations have done so poorly in negotiating China has seen our demands There has been no folding as the media would love people to believe the meetings
The Washington Post and CNN have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with China Nothing has happened with ZTE except as it pertains to the larger trade deal Our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China
Congratulations to Deb Fischer The people of Nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing and it showed up at the ballot box

Nebraska make sure you get out to the polls and VOTE for Deb Fischer today 
Can you believe that with all of the made up unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media together with the  $10000000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion) I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year Much of the Media may be corrupt but the People truly get it
Trade negotiations are continuing with China They have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the US for many years Stay tuned

The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over  exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible With that being said leakers are traitors and cowards and we will find out who they are
ZTE the large Chinese phone company buys a big percentage of individual parts from US companies This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi
 
Big day for Israel Congratulations
US Embassy opening in Jerusalem will be covered live on    Lead up to 9:00 AM (eastern) event has already begun A great day for Israel
So sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris At some point countries will have to open their eyes  see what is really going on This kind of sickness  hatred is not compatible with a loving peaceful  successful country Changes to our thought process on terror must be made
Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary Now that will not happen
China and the United States are working well together on trade but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China for so many years that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries But be cool it will all work out
President Xi of China and I are working together to give massive Chinese phone company ZTE a way to get back into business fast Too many jobs in China lost Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done
Happy Mother’s Day 
The Senate should get funding done before the August break or NOT GO HOME Wall and Border Security should be included Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations worst in history Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct all they know how to do STAY
Iran’s Military Budget is up more than 40percent since the Obama negotiated Nuclear Deal was reachedjust another indicator that it was all a big lie But not anymore
North Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th Thank you a very smart and gracious gesture
Why doesn’t the Fake News Media state that the Trump Administration’s Anti-Trust Division has been and is opposed to the ATT purchase of Time Warner in a currently ongoing Trial Such a disgrace in reporting
Big week next week when the American Embassy in Israel will be moved to Jerusalem Congratulations to all

The Fake News is working overtime Just reported that despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy  all things else 91percent of the Network News about me is negative (Fake) Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt Take away credentials
The Republican Party had a great night Tremendous voter energy and excitement and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in November The Economy is sooo strong and with Nancy Pelosi wanting to end the big Tax Cuts and Raise Taxes why wouldn’t we win
The Iran Deal is defective at its core If we do nothing we know what will happen In just a short time the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons 
Statement on the Iran Nuclear Deal

The United States does not need John Kerry’s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal  He was the one that created this MESS in the first place
Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections which is what the Democrats always intended Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late
Lisa Page who may hold the record for the most Emails in the shortest period of time (to her Lover Peter S) and attorney Baker are out at the FBI as part of the Probers getting caught Why is Peter S still there What a total mess Our Country has to get back to Business
Good luck to Ric Grenell our new Ambassador to Germany A great and talented guy he will represent our Country well
The Great Revolt by Salena Zito and Brad Todd does much to tell the story of our great Election victory The Forgotten Men  Women are forgotten no longer
The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injusticeand just wait ‘till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest
The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion Coordination or anything else with Russia So now the Probe says OK what else is there How about Obstruction for a made up phony crimeThere is no O it’s called Fighting Back
My highly respected nominee for CIA Director Gina Haspel has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists Think of that in these very dangerous times we have the most qualified person a woman who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror Win Gina
To the great people of West Virginia we have together a really great chance to keep making a big difference Problem is Don Blankenship currently running for Senate can’t win the General Election in your StateNo way Remember Alabama Vote Rep Jenkins or AG Morrisey

The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as Mr Magoo and Rod Rosenstein as Mr Peepers This is according to people with whom the president has spoken There are no such people and don’t know these charactersjust more Fake  Disgusting News to create ill will
James Comey’s Memos are Classified I did not Declassify them They belong to our Government Therefore he broke the law Additionally he totally made up many of the things he said I said and he is already a proven liar and leaker Where are Memos on Clinton Lynch  others

A message from Kim Jong Un North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missilesAlso will Shut down a nuclear test site in the country’s Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests Progress being made for all
James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council Therefore the Special Council was established based on an illegal act Really does everybody know what that means
Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails
North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site This is very good news for North Korea and the World big progress Look forward to our Summit

James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION Also he leaked classified information WOW Will the Witch Hunt continue
James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe under the bus Inspector General’s Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine
Sanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed We are doing a great job of law enforcement but things such as this make safety in America difficult
My thoughts prayers and condolences are with the families friends and colleagues of the two  deputies (HEROES) who lost their lives in the line of duty today
Mike Pompeo is outstanding First in his class at West Point A top student at Harvard Law School A success at whatever he has done We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP He will be a great Secretary of State
Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country
Democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government hence the American People They are slow walking all of my nominations hundreds of people At this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals

 Melania and I join the Nation in celebrating the life of Barbara Bush 
Slippery James Comey the worst FBI Director in history was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where by the way there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)
Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed Details of Summit are being worked out now Denuclearization will be a great thing for World but also for North Korea
A sketch years later about a nonexistent man A total con job playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it) 
There is a Revolution going on in California Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous crime infested  breeding concept Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border but the people of the State are not happy Want Security  Safety NOW
While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP I don’t like the deal for the United States Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work Bilateral deals are far more efficient profitable and better for OUR workers Look how bad WTO is to US
Pastor Andrew Brunson a fine gentleman and Christian leader in the United States is on trial and being persecuted in Turkey for no reason They call him a Spy but I am more a Spy than he is Hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs

 Melania and I join the Nation in celebrating the life of Barbara Bush 
States and Cities throughout our Country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers Very unfair to traditional tax paying stores
Congress  House and Senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society Keep America Safe

Welcome Prime Minister Abe 
Rasmussen just came out at 51percent Approval despite the Fake News Media They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day Just about the most inaccurate were CNN and ABC News/Washington Post and they haven’t changed (get new pollsters) Much of the media is a Scam
Getting ready to meet Prime Minister Abe of Japan a truly fine gentleman
So many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill Everyone is talking really nice to see
Looks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous Border He cannot come to terms for the National Guard to patrol and protect the Border The high crime rate will only get higher Much wanted Wall in San Diego already started
I am in Florida and looking forward to my meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan Working on Trade and Military Security
Employment is up Taxes are DOWN Enjoy
Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the US keeps raising interest rates Not acceptable
Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G) then based his decisions on her poll numbers Disgruntled he McCabe and the others committed many crimes
Just hit 50percent in the Rasmussen Poll much higher than President Obama at same point With all of the phony stories and Fake News it’s hard to believe Thank you America we are doing Great Things
Slippery James Comey a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart) will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history by far
Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past I have many (too many) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices and even homes are going to be raided with everything including their phones and computers taken All lawyers are deflated and concerned
I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty I hardly even knew this guy Just another of his many lies His memos are self serving and FAKE
The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term Mission Accomplished I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term it should be brought back Use often
Comey throws AG Lynch under the bus Why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch Was she promised a Supreme Court seat or AG in order to lay off Hillary No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)
The big questions in Comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like how come he gave up Classified Information (jail) why did he lie to Congress (jail) why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it) why the phony memos McCabe’s $700000  more
Unbelievably James Comey states that Polls where Crooked Hillary was leading were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe In other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job Slimeball
So proud of our great Military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the finest that our Country has ever had There won’t be anything or anyone even close
A perfectly executed strike last night Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military Could not have had a better result Mission Accomplished
DOJ just issued the McCabe report which is a total disaster He LIED LIED LIED McCabe was totally controlled by Comey McCabe is Comey No collusion all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes
We are bringing back our factories we are bringing back our jobs and we are bringing back those four beautiful words MADE IN THE USA 
untruthful slime ball who was as time has proven a terrible Director of the FBI His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case and the events surrounding it will go down as one of the worst botch jobs of history It was my great honor to fire James Comey
James Comey is a proven LEAKER  LIAR Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was in fact fired He leaked CLASSIFIED information for which he should be prosecuted He lied to Congress under OATH He is a weak and
Tremendous pressure is building like never before for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities Started the Wall in San Diego where the people were pushing really hard to get it They will soon be protected

Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake  Corrupt Russia Investigation headed up by the all Democrat loyalists or people that worked for Obama Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA  Comey letter) No Collusion so they go crazy
Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the Cold War There is no reason for this Russia needs us to help with their economy something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together Stop the arms race
Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria Get ready Russia  because they will be coming nice and new and smart You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it
doing things that nobody thought possible despite the never ending and corrupt Russia Investigation which takes tremendous time and focus No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back) so now they do the Unthinkable and RAID a lawyers office for information BAD
So much Fake News about what is going on in the White House Very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with China the coming North Korea meeting and of course the vicious gas attack in Syria Feels great to have Bolton  Larry K on board I (we) are
The Failing New York Times wrote another phony story It was political pundit Doug Schoen not a Ukrainian businessman who asked me to do a short speech by phone (Skype) hosted by Doug in Ukraine I was very positive about Ukraine-another negative to the Fake Russia  C story

When a car is sent to the United States from China there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2percent When a car is sent to China from the United States there is a Tariff to be paid of 25percent Does that sound like free or fair trade  No it sounds like STUPID TRADE  going on for years
Congratulations to Patrick Reed on his great and courageous MASTERS win When Patrick had his amazing win at Doral 5 years ago people saw his great talent and a bright future ahead Now he is the Masters Champion

Lawmakers of the House Judiciary Committee are angrily accusing the Department of Justice of missing the Thursday Deadline for turning over UNREDACTED Documents relating to FISA abuse FBI Comey Lynch McCabe Clinton Emails and much more Slow walking what is going on BAD
We are sealing up our Southern Border The people of our great country want Safety and Security The Dems have been a disaster on this very important issue

China which is a great economic power is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages especially over the US Does anybody think this is fair We were badly represented The WTO is unfair to US

The Fake News Washington Post Amazon’s chief lobbyist has another (of many) phony headlines Trump Defiant As China Adds Trade Penalties WRONG Should read Trump Defiant as US Adds Trade Penalties Will End Barriers And Massive  IP Theft Typically bad reporting
The Caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of Mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our Border Because of the Trump Administrations actions Border crossings are at a still UNACCEPTABLE 46 year low Stop drugs

I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer Many billions of dollars PO leaders don’t have a clue (or do they)
Thank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling Just hit 50percent which is higher than Cheatin’ Obama at the same time in his Administration
Check out the fact that you can’t get a job at ratings challenged  unless you state that you are totally anti-Trump Little Jeff Zuker whose job is in jeopardy is not having much fun lately They should clean up and strengthen CNN and get back to honest reporting
The big Caravan of People from Honduras now coming across Mexico and heading to our Weak Laws Border had better be stopped before it gets there Cash cow NAFTA is in play as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen Congress MUST ACT NOW
The Fake News Networks those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast The Fakers at CNN NBC ABC  CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction
  
President Trump's approval rate among likely US voters hit 50 percent on Monday which puts him higher than former President Barack Obama's score at the same point into his first term according to a new poll Via   
39percent of my nominations including Diplomats to foreign lands have not been confirmed due to Democrat obstruction and delay At this rate it would take more than 7 years before I am allowed to have these great people start working Never happened before Disgraceful
Honduras Mexico and many other countries that the US is very generous to sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES Caravans are heading here Must pass tough laws and build the WALL Democrats allow open borders drugs and crime
As ridiculous as it sounds the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from A whole big wasted procedure must take place Mexico  Canada have tough immigration laws whereas ours are an Obama joke ACT CONGRESS

Only fools or worse are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon THEY LOSE A FORTUNE and this will be changed Also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the countrynot a level playing field
So funny to watch Fake News Networks among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC which is a total joke
Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTAThey have very strong border laws ours are pathetic With all of the money they make from the US hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until Congress changes our immigration laws
DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon No longer works Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation Democrats want No Borders hence drugs and crime
Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation use Nuclear Option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT but the weak Dem laws don’t allow them to do their job Act now Congress our country is being stolen
Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large Caravans of people enter their country They must stop them at their Northern Border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws
These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA They want in on the act
Mexico is doing very little if not NOTHING at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border and then into the US They laugh at our dumb immigration laws They must stop the big drug and people flows or I will stop their cash cow NAFTA NEED WALL
Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch  Release Getting more dangerous Caravans coming Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW NO MORE DACA DEAL
HAPPY EASTER

does not include the Fake Washington Post which is used as a lobbyist and should so  REGISTER If the PO increased its parcel rates Amazon’s shipping costs would rise by $26 Billion This Post Office scam must stop Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now
While we are on the subject it is reported that the US Post Office will lose $150 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon That amounts to Billions of Dollars The Failing NY Times reports that the size of the company’s lobbying staff has ballooned and that

As a matter of National Security I've signed the Omnibus Spending Bill I say to Congress I will NEVER sign another bill like this again To prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills 
Obama Administration legalized bump stocks BAD IDEA As I promised today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns
News conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill  1:00 PM
I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL which is desperately needed for our National Defense is not fully funded
DACA was abandoned by the Democrats Very unfair to them Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall

Special Council is told to find crimes whether a crime exists or not I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council I am still opposed to it I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because
there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime collusion or otherwise or obstruction of justice  So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz
Special Council is told to find crimes wether crimes exist or not I was opposed the the selection of Mueller to be Special Council I still am opposed to it I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because

Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date Same with lying James Comey Can we call them Fake Memos
Wow watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked have you ever been an anonymous sourceor known someone else to be an anonymous source He said strongly never no He lied as shown clearly on 
The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign WITCH HUNT
The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught called out and fired How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by Crooked H friend Terry M who was also under investigation How many lies How many leaks Comey knew it all and much more
As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign As many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI Justice  State 
Happy  
Andrew McCabe FIRED a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI A great day for Democracy Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI
