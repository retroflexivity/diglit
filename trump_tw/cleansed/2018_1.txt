fair trade will be giving a full pardon to dinesh d'souza today he was treated very unfairly by our government very good meetings with north korea not that it matters but i never fired james comey because of russia the corrupt mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative but they know it is not true the corrupt mainstream media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people spies informants into my campaign surveillance much iger where is my call of apology you and abc have offended millions of people and they demand a response how is brian ross doing he tanked the market with an abc lie yet no apology double standard rush limbaugh  if the fbi was so concerned and if they weren't targeting trump they should have told trump if they were really concerned about the russians infiltrating a campaign hoax then why not try to stop it why not tell trump because they were pushing this scam the recusal of jeff sessions was an unforced betrayal of the president of the united states joe digenova former us attorney the soon to be released book the russia hoax the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump written by gregg jarrett looks like a real deal big hit the phony witch hunt will be opened up for the world to see out in 5 weeks very importantly  will win for the republicans in novemberand his opponent will not remember alabama we can't take any chances on losing to a nancy pelosi controlled democrat there is no one better to represent the people of ny and staten island a place i know very well than  who is strong on borders  crime loves our military  our vets voted for tax cuts and is helping me to make america great again dan has my full endorsement great meeting with  today talked about prison reform and sentencing  moments ago it was my great honor to sign  into law   with the  law i signed today patients with life threatening illnesses will finally have access to experimental treatments that could improve or even cure their conditions these are experimental treatments and products that have shown great promise  today i am proud to keep another promise to the american people as i sign the  legislation into law  bob iger of abc called valerie jarrett to let her know that abc does not tolerate comments like those made by roseanne barr gee he never called president donald j trump to apologize for the horrible statements made and said about me on abc maybe i just didn't get the call the failing and corrupt  estimated the crowd last night at 1000 people when in fact it was many times that number and the arena was rockin' this is the way they demean and disparage they are very dishonest people who don't get me and never did there are lots of really good lawyers in the country he could have picked somebody else and i wish i did chief law enforcement officer and they told me later ‘oh by the way i'm not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office i would be frustrated tooand that's how i read that senator sessions why didn't you tell me before i picked you reptrey gowdy i don't think so i think what the president is doing is expressing frustration that attorney general sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job not afterward if i were the president and i picked someone to be the country's the fake mainstream media has from the time i announced i was running for president run the most highly sophisticated  dishonest disinformation campaign in the history of politics no matter how well we do they find fault but the forgotten men  women won i'm president sorry i've got to start focusing my energy on north korea nuclear bad trade deals va choice the economy rebuilding the military and so much more and not on the rigged russia witch hunt that should be investigating clinton/russia/fbi/justice/obama/comey/lynch etc why aren't the 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats investigating the totally crooked campaign of totally crooked hillary clinton it's a rigged witch hunt that's why ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration the 13 angry democrats plus people who worked 8 years for obama working on the rigged russia witch hunt will be meddling with the mid-term elections especially now that republicans stay tough are taking the lead in polls there was no collusion except by the democrats this investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about it wasn't just a wiretap against a campaign aideit was secretly gathering information on the trump campaignpeople call that spyingthis is unprecedented and  scandalous mollie hemingway we have put a great team together for our talks with north korea meetings are currently taking place concerning summit and more kim young chol the vice chairman of north korea heading now to new york solid response to my letter thank you democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from obama's term showing children from the border in steel cages they thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad but backfires dems must agree to wall and new border protection for good of countrybipartisan bill california has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime high tax problems along with so many others on june 5th vote for gop gubernatorial candidate john cox a really good and highly competent man he'll make california great again a democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to repeal the gop tax cuts no chance this is too good to be true for republicansremember the nancy pelosi dems are also weak on crime the border and want to be gentle and kind to ms-13 gang membersnot good our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny they saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served they cared for their families more than anything in the world they loved their families they inspired their communities  the heroes who rest in these hallowed fields in cemeteries battlefields and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of american life they came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies from privilege and from poverty  thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance we are gathered here on the sacred soil of  cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of america's greatest heroes the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom   we now find out that the obama administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate or his campaign under investigation that raises legitimate questions i just find this really oddthis goes to the heart of our electoral system jonathan turley on  sally yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the justice dept i find her actions to be really quite unbelievable jonathan turley the president deserves some answers  in discussing spygate happy memorial day those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today best economy in decades lowest unemployment numbers for blacks and hispanics ever  women in 18years rebuilding our military and so much more nice 🇺🇸  why didn't president obama do something about the so-called russian meddling when he was told about it by the fbi before the election because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didn't want to upset the apple cart he was in charge not me and did nothing our united states team has arrived in north korea to make arrangements for the summit between kim jong un and myself i truly believe north korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial nation one day kim jong un agrees with me on this it will happen why didn't the 13 angry democrats investigate the campaign of crooked hillary clinton many crimes much collusion with russia why didn't the fbi take the server from the dnc  rigged investigation fantastic to have 400000 great men  women of rolling thunder in dc showing their patriotism they love our country they love our flag they stand for our national anthem thanks to executive director artie muller who's going to give back the young and beautiful lives and others that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony russia collusion witch hunt they journeyed down to washington dc with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nationthey went back home in tatters welcome home josh  when will the 13 angry democrats  those who worked for president o reveal their disqualifying conflicts of interest it's been a long time now will they be indelibly written into the report along with the fact that the only collusion is with the dems justice fbi  russia this whole russia probe is rigged just an excuse as to why the dems and crooked hillary lost the election and states that haven't been lost in decades 13 angry democrats and all dems if you include the people who worked for obama for 8 years   conflicts of interest with spies or informants as the democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister but it's not all over my campaign even from a very early date why didn't the crooked highest levels of the fbi or justice contact me to tell me of the  phony russia problem the failing  quotes a senior white house official who doesn't exist as saying even if the meeting were reinstated holding it on june 12 would be impossible given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed wrong again use real people not phony sources unlike what the failing and corrupt new york times would like people to believe there is zero disagreement within the trump administration as to  how to deal with north koreaand if there was it wouldn't matter the  has called me wrong right from the beginning thanks to very brave teacher  hero jason seaman of noblesville indiana for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives his quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world looking forward to seeing joshua holt this evening in the white house the great people of utah are celebrating put pressure on the democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the border into the us catch and release lottery and chain must also go with it and we must continue building the wall democrats are protecting ms-13 thugs good news about the release of the american hostage from venezuela should be landing in dc this evening and be in the white house with his family at about 7:00 pm the great people of utah will be very happy we are having very productive talks with north korea about reinstating the summit which if it does happen will likely remain in singapore on the same date june 12th and if necessary will be extended beyond that date but complain and obstruct they made only bad deals iran and their so-called trade deals are the laughing stock of the world senator schumer and obama administration let phone company zte flourish with no security checks i closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees change of management and board must purchase us parts and pay a $13 billion fine dems do nothing funny to watch the democrats criticize trade deals being negotiated by me when they don't even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the obama administration did nothing on trade except let other countries rip off the united states lost almost $800 billion/year under o chicago police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won't let them do their job the killings are at a record pace and tough police work which chicago will not allow would bring things back to order fastthe killings must stop to the  class of 2018 i say we know you are up to the task we know you will make us proud we know that glory will be yours because you are winners you are warriors you are fighters you are champions and you will lead us to victory god bless the usa  on behalf of the american people congratulations we love you  today it was my great honor to deliver the 2018 commencement address at the united states  in annapolis maryland congratulationsgood luck godspeed and anchors aweigh  very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from north korea we will soon see where it will lead hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace only time and talent will tell democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with north korea just like they are coming to the defense of ms 13 thugs saying that they are individuals  must be nurtured or asking to end your big tax cuts  raise your taxes instead dems have lost touch everyone knows there was a spy and in fact the people who were involved in the spying are admitting that there was a spywidespread spying involving multiple people mollie hemingway the federalist senior editor  but the corrupt mainstream media hates this monster story can anyone even imagine having spies placed in a competing campaign by the people and party in absolute power for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain and to think that the party in question even with the expenditure of far more money lost the democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing party's campaign is different than having a spy as illegal as that may be but what about an informant who is paid a fortune and who sets up way earlier than the russian hoax i will be making the commencment address today at the united states naval academy in annapolis maryland look forward to being with some of the greatest people on earth today it was my great honor to present the  to  seal master chief special warfare operator britt slabinski in the east room of the  full ceremony   today it was my honor to sign  the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act read more   i have decided to terminate the planned summit in singapore on june 12th while many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially i believe that this is a tremendous setback for north korea and indeed a setback for the world  it was my great honor to host a roundtable re ms-13 yesterday in bethpage new york democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can support law enforcement and save innocent lives  sadly i was forced to cancel the summit meeting in singapore with kim jong un  not surprisingly the great men  women of the fbi are starting to speak out against comey mccabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the fbi comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the fbi  clapper has now admitted that there was spying in my campaign large dollars were paid to the spy far beyond normal starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in us history spygate a terrible thing sadly i was forced to cancel the summit meeting in singapore with kim jung un  will be interviewed on  tomorrow morning at 6:00 am enjoy great to be in new york for the day heading back to the  now lots of work to be done  thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in bethpage new york keep up the great work  crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled ms-13 gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities and democrats in congress refuse to close these loopholes including the disgraceful practice known as catch-and-release democrats must abandon their resistance  today on long island we were all moved to be joined by families who have suffered unthinkable heartbreak at the hands of ms-13 i was truly honored to be joined again by the courageous families who were my guests at the state of the union  thank you    witch hunt there will be big news coming soon for our great american autoworkers after many decades of losing your jobs to other countries you have waited long enough big legislation will be signed by me shortly after many years right to try and big changes to dodd frank our trade deal with china is moving along nicely but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion trump should be happy that the fbi was spying on his campaign no james clapper i am not happy spying on a campaign would be illegal and a scandal to boot everybody is with tomi lahren a truly outstanding and respected young woman  spygate could be one of the biggest political scandals in history it's clear that they had eyes and ears all over the trump campaign judge andrew napolitano look how things have turned around on the criminal deep state they go after phony collusion with russia a made up scam and end up getting caught in a major spy scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before what goes around comes around   new bombshell in the obama spying scandal did other agencies spy on trump campaign even clapper worlds dumbest former intelligence head who has the problem of lying a lot used the word spy when describing the illegal activities follow the money the spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported collusion with russia because there was no collusion he was only there to spy for political reasons and to help crooked hillary win just like they did to bernie sanders who got duped if the person placed very early into my campaign wasn't a spy put there by the previous administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered many times higher than normal for the first time since roe v wade america has a pro-life president a pro-life vice president a pro-life house of representatives and 25 pro-life republican state capitals  it was my honor to welcome  cup series champion  and his team to the  yesterday  today it was my great honor to welcome president moon jae-in of the republic of korea to the 🇺🇸🇰🇷   the great governor of arkansas is in a primary tomorrow he has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes border security and crime prevention asa loves our military and our veterans i fully endorse asa for governor under our potential deal with china they will purchase from our great american farmers practically as much as our farmers can produce the wall street journal asks where in the world was barack obama  a very good question they then used to start an investigation about trump it is that simple this guy is the genesis of this whole debacle this was a political hit job this was not an intelligence investigation brennan has disgraced himself he's worried about staying out of jail dan bongino top of the fbi brennan started this entire debacle about president trump we now know that brennan had detailed knowledge of the phony dossierhe knows about the dossier he denies knowledge of the dossier he briefs the gang of 8 on the hill about the dossier which john brennan is panicking he has disgraced himself he has disgraced the country he has disgraced the entire intelligence community he is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of american's faith in the intelligence community and in some people at the china must continue to be strong  tight on the border of north korea until a deal is made the word is that recently the border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in i want this to happen and north korea to be very successful but only after signing on china barriers and tariffs to come down for first time china has agreed to buy massive amounts of additional farm/agricultural products would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years i ask senator chuck schumer why didn't president obama  the democrats do something about trade with china including theft of intellectual property etc they did nothing with that being said chuck  i have long agreed on this issue fair trade plus with china will happen i hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the department of justice look into whether or not the fbi/doj infiltrated or surveilled the trump campaign for political purposes and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the obama administration the witch hunt finds no collusion with russia so now they're looking at the rest of the world oh' great and why hasn't the podesta brother been charged and arrested like others after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm is it because he is a very well connected democrat working in the swamp of washington dc what ever happened to the server at the center of so much corruption that the democratic national committee refused to hand over to the hard charging except in the case of democrats fbi they broke into homes  offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the server now that the witch hunt has given up on russia and is looking at the rest of the world they should easily be able to take it into the mid-term elections where they can put some hurt on the republican party don't worry about dems fisa abuse missing emails or fraudulent dossier in the hillary clinton campaign where she deleted 33000 emails got $145000000 while secretary of state paid mccabes wife $700000 and got off the fbi hook along with terry m and so much more republicans and real americans should start getting tough on this scam at what point does this soon to be $20000000 witch hunt composed of 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats and two people who have worked for obama for 8 years stop they have found no collussion with russia no obstruction but they aren't looking at the corruption things are really getting ridiculous the failing and crooked but not as crooked as hillary clinton  has done a long  boring story indicating that the world's most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia  me so now they are looking at the rest of the world if the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal only the release or review of documents that the house intelligence committee also senate judiciary is asking for can give the conclusive answers drain the swamp great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house melania is feeling and doing really well thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes happy  to our great military men and women for their selfless service to our nation  great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house melanie is feeling and doing really well thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes america is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance including more than 250 years worth of beautiful clean coal we have ended the war on coal and will continue to work to promote american energy dominance california finally deserves a great governor one who understands borders crime and lowering taxes john cox is the man he'll be the best governor you've ever had i fully endorse john cox for governor and look forward to working with him to make california great again just met with un secretary-general antónio guterres who is working hard to make the united nations great again when the un does more to solve conflicts around the world it means the us has less to do and we save money  is doing a fantastic job  america is a nation that believes in the power of redemption america is a nation that believes in second chances and america is a nation that believes that the best is always yet to come   we grieve for the terrible loss of life and send our support and love to everyone affected by this horrible attack in texas to the students families teachers and personnel at santa fe high school  we are with you in this tragic hour and we will be with you forever  school shooting in texas early reports not looking good god bless all reports are there was indeed at least one fbi representative implanted for political purposes into my campaign for president it took place very early on and long before the phony russia hoax became a hot fake news story if true all time biggest political scandal why isn't disgraced fbi official andrew mccabe being investigated for the $700000 crooked hillary democrats in virginia led by clinton best friend terry m under fbi investigation that they killed gave to mccabe's wife in her run for office then dropped case on clinton fake news media had me calling immigrants or illegal immigrants animals wrong they were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories i referred to ms 13 gang members as animals a big difference and so true fake news got it purposely wrong as usual apparently the doj put a spy in the trump campaign this has never been done before and by any means necessary they are out to frame donald trump for crimes he didn't commit  david asman      really bad stuff it was my great honor to visit with our heroes last night at walter reed medical center there is nobody like them  tomorrow the house will vote on a strong farm bill which includes work requirements we must support our nation's great farmers great talk with my friend president mauricio macri of argentina this week he is doing such a good job for argentina i support his vision for transforming his country's economy and unleashing its potential talking trade with the vice premier of the people's republic of china liu he  congratulations to our new cia director gina haspel  congrats to the house for passing the va mission act yesterday without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care putting politics over our veterans care is unacceptable  senate must vote yes on this bill by memorial day despite the disgusting illegal and unwarranted witch hunt we have had the most successful first 17 month administration in us history by far sorry to the fake news media and haters but that's the way it is wow word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi spied on the trump campaign with an embedded informant andrew mccarthy says there's probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign if so this is bigger than watergate wow word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi spied on the trump campaign with an imbedded informant andrew mccarthy says there's probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign if so this is bigger than watergate congratulations america we are now into the second year of the greatest witch hunt in american historyand there is still no collusion and no obstruction the only collusion was that done by democrats who were unable to win an election despite the spending of far more money gina haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the cia she is exceptionally qualified and the senate should confirm her immediately we need her to keep our great country safe  and voted against the massive tax cut bill he's also weak on borders and crime sadly our great military and vets mean nothing to bobby jr lou barletta will win  lou barletta will be a great senator for pennsylvania but his opponent bob casey has been a do-nothing senator who only shows up at election time he votes along the nancy pelosi elizabeth warren lines loves sanctuary cities bad and expensive healthcare today it was my great honor to welcome president mirziyoyev of uzbekistan to the   house votes today on choice/mission act who will stand with our great vets caregivers and veterans service organizations must get choice passed by memorial day haven't even started yet the us has very little to give

china nothing has happened with zte except as it pertains to the larger trade deal our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with china congratulations to deb fischer the people of nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing and it showed up at the ballot box  congratulations to lou barletta of pennsylvania he will be a great senator and will represent his people

order to make us look as bad as possible with that being said leakers are traitors and cowards and we will find out who they are zte the large chinese phone company buys a big percentage of individual parts from us companies this is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with china and my personal relationship with president xi   big day for israel congratulations us embassy opening in jerusalem will be covered live on    lead up to 9:00 am eastern event has already begun a great day for israel so sad to see the terror attack in paris at some point countries will have to open their eyes  see what is really going on this kind of sickness  hatred is not compatible with a loving peaceful  successful country changes to our thought process on terror must be made remember how badly iran was behaving with the iran deal in place they were trying to take over the middle east by whatever means necessary now that will not happen china and the united states are working well together on trade but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of china for so many years that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries but be cool it will all work out president xi of china and i are working together to give massive chinese phone company zte a way to get back into business fast too many jobs in china lost commerce department has been instructed to get it done happy mother's day  the senate should get funding done before the august break or not go home wall and border security should be included also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations worst in history democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct all they know how to do stay iran's military budget is up more than 40percent since the obama negotiated nuclear deal was reachedjust another indicator that it was all a big lie but not anymore north korea has announced that they will dismantle nuclear test site this month ahead of the big summit meeting on june 12th

shut down a nuclear test site in the country's northern side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests progress being made for all james comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a special council therefore the special council was established based on an illegal act really does everybody know what that means just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist democrats this can be good news in that we will now counter for the dnc server that they refused to give to the fbi the debbie wasserman schultz servers and documents held by the pakistani mystery man and clinton emails north korea has agreed to suspend all nuclear tests and close up a major test site this is very good news for north korea and the world big progress look

election day the american public is wise to the phony an dishonest press make america great again looks like opec is at it again with record amounts of oil all over the place including the fully loaded ships at sea oil prices are artificially very high no good and will not be accepted nancy pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big tax cuts given to the american people by the

general michael flynn's life can be totally destroyed while shadey james comey can leak and lie and make lots of money from a third rate book that should never have been written is that really the way life in america is supposed to work i don't think so james comey memos just out and show clearly that there was no collusion and no obstruction also he leaked classified information wow will the witch hunt continue james comey just threw andrew mccabe under the bus inspector general's report on mccabe is a disaster for both of them getting a little lot of their own medicine sanctuary cities released at least 142 gang members across the united states making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed we are doing a great job of law enforcement but things such as this make safety in america difficult my thoughts prayers and condolences are with the families friends and colleagues of the two  deputies heroes who lost their lives in the line of duty today mike pompeo is outstanding first in his class at west point a top student at harvard law school a success at whatever he has done we need the senate to approve mike asap he will be a great secretary of state hopefully the senate will not leave washington until our ambassadors judges and the people who make washington work are approved the democrats are obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our country democrats are obstructing good hopefully great people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our government hence the american people they are slow walking all of my nominations hundreds of people at this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals  is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her great on the military border security and crime loves and works hard for the people of tennessee she has my full endorsement and i will be there to campaign with her thank you    and  keep up the great work  just arrived  heading to a briefing with the joint interagency task force south northcom and southcom  governor jerry brown announced he will deploy up to 400 national guard troops to do nothing the crime rate in california is high enough and the federal government will not be paying for governor brown's charade we need border security and action not words thank you san diego county for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against california's illegal and unconstitutional 'sanctuary' policies california's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our

the nation in celebrating the life of barbara bush  slippery james comey the worst fbi director in history was not fired because of the phony russia investigation where by the way there was no collusion except by the dems mike pompeo met with kim jong un in north korea last week meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed details of summit are being worked out now denuclearization will be a great thing for world but also for north korea a sketch years later about a nonexistent man a total con job playing the fake news media for fools but they know it  there is a revolution going on in california soooo many sanctuary areas want out of this ridiculous crime infested  breeding concept jerry brown is trying to back out of the national guard at the border but the people of the state are not happy want security  safety now while japan and south korea would like us to go back into tpp i don't like the deal for the united states too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn't work bilateral deals are far more efficient profitable and better for our workers look how bad wto is to us pastor andrew brunson a fine gentleman and christian leader in the united states is on trial and being persecuted in turkey for no reason they call him a spy but i am more a spy than he is hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs it is my great honor to host     melania and i join the nation in celebrating the life of barbara bush  states and cities throughout our country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers very unfair to traditional tax paying stores congress  house and senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society keep america safe today's court decision means that congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens including aggravated felons this is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by welcome prime minister abe  rasmussen just came out at 51percent approval despite the fake news media they were one of the three most accurate on election day just about the most inaccurate were cnn and abc news/washington post and they haven't changed get new pollsters much of the media is a scam getting ready to meet prime minister abe of japan a truly fine gentleman so many people are seeing the benefits of the tax cut bill everyone is talking really nice to see looks like jerry brown and california are not looking for safety and security along their very porous border he cannot come to terms for the national guard to patrol and protect the border the high crime rate will only get higher much wanted wall in san diego already started i am in florida and looking forward to my meeting with prime minister abe of japan working on trade and military security employment is up taxes are down enjoy russia and china are playing the currency devaluation game as the us keeps raising interest rates not acceptable comey drafted the crooked hillary exoneration long before he talked to her lied in congress to senator g then based his decisions on her poll numbers disgruntled he mccabe and the others committed many crimes just hit 50percent in the rasmussen poll much higher than president obama at same point with all of the phony stories and fake news it's hard to believe thank you america we are doing great things slippery james comey a man who always ends up badly and out of whack he is not smart will go down as the worst fbi director in history by far attorney client privilege is now a thing of the past i have many too many lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices and even homes are going to be raided with everything including their phones and computers taken all lawyers are deflated and concerned i never asked comey for personal loyalty i hardly even knew this guy just another of his many lies his memos are self serving and fake the syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the fake news media could demean was by my use of the term mission accomplished i knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great military term it should be brought back use often comey throws ag lynch under the bus why can't we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with wild bill and lynch was she promised a supreme court seat or ag in order to lay off hillary no golf and grandkids talk give us all a break the big questions in comey's badly reviewed book aren't answered like how come he gave up classified information jail why did he lie to congress jail why did the dnc refuse to give server to the fbi why didn't they take it why the phony memos mccabe's $700000  more unbelievably james comey states that polls where crooked hillary was leading were a factor in the handling stupidly of the clinton email probe in other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job slimeball so proud of our great military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the finest that our country has ever had there won't be anything or anyone even close a perfectly executed strike last night thank you to france and the united kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine military could not have had a better result mission accomplished doj just issued the mccabe report which is a total disaster he lied lied lied mccabe was totally controlled by comey mccabe is comey no collusion all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes we are bringing back our factories we are bringing back our jobs and we are bringing back those four beautiful words made in the usa  untruthful slime ball who was as time has proven a terrible director of the fbi his handling of the crooked hillary clinton case and the events surrounding it will go down as one of the worst botch jobs of history it was my great honor to fire james comey james comey is a proven leaker  liar virtually everyone in washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was in fact fired he leaked classified information for which he should be prosecuted he lied to congress under oath he is a weak and tremendous pressure is building like never before for the border wall and an end to crime cradling sanctuary cities started the wall in san diego where the people were pushing really hard to get it they will soon be protected would only join tpp if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to pres obama we already have bilateral deals with six of the eleven nations in tpp and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those  nations japan

is a truly good man and while he will not be seeking re-election he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question we are with you paul much of the bad blood with russia is caused by the fake  corrupt russia investigation headed up by the all democrat loyalists or people that worked for obama mueller is most conflicted of all except rosenstein who signed fisa  comey letter no collusion so they go crazy our relationship with russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the cold war there is no reason for this russia needs us to help with their economy something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together stop the arms race russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at syria get ready russia  because they will be coming nice and new and smart you shouldn't be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it doing things that nobody thought possible despite the never ending and corrupt

but is totally under siege do people really believe this stuff so much of the media is dishonest and corrupt china which is a great economic power is considered a developing nation within the world

the fake news washington post amazon's chief lobbyist has another of many phony headlines trump defiant as china adds trade penalties wrong should read trump defiant as us adds trade penalties will end barriers and massive  ip theft typically bad reporting the caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our border because of the trump administrations actions border crossings are at a still unacceptable 46 year low stop drugs still rising rasmussen poll shows donald trump approval ratings now

mexico  canada are very strong congress must change these obama era and other laws now the democrats stand in our way they want people to pour into our country uncheckedcrime we will be taking strong action today was just briefed on the shooting at youtube's hq in san bruno california our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved thank you to our phenomenal law enforcement officers and

these costs plus and not have them bourne by the american taxpayer many billions of dollars po leaders don't have a clue or do they thank you to rasmussen for the honest polling just hit 50percent which is higher than cheatin' obama at the same time in his administration check out the fact that you can't get a job at ratings challenged  unless you state that you are totally anti-trump little jeff zuker whose job is in jeopardy is not having much fun lately they should clean up and strengthen cnn and get back to honest reporting the big caravan of people from honduras now coming across mexico and heading to our weak laws border had better be stopped before it gets there cash cow nafta is in play as is foreign aid to honduras and the countries that allow this to happen congress must act now the fake news networks those that knowingly have a sick and biased agenda are worried about the competition and quality of sinclair broadcast the fakers at cnn nbc abc  cbs have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction    president trump's approval rate among likely us voters hit 50 percent on monday which puts him higher than former president barack obama's score at the same point into his first term according to a new poll via    39percent of my nominations including diplomats to foreign lands have not been confirmed due to democrat obstruction and delay at this rate it would take more than 7 years before i am allowed to have these great people start working never happened before disgraceful honduras mexico and many other countries that the us is very generous to sends many of their people to our country through our weak immigration policies caravans are heading here must pass tough laws and build the wall democrats allow open borders drugs and crime as ridiculous as it sounds the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our southern border back where they came from a whole big wasted procedure must take place mexico  canada have tough immigration laws whereas ours are an obama joke act congress president donald j trump proclaims april 2 2018 world autism awareness day  an honor to host the annual  easter egg roll  so sad that the department of justice and the fbi are slow walking or even not giving the unredacted documents requested by congress an embarrassment to our country only fools or worse are saying that our money losing post office makes money with amazon they lose a fortune and this will be changed also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the countrynot a level playing field so funny to watch fake news networks among the most dishonest groups of people i have ever dealt with criticize sinclair broadcasting for being biased sinclair is far superior to cnn and even more fake nbc which is a total joke mexico is making a fortune on naftathey have very strong border laws ours are pathetic with all of the money they make from the us hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until congress changes our immigration laws daca is dead because the democrats didn't care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the daca bandwagon no longer works must build wall and secure our borders with proper border legislation democrats want no borders hence drugs and crime congress must immediately pass border legislation use nuclear option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of drugs and people border patrol agents and ice are great but the weak dem laws don't allow them to do their job act now congress our country is being stolen mexico has the absolute power not to let these large caravans of people enter their country they must stop them at their northern border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws these big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of daca they want in on the act mexico is doing very little if not nothing at stopping people from flowing into mexico through their southern border and then into the us they laugh at our dumb immigration laws they must stop the big drug and people flows or i will stop their cash cow nafta need wall border patrol agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the border because of ridiculous liberal democrat laws like catch  release getting more dangerous caravans coming republicans must go to nuclear option to pass tough laws now no more daca deal happy easter governor jerry moonbeam brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include 1 kidnapping and robbery 2 badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize 3 dealing drugs is this really what the great people of california want  does not include the fake washington post which is used as a lobbyist and should so  register if the po increased its parcel rates amazon's shipping costs would rise by $26 billion this post office scam must stop amazon must pay real costs and taxes now while we are on the subject it is reported that the us post office will lose $150 on average for each package it delivers for amazon that amounts to billions of dollars the failing ny times reports that the size of the company's lobbying staff has ballooned and that washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair no more it's time to rebuild and we will do it with american workers american grit and american pride  jobs jobs jobs unemployment claims have fallen to a 45-year low together we are making the economy great again  we are going to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the great state of ohio a tremendous honor to be here today at a state-of-the-art training site where the skills of the american worker are forged and refined  i have stated my concerns with amazon long before the election unlike others they pay little or no taxes to state  local governments use our postal system as their delivery boy causing tremendous loss to the us and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business in the interim hon robert wilkie of dod will serve as acting secretary i am thankful for dr david shulkin's service to our country and to our great veterans i am pleased to announce that i intend to nominate highly respected admiral ronny l jackson md as the new secretary of veterans affairs great briefing this afternoon on the start of our southern border wall  release known dangerous criminals into communities across the state all citizens have the right to be protected by federal law and strong borders my administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in orange county defending their rights against california's illegal and unconstitutional sanctuary policies california's sanctuary laws  just announced an agreement in principle with south korea on korus a great deal for american and korean workers let's now focus on our important security relationship received message last night from xi jinping of china that his meeting with kim jong un went very well and that kim looks forward to his meeting with me in the meantime and unfortunately maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost for years and through many administrations everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the korean peninsula was not even a small possibility now there is a good chance that kim jong un will do what is right for his people and for humanity look forward to our meeting the second amendment will never be repealed as much as democrats would like to see this happen and despite the words yesterday of former supreme court justice stevens no way we need more republicans in 2018 and must always hold the supreme court i am very pleased to welcome the opioid memorial to the president's park in april i encourage all to visit and remember those who we have lost to this deadly epidemic we will keep fighting until we defeat the opioid crisis  trade talks going on with numerous countries that for many years have not treated the united states fairly in the end all will be happy great news   so much fake news never been more voluminous or more inaccurate but through it all our country is doing great the economy is looking really good it has been many years that we have seen these kind of numbers the underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better  just wrote a book which everyone is talking about he was a great help he is a veteran journalist who had a great influence in nh and beyond he calls it the most amazing political campaign of modern times the book is called what really happened enjoy   president donald j trump proclaims march 25 2018 as greek independence day a national day of celebration of greek and american democracy   happy national  to our heroes we love you  lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed if for no other reason than they can bill more which is unfair to our great country and i am very happy with my existing team besides there was no collusion with russia except by crooked hillary and the dems many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the russia casedon't believe the fake news narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on fame  fortune will never be turned down by a lawyer though some are conflicted problem is that a new much can be done with the $16 billion given to building and fixing the border wall it is just a down payment work will start immediately the rest of the money will come and remember daca the democrats abandoned you but we will not because of the $700  $716 billion dollars gotten to rebuild our military many jobs are created and our military is again rich building a great border wall with drugs poison and enemy combatants pouring into our country is all about national defense build wall through m france honors a great hero officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in isis related terror attack so much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical islamic terrorism even stronger measures needed especially at borders our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in france yesterday and we grieve the nation's loss we also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support we are with you  as a matter of national security i've signed the omnibus spending bill i say to congress i will never sign another bill like this again to prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again i'm calling on congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills  obama administration legalized bump stocks bad idea as i promised today the department of justice will issue the rule banning bump stocks with a mandated comment period we will ban all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns news conference at the white house concerning the omnibus spending bill  1:00 pm i am considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on the fact that the 800000 plus daca recipients have been totally abandoned by the democrats not even mentioned in bill and the border wall which is desperately needed for our national defense is not fully funded daca was abandoned by the democrats very unfair to them would have been tied to desperately needed wall house intelligence committee votes to release final report findings 1 no evidence provided of collusion between trump campaign  russia 2  the obama administrations post election response was insufficient 3 clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts i am pleased to announce that effective 4/9/18  will be my new national security advisor i am very thankful for the service of general hr mcmaster who has done an outstanding job  will always remain my friend there will be an official contact handover on 4/9 my honor charlie thank you   as a candidate i pledged that if elected i would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade protect american workers and defend our national security  today we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment   remember when they were saying during the campaign that donald trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as crooked hillary's large and highly sophisticated staff well not saying that anymore crazy joe biden is trying to act like a tough guy actually he is weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault he doesn't know me but he would go down fast and hard crying all the way don't threaten people joe democrats refused to take care of daca would have been so easy but they just didn't care i had to fight for military and start of wall got $16 billion to start wall on southern border rest will be forthcoming most importantly got $700 billion to rebuild our military $716 billion next yearmost ever had to waste money on dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment they can help solve problems with north korea syria ukraine isis iran and even the coming arms race bush tried to get along but didn't have the smarts obama and clinton tried but didn't have the energy or chemistry remember reset peace through strength i called president putin of russia to congratulate him on his election victory in past obama called him also the fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him they are wrong getting along with russia and others is a good thing not a bad thing special council is told to find crimes whether a crime exists or not i was opposed to the selection of mueller to be special council i am still opposed to it i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council appointed because there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime collusion or otherwise or obstruction of justice  so stated by harvard law professor alan dershowitz special council is told to find crimes wether crimes exist or not i was opposed the the selection of mueller to be special council i still am opposed to it i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council appointed because department of justice should have urged the supreme court to at least hear the drivers license case on illegal immigrants in arizona i agree with  should have sought review austin bombing suspect is dead great job by law enforcement and all concerned our nation was founded by farmers our independence was won by farmers and our continent was tamed by farmers our farmers always lead the way -- we are proud of them and we are delivering for them  the democrats do not want to help daca would be so easy to make a deal a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interest  on  now great 8:18 am why does the mueller team have 13 hardened democrats some big crooked hillary supporters and zero republicans another dem recently addeddoes anyone think this is fair and yet there is no collusion spent very little time with andrew mccabe but he never took notes when he was with me i don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date same with lying james comey can we call them fake memos wow watch comey lie under oath to senator g when asked have you ever been an anonymous sourceor known someone else to be an anonymous source he said strongly never no he lied as shown clearly on  the mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime it was based on fraudulent activities and a fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc and improperly used in fisa court for surveillance of my campaign witch hunt the fake news is beside themselves that mccabe was caught called out and fired how many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife's campaign by crooked h friend terry m who was also under investigation how many lies how many leaks comey knew it all and much more as the house intelligence committee has concluded there was no collusion between russia and the trump campaign as many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the fbi justice  state  happy   andrew mccabe fired a great day for the hard working men and women of the fbi a great day for democracy sanctimonious james comey was his boss and made mccabe look like a choirboy he knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the fbi us consumer confidence hits 14-year high  it would be great for the republican party of nevada and it's unity if good guy danny tarkanian would run for congress and dean heller who is doing a really good job could run for senate unopposed our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of the brave troops lost in the helicopter crash on the iraq-syria border yesterday their sacrifice in service to our

either direction federal judge in maryland has just ruled that president trump has the right to end daca president obama had 8 years to fix this problem and didn't i am waiting for the dems they are running for the hills lowest rated oscars in history problem is we don't have stars anymore except your president just kidding of course we will see what happens  we are getting it done jobs and security  total inaction on daca by dems where are you a deal can be made the new fake news narrative is that there is chaos in the white house wrong people will always come  go and i want strong dialogue before making a final decision i still have some people that i want to change always seeking perfection there is no chaos only great energy it's march 5th and the democrats are nowhere to be found on daca gave them 6 months they just don't care where are they we are ready to make a deal why did the obama administration start an investigation into the trump campaign with zero proof of wrongdoing long before the election in november wanted to discredit so crooked h would win unprecedented bigger than watergate plus obama did nothing about russian meddling to protect our country we must protect american steel  first treat our farmers much better highly restrictive mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the us they have not done what needs to be done millions of people addicted and dying we have large trade deficits with mexico and canada nafta which is under renegotiation right now has been a bad deal for usa massive relocation of companies  jobs tariffs on steel and aluminum will only come off if new  fair nafta agreement is signed also canada must we are on the losing side of almost all trade deals our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the us for many years our steel and aluminum industries are dead sorry it's time for a change make america great again the gridiron dinner last night was great fun i am accomplishing a lot in washington and have never had a better time doing something and especially since this is for the american people if the eu wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on us companies doing business there we will simply apply a tax on their cars which freely pour into the us they make it impossible for our cars and more to sell there big trade imbalance the united states has an $800 billion dollar yearly trade deficit because of our very stupid trade deals and policies our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years they laugh at what fools our leaders have been no more mainstream media in us is being mocked all over the world they've gone crazy  happy national anthem day  rest in peace billy graham  when a
