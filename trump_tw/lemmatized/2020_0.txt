nothing democrats were busy wasting time on the immigration hoax  anything else they could do to make the republican party look bad while i was busy calling early border  flight closings putting us way ahead in our battle with coronavirus dems called it very wrong so the coronavirus which started in china and spread to various countries throughout the world but very slowly in the us because president trump closed our border and ended flights very early is now being blamed by the do nothing democrats to be the fault of trump so nice  diagnosis positive  is infected with trump derangement syndrome i'm calling out cnn for irresponsibly politicizing what should be a unifying battle against a virus that doesn't choose sides    like i say they are fake news word is that mini mike bloomberg performed so poorly in the two debates that he is thinking about dropping out of the democrat primary the fact is he was not true to himself and the public was able to quickly figure him out not a good experience for mini mike congratulations and thank you to our great vice president  all of the many professionals doing such a fine job at cdc  all other agencies on the coronavirus situation only a very small number in us  china numbers look to be going down all countries working well together do nothing democrats were busy wasting their time on the impeachment hoax  anything they could do to make the republican party look bad while i was busy calling early boarder  flight closings putting us way ahead in our battle with the coronavirus dems called it very wrong anti-trump network  doing whatever it can to stoke a national coronavirus panic the far left network pretty much ignoring anyone who they interview who doesn't blame president trump   media refuses to discuss the great job our professionals are doing they spied on my campaign   r of texas-08 loves texas  our country he has been a great congressman  supporter of  strong on crime border military vets and your 2a he is the best tax cutter in dc kevin has my complete  total endorsement vote on march 3rd thank you nancy has allowed her district to go down more than any other in the usa hardly even recognizable  my two great friends proud of you both  eric i can live with that  piers i like you too  big rally in the great state of south carolina on friday see you there every poll you look at shows that black support for president trump is growing   big story big win except in the fake news which won't cover it  during a debate pocahontas was mean  undisciplined mostly aiming at crazy bernie and mini mike they don't know how to handle her but i know she is a chocker steyer was a disaster who along with mini are setting records in $'s per vote just give me an opponent crazy chaotic democrat debate last night fake news said biden did well even though he said half of our population was shot to death would be over for most mini mike was weak and unsteady but helped greatly by his many commercials which are not supposed to be allowed i will be having a news conference at the white house on this subject today at 6:00 pm cdc representatives and others will be there thank you low ratings fake news msdnc comcast   are doing everything possible to make the caronavirus look as bad as possible including panicking markets if possible likewise their incompetent do nothing democrat comrades are all talk no action usa in great shape  just landed india was great trip very successful heading to the white house meetings and calls scheduled today   and all doing a great job with respect to coronavirus briefing this afternoon us acted on the coronavirus very very quickly gordon chang   thank you  russia wants him to win  an absolute disgrace  52percent in the new rasmussen poll 95percent approval rating in the republican party thank you democrats talking point is that we are doing badly if the virus disappeared tomorrow they would say we did a really poor and even incompetent job not fair but it is what it is so far by the way we have not had one death let's keep it that way cdc and my administration are doing a great job of handling coronavirus including the very early closing of our borders to certain areas of the world it was opposed by the dems too soon but turned out to be the correct decision no matter how well we do however the that is because they cover your favorite president relatively well   msdnc are dying in the ratings  no surprise  true but we are getting it all done  a total miscarriage of justice  there has rarely been a juror so tainted as the forewoman in the roger stone case look at her background she never revealed her hatred of trump and stone she was totally biased as is the judge roger wasn't even working on my campaign miscarriage of justice sad to watch cryin' chuck schumer is complaining for publicity purposes only that i should be asking for more money than $25 billion to prepare for coronavirus if i asked for more he would say it is too much he didn't like my early travel closings i was right he is incompetent on all trump or trump related matters while elections have consequences i only ask for fairness especially when it comes to decisions made by the united states supreme court sotomayor accuses gop appointed justices  of being biased in favor of trump    this is a terrible thing to say trying to shame some into voting her way she never criticized justice ginsberg when she called me a faker both should recuse themselves it has been a scam right from the beginning with the illegally started mueller report fisa the leaking lying  more schiff should not have access to intelligence he is a corrupt pol amazing that they went to bernie sanders but not to president trump  us intelligence official overstated assessment of russian efforts to help trump   they supposedly told crazy bernie that russia was looking at him not me this is all a big scam between intel and the democrats they want bernie out  hate trump spelled  great new book just out taken for granted how conservatives can win back americans that liberalism failed by gianni caldwell a young winner he will be at the ronald reagan library simi valley california on thursday at 6 pm pt check it out totally correct  the coronavirus is very much under control in the usa we are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries cdc  world

donald trump mini mike bloomberg i agree the decision not to prosecute andy mccabe is utterly inexplicable     i don't think there's any chance whatsoever of senator sanders defeating president trump mini mike bloomberg mini there's even less chance especially after watching your debate performance last night of you winning the democrat nominationbut i hope you do john kerry and senator chris murphy grossly violated the logan act with respect to iran if a republican did what they did there would be very serious ramifications they say roger stone lied to congress   oh i see but so did comey and he also leaked classified information for which almost everyone other than crooked hillary clinton goes to jail for a long time and so did andy mccabe who also lied to the fbi fairness this makes mini mike look good compared to his performance last night worst debate performance in history  a really great moment  this is the real mini mike he admitted many times that he is a fan of donald trump he's a new york icon thank you mike   jennifer rubin the wacko conservative of the  must learn how to spell the name bloomberg before it is too late  he is gone  mini mike bloomberg's debate

the democrat nomination they are taking it away from bernie again mini mike major party nominations are not for sale good luck in the debate tomorrow night and remember no standing on boxes what mini

our border loves our military vets and is strong on the  chris has my complete endorsement for the special election on 4/28 the mayor's efforts to shield illegal aliens endangers the lives of the

in which you were so harshly negative about the president  the people who support him don't you think we wanted to know that before we put you on this jury' pretty obvious he should get a new trial i think almost any judge in the country would order a new trial i'm not so sure about judge jackson i don't know  andrew napolitano  judge jackson now has a request for a new trial based on the unambiguous  self outed bias of the foreperson of the jury whose also a lawyer by the way ‚Äòmadam foreperson you're a lawyer you have a duty an affirmative obligation to reveal to us when we selected you the the united states is open for business i have seen some of the regulations being circulated including those being contemplated by congress and they are ridiculous i want to make it easy to do business with the united states not difficult everyone in my administration is being so instructed with no excuses product and goods to china and other countries that's what trade is all about we don't want to make it impossible to do business with us that will only mean that orders will go to someplace else as an example i want china to buy our jet engines the best in the world the united states cannot  will not become such a difficult place to deal with in terms of foreign countries buying our product including for the always used national security excuse that our companies will be forced to leave in order to remain competitive we want to sell the united states is open for business i have seen some of the regulations being circulated including those being contemplated by

watch what happens to the super delegates in round two a rigged convention but maybe i still will witch hunt badly tainted and in my opinion should be thrown out even mueller's statement to congress that he did not see me to become the fbi director again has been proven false the whole deal was a total scam if i wasn't president i'd be suing everyone all over the place these were mueller prosecutors and the whole mueller investigation was illegally set up based on a phony and now fully discredited fake dossier lying and forging documents to the fisa court and many other things everything having to do with this fraudulent investigation is would order a new trial i'm not so sure about judge jackson i don't know  andrew napolitano  existence of these tweets in which you were

senate not vote for the iran war powers resolution we are doing very well with iran and this is not the time to show weakness americans overwhelmingly support our attack on terrorist soleimani  every democrat is running to raise taxes she pocahontas lied about her ethnicity that was her problem   so true dagen two months in jail for a swamp creature yet 9 years recommended for roger stone who was not even working for the trump campaign gee that sounds very fair rogue prosecutors maybe the swamp   congratulations to attorney general bill barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought evidence now clearly shows that the mueller scam was improperly brought  tainted even bob mueller lied to congress fake news  and msdnc have not surprisingly refused to talk about my record setting number of voters in new hampshire and in iowa that's why they are poorly rated fake news i will win both states in november the fake news media is looking hard for the big democrat story but there is nothing too fabulous wouldn't a big story be that i got more new hampshire primary votes than any incumbent president in either party in the history of that great state not an insignificant fact thank you brad  prosecutorial misconduct  bootedgeedge buttigieg is doing pretty well tonight giving crazy bernie a run for his money very interesting a very bad night for mini mike a lot of democrat dropouts tonight very low political iq  who are the four prosecutors mueller people who cut and ran after being exposed for recommending a ridiculous 9 year prison sentence to a man that got caught up in an investigation that was illegal the mueller scam and shouldn't ever even have started 13 angry democrats impeachment king steyer how did that work out spent 200 million dollars and got less than 1percent of the vote in iowa and only 3percent of the vote in new hampshire could it be that something is just plain missing not easy to do what i did is it elizabeth warren sometimes referred to as pocahontas is having a really bad night i think she is sending signals that she wants out calling for unity is her way of getting there going home and having a nice cold beer with her husband whatever happened to hillary campaign manager podesta's brother wasn't he caught forced to leave his firm with big bad things to happen why did nothing ever happen to him only to the other side and a swamp creature with pull was just sentenced to two months in jail for a similar thing that they want stone to serve 9 years for a phony mueller witch hunt disgrace caught  is this the judge that put paul manafort in solitary confinement something that not even mobster al capone had to endure how did she treat crooked hillary clinton just asking  all starting to unravel with the ridiculous 9 year sentence recommendation  when jerome powell started his testimony today the dow was up 125  heading higher as he spoke it drifted steadily downward as usual and is now at -15 germany  other countries get paid to borrow money we are more prime but fed rate is too high dollar tough on exports mini mike is a short ball very hitter tiny club

nothing happens to them cannot allow this miscarriage of justice  just returned to white house from dover very sad  nice conflict brown dropped out of presidential race fast polled at zero  disgraceful  should never happen to another president  tough guys for trump  thank you new hampshire   a lot of people feel defeatedtrump always wins it seems like nothing can stop him danny villazon

opponent it is all getting quite interesting pelosi will lose the house again my poll numbers great 95percent approval rating in the republican party a record 53percent overall plus add 9 points corrupt democrat politicians have brought me to highest polling numbers ever with the impeachment hoax thank you nancy will be in manchester new hampshire tonight for a big rally want to shake up the dems a little bit they have a really boring deal going on still waiting for the iowa results votes were fried big crowds in manchester make america great again and then keep america great drain the swamp this is the biggest political crime in american history by far simply put the party in power illegally spied on my campaign both before and after the election in order to change or nullify the results of the election it continued on with the impeachment hoax terrible fbi director christopher wray just admitted that the fisa warrants and survailence of my campaign were illegal so was the fake dossier therefore the whole scam investigation the mueller report and everything else for three years was a fixed hoax who pays the price so good to see that republicans will be winning the great state of alabama senate seat back now that lightweight senator  cast a partisan vote for the impeachment hoax thought his boss cryin' chuck would have forced him to vote against the hoax a do nothing stiff  is much better at giving you the answer after everything is finished and the final result is in than he is at telling you what is going to happen because in fact he doesn't have a clue  sabato got it all wrong last time never came close to understanding the trump voter actually it's simple make america great again and then keep america great  it's all turning and fast mvp heckler  they conservatives thought the merits of the impeachment case were weak and therefore his romney's judgement is questioned    they are really mad at senator joe munchkin in west virginia he couldn't understand the transcripts romney could but didn't want to romney hurt some very good republican senators and he was wrong about the impeachment hoax no clue  yes  this is so true  this will never get old  deface the nation will tell  that he must start up judiciary and not stop until the job is done clean up dc now last chance  i grew up in new york city and over many years got to watch how great nyc's finest are now because of weak leadership at governor  mayor stand away water thrown at them regulations and lack of support our wonderful nyc police are under assault stop this now the dems are crazed they will do anything honesty  truth don't matter to them they are badly wounded iowa vote count was a disaster for them  leading also in new hampshire and most states the fake news hates to report this but you will see on november 3rd  the feeling of many about   thank you to everyone for all of the great reviews i have gotten on my state of the union speech it was an immense honor for me to have presented it to you and the citizens of our very strong and wonderful country but just like the people of west virginia will no longer look at weak  pathetic joe manchin the same i got the pension bill approved manchin couldn't do it the wonderful people of utah will never look at grandstander mitt romney with anything but contempt  disgust can't say i mind the fact that the great people of west virginia are furious at their puppet democrat senator joe manchin they will never forget his phony vote on the impeachment hoax all he had to do is read the transcripts sadly which he wouldn't understand anyway law enforcement has been notified be careful tough guys who you play with  great lineup on  tonight with   and   all starts at 8:00 pm will be discussing and explaining the impeachment hoax a great coach and a fantastic guy his endorsement of me in indiana was a very big deal  pete rose played major league baseball for 24 seasons from 1963-1986 and had more hits 4256 than any other player by a wide margin he gambled but only on his own team winning and paid a decades long price get pete rose into the baseball hall of fame it's time total and complete endorsement for debbie lesko   love arizona  governor cuomo wanted to see me this weekend he just canceled very hard to work with new york so stupid all they do is sue me all the time  more fake news this was photoshopped obviously but the wind was strong and the hair looks good anything to demean  we will not be touching your social security or medicare in fiscal 2021 budget only the democrats will destroy them by destroying our country's greatest ever economy the worst weeks ever she could have had a much better week if crazy nancy who is the most overrated person in politics going to lose the house a second time didn't bring the phony  corrupt impeachment hoax dems can't do anything right just look at the iowa vote count  who called me tears flowing to thank me for rolling out the maximum red carpet for the funeral of her husband then voted against me on the partisan impeachmen hoax said everybody dems wants to get out of town this has been in my whole career one of the only way to stop the crazed radical left do nothing democrats is for the republican senate to run an offense here      so true although the dems hoaxes  witch hunts have driven up republican polls and mine mightily crazy nancy pelosi's impeachment hoax has lifted republican congressional polls she lost the house once before and my polls way up which was expected but it has had a great effect on republican senate races including north carolina kentucky colorado and arizona thanks thank you iowa for the record vote we just received in the primary the dems were 25percent down although their votes are all fried  was given a horrendous report by his superior the man he reported to who publicly stated that vindman had problems with judgement adhering to the chain of command and leaking information in other words out fake news   msdnc keep talking about lt col vindman as though i should think only how wonderful he was actually i don't know him never spoke to him or met him i don't believe but he was very insubordinate reported contents of my perfect calls incorrectly  not good  after years building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country from our inner cities to our rural communities the forgotten men and women of america are forgotten no longer   always continue every republican senator except romney many highly religious people all very smart voted against the impeachment hoax  was all in a great person i was told by many that manchin was just a puppet for schumer  pelosi that's all he is i was very surprised  disappointed that senator joe manchin of west virginia voted against me on the democrat's totally partisan impeachment hoax no president has done more for the great people of west virginia than me pensions and that will great to be in charlotte north carolina as we expand and grow this unprecedented economic momentum today we launched a brand new nationwide campaign to revitalize under-served cities and towns across america  it's called opportunity now  another win just in nervous nancy pelosi and the democrats in congress sued me thrown out this one unanimous in the dc circuit witch hunt jobs jobs jobs üá∫üá∏  iowa and new hampshire will not be moved from the primary schedule as long as i am president great tradition off to north carolina  the democrat party has given up on counting votes in iowa looks like it all got computer fried nobody knows who the real winner is maybe it's sleepy joe but it's not looking that way they lost millions  millions of dollars all for nothing but i won iowa big i think they should blame russia russia russia again if they can't count votes properly how are they going to run us healthcare  welcome back james  very true thank you ted  john i love texas  so do i  thank you

strong sharp and powerfully focused on leading the counterattack on the coronavirus he feels they are doing very well even building hospitals in a matter of only days nothing is easy but the senate acquitted president trump of both charges fabricated by congressional democrats led by speaker pelosi and adam schiff to carry out the most egregious and partisan attack against any president in our history a man they knew to be innocent   this president has done more for african americans in this country than any president since lincoln  welcome back to earth  and congratulations on breaking the

approaches  i'm confident we can get it done so true  had failed presidential candidate  devoted the same energy and anger to defeating a faltering barack obama as he sanctimoniously does to me he could have won the election read the transcripts  the votes were a resounding victory for mr trump true but the impeachment hoax was just a continuation of the radical left do nothing democrats

everything we have toward victory in 2020 only this way can we save the america we love  and drain the washington swamp once and for all  democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open

communication with china concerning the virus very few cases reported in usa but strongly on watch we have offered china and president xi any help that is necessary our experts are extraordinary schiff must release the ig report without changes or tampering which is said to be yet further exoneration of the impeachment hoax he refuses to give it does it link him to whistleblower why is he so adamant read the transcripts the democrat controlled house never even asked john bolton to testify it is up to them not up to the senate democrats said i never met and released the military aid to ukraine without any conditions or investigations and far ahead of schedule i also allowed ukraine to purchase javelin anti-tank missiles my administration has done far more than the previous administration transcripts of my calls with president zelensky are all the proof that is needed in addition to the fact that president zelensky  the foreign minister of ukraine said there was no pressure and no problems additionally i met with president zelensky at the united nations i never told john bolton that the aid to ukraine was tied to investigations into democrats including the bidens in fact he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination if john bolton said this it was only to sell a book with that being said the melania and i send our warmest condolences to vanessa and the wonderful bryant family may god be with you all kobe bryant despite being one of the truly great basketball players of all time was just getting started in life he loved his family so much and had such strong passion for the future the loss of his beautiful daughter gianna makes this moment even more devastating reports are that basketball great kobe bryant and three others have been killed in a helicopter crash in california that is terrible news nothing done wrong read the transcripts majority of people say the us senate already has enough information  95percent

his fraudulent statement to congress where he made up all of the words of my conversation with the ukrainian president fake news after having been exposed as a fraud and corrupt can anyone including sleepyeyes chuck todd of fake  continue to listen to his con again read the transcript michael goodwin new york post sunday great editorial in today's wall street journal and congress shall be king bottom line the president becomes a vassal of king congress this is another reason for the senate to repudiate this house impeachment as its own abuse of power a partisan hoax why didn't schiff release this  a very good question  this is what democrats have done they want to create the idea that there is all this smoke so people think there's fire they did this with russia collusion  there was no fire it makes zero sense what the democrats are accusing him of   it was amazing to watch three days of arguments dismantled in two hours   paul krugman is a lightweight thinker who doesn't have a clue caused huge economic damage to his follower's pocketbooks he and others should be fired by   rep jim jordan delivers knockout blow to schiff's reputation  shifty adam schiff is a corrupt politician and probably a very sick man he has not paid the price yet for what he has done to our country the impeachment hoax is a massive election interference the likes of which has never been seen

the question well isn't the president going to be stronger and harder to beat if he survives this the answer is yes but the congress has no choice it has a constitutional responsibility joe biden pres candidate even joe agrees with us  after having been treated unbelievably unfairly in the house and then having to endure hour after hour of lies fraud  deception by shifty schiff cryin' chuck schumer  their crew looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on saturday which is called death valley in tv a foreign power engaged in clandestine intelligence activities and yet they still asked for the renewal two more times and it gave the right for the government to rifle through the trump campaigns files  emails text messages so how bad  illegal is that  frances hakes former federal prosecutor this is really significant the fbi had debunked the steele dossier in january of 2017 and then even after they did that even after they knew from the cia  from their own sources they knew that carter page was not the agent of he's got to explain this how did hunter biden get a billion and a half dollars from china to invest when he'd been in business for 60 days   21 state attorney generals

poll in texas-13   close race in kansas  president trump shows us that electability is no match for electricity by   the democrats have now conceded that president trump has not committed a crime  the united states looks forward to welcoming prime minister   blue  white chairman  to the  next week reports about details and timing of our closely-held peace plan are purely speculative the democrats don't want a witness trade because shifty schiff the biden's the fake whistleblower his lawyer the second whistleblower who vanished after i released the transcripts the so-called informer  many other democrat disasters would be a big problem for them this is all about undermining the next election liz peek  during his hopeless presidential campaign they will remain silent the fact is when mini losses he will be spending very little of his money on these clowns because he will consider himself to be the biggest clown of them all and he will be right mini mike bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting democrat rivals he says that if he loses he really means when in the primaries he will spend money helping whoever the democrat nominee is by doing this he figures they won't hit him as hard the democrats  shifty schiff whose presentation to the senate was loaded with lies and misrepresentations are refusing to state that the obama administration withheld aid from many countries including ukraine pakistan philippines egypt honduras  mexico witch hunt no matter what you give to the radical left do nothing democrats it will never be enough the democrat house would not give us lawyers or not one witness but now demand that the republican senate produce the witnesses that the house never sought or even asked for they had their chance but pretended to rush most unfair  corrupt hearing in congressional history in an impeachment you can't use a work of fiction as the theory for the case filling in gaps with presumptions against the president it was a weak presentation self indulgent  he didn't deliver the goods robert charles   of the 2020 election becsuse it weaponizes a process that should only be initiated in exceedingly rare circumstances and should never be used for partisan purposes   the democrats are trying hard to damage republicans prior to the election attorney generals from 21 states are urging the senate to reject impeachment they say the articles have legal  factual problems and the democrats case sets a dangerous historical precedent even an unsuccessful effort to impeach the president undermines the integrity there is no evidence of a crime robert charles fmr asst secy of state the crimes were committed by the other side schiff doesn't have a case telling the truth so he's manufacturing things rush limbaugh  sorry if

presidential harassment presidential harassment thank you elise  pelosi doesn't want to hand over the articles of impeachment which were fraudulently produced by corrupt politicians like shifty schiff

saudi arabia we discussed trade military oil prices security and stability in the middle east great interview with  kevin mccarthy on  there was no urgency with the articles of impeachment because there was no case we love australia  amazing analysis  reporting  if however the city or state in question is willing to acknowledge responsibility and politely asks for help from the federal government we will very seriously consider getting involved in order to make those poorly run democrat cities great again the homeless situation in los angeles san francisco and many other democrat party run cities throughout the nation is a state and local problem not a federal problem iran will never have a nuclear weapon congress  the president should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan impeachment hoax when we have so many important matters pending 196 to zero was the republican house vote  we got 3 dems this was not what the founders had in mind the impeachment hoax just a continuation of the witch hunt which started even before i won the election must end quickly read the transcripts see the ukrainian president's strong statement no pressure get this done it is a con game by the dems to help with the election the reason they are not sending the articles of impeachment to the senate is that they are so weak and so pathetic    the great scam continues to be spending time on this political hoax at this moment in our history when i am so busy is sad these media posts will serve as notification to the united states congress that should iran strike any us person or target the united states will quickly  fully strike back  perhaps in a disproportionate manner such legal notice is not required but is given nevertheless the united states just spent two trillion dollars on military equipment we are the biggest and by far the best in the world if iran attacks an american base or any american we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their wayand without hesitation they attacked us  we hit back if they attack again which i would strongly advise them not to do we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before  targeted 52 iranian sites representing the 52 american hostages taken by iran many years ago some at a very high level  important to iran   the iranian culture and those targets and iran itself will be hit very fast and very hard the usa wants no more threats hundreds of iranian protesters he was already attacking our embassy and preparing for additional hits in other locations iran has been nothing but problems for many years let this serve as a warning that if iran strikes any americans or american assets we have iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain usa assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an american  badly wounded many others not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime including recently as hard as i work  as successful as our country has become with our economy our military  everything else it is ashame that the democrats make us spend so much time  money on this ridiculous impeachment lite hoax i should be able to devote all of my time to the real usa 95percent approval rating in the republican party thank you followed and then it was withdrawn the democrats argument for impeachment has not gotten stronger over the last few weeks as senator josh hawley just said he's going to enter a motion to dismiss the impeachment trial because it's never actually been brought to trial different places that he thought were wasteful and the career staff as they always do pushed back and made a million excuses as to why they could not possibly stop spending us taxpayer money there was a back  forth over the legal arguments  the wh decision was christopher bedford the federalist senior editor there is nothing new in these emails at all that's been discovered it's exactly what we knew before which is that the white house  political figures wanted to cut off aid trump wanted to question aid to a number of this is a great book a must read  and more control over iraq and the people of iraq are not happy with that it will never end well the united states has paid iraq billions of dollars a year for many years that is on top of all else we have done for them the people of iraq don't want to be dominated  controlled by iran but ultimately that is their choice over the last 15 years iran has gained more of protesters killed in iran itself while iran will never be able to properly admit it soleimani was both hated and feared within the country they are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe he should have been taken out many years ago general qassem soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of americans over an extended period of time and was plotting to kill many morebut got caught he was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people including the recent large number iran never won a war but never lost a negotiation followed and then it was withdrawn the democrats argument for impeachment has not gotten stronger over the last few weeks as senator josh hawley just said he's going to enter a motion to dismiss the impeachment trial because it's never actually been brought to trial different places that he thought were wasteful and the career staff as they always do pushed back and nade s million excuses as to why they could not possibly stop spending ustaxpayer money there was a back  forth over the legal arguments  the wh decision wasq christopher bedford the federalist senior editor there is nothing new in these emails at all that's been discovered it's exactly what we knew before which is that the white house  political figures wanted to cut off aid trump wanted to question aid to a number of had happened to a presidential candidate or president who was a democrat everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason and more and it would be considered the crime of the century far bigger and more sinister than watergate a lot of very good people were taken down by a small group of dirty filthy cops politicians government officials and an investigation that was illegally started  that spied on my campaign the witch hunt is sputtering badly but still going on ukraine hoax if this it's alienating independents this president is being persecuted over three years with one investigation after another and that really plays to his base     their partisan witch hunt is hurting our country do badly  only bringing more division than ever sohrab ahmari new york post the trump campaign raised $10 million in the two days following the impeachment scam vote it seems the democrats have shot themselves in the foot in one more way they set up a process they know is not going to lead to the presidents removal  they don't know how to do that  great

you brad it's my opinion as a lawyer that the articles of impeachment are defective on their face which means i would like to see a motion to dismiss and have this disbursed without the necessity of a trial i don't think there should be a trial i think it should be dismissed remember when pelosi was screaming that president trump is a danger to our nation and we must move quickly they didn't get one republican house vote and lost 3 dems they produced no case so now she doesn't want to go to the senate she's all lies most overrated person i know read the transcripts very good meeting on the

the end result would have been catastrophic a big thank you to them iran killed an american contractor wounding many we strongly responded and always will now iran is orchestrating an attack on the us embassy in iraq they will be held fully responsible in addition we expect iraq to use its forces to protect the embassy and so notified the democrats will do anything to avoid a trial in the senate in

shell tribe of chippewa indians my great honor to do so thank you indian country for being such an important part of the american story i recently signed 3 bills to support tribal sovereignty trump stock market rally is far outpacing past us presidents   with new trade deals and more the best is yet to come speaker pelosi and chuck schumer's drive to try and rig the trial against the president is misplaced there is no factual basis for the articles of impeachment that passed the house this president will be exonerated william mcginley   thank you kristy have a great year  academy award winning actor and great guy  is fantastic in the role of mickey donovan in the big television hit ray donovan from midnight cowboy to deliverance to the champ one of the best ever boxing movies  many

impeachment hoax pelosi's stall tactics expose the weakness of democrat's impeachment case   thank you ritchie  the movie will never be the same just kidding  i guess justin t doesn't much like my making him pay up on nato or trade  california leads the nation by far in both the number of homeless people and the percentage increase in the homeless population two terrible stats crazy nancy should focus on that in her very down district and helping her incompetent governor with the big homeless problem nancy pelosi is trying to usurp the constitutional role of the senate the longer this goes on the more petty partisan  political it all looks   just more of the same from the do nothing dems nancy should be helping the record number of homeless in her d nasdaq hits 9000 for first time ever  trump stock market rally is far outpacing past us presidents  russia syria and iran are killing or on their way to killing thousands of innocent civilians in idlib province don't do it turkey is working hard to stop this carnage despite all of the great success that our country has had over the last 3 years it makes it much more difficult to deal with foreign leaders and others when i am having to constantly defend myself against the do nothing democrats  their bogus impeachment scam bad for usa nancy pelosi has no leverage over the senate mitch mcconnell did not nose his way into the impeachment process in the house and she has no standing in the senate brad blakeman crazy nancy should clean up her filthy dirty district  help the homeless there a primary for n nancy pelosi's district in california has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the us when it come to the homeless  crime it has gotten so bad so fast she has lost total control and along with her equally incompetent governor gavin newsom it is a very sad sight brad blakeman i happen to believe as a lawyer that the charges are defective they don't meet the constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors so i would like to see a motion to dismiss at least 51 republican senators would agree with that-there should be no trial the radical left do nothing democrats said they wanted to rush everything through to the senate because president trump is a threat to national security they are vicious will say anything but now they don't want to go fast anymore they want to go very slowly liars look the house is supposed to do all of this work on witnesses and documents before they send the articles over to the senate not to call in new witnesses go through new documents that work is supposed to be done in the house    overwhelming but this scam impeachment was neither also very unfair with no due process proper representation or witnesses now pelosi is demanding everything the republicans weren't allowed to have in the house dems want to run majority republican senate hypocrites why should crazy nancy pelosi just because she has a slight majority in the house be allowed to impeach the president of the united states got zero republican votes there was no crime the call with ukraine was perfect with no pressure she said it must be bipartisan  overwhelming but this scam impeachment was neither also very unfair with no due process proper representation or witnesses now pelosi is demanding everything the republicans weren't allowed to have in the house dems want to run majority republican senate hypocrites  overwhelming but this scam impeachment was neither also very unfair with no due process proper representation or witnesses now pelosi is demanding everything the

impeach the president of the united states got zero republican votes there was no crime the call with ukraine was perfect with no pressure she said it must be bipartisan russia syria and iran are killing or on their way to killing thousands if inocent civilians in idlib province don't do it turkey is working hard to stop this carnage wow it's all a giant scam  thank you tammy you are doing a great job  governor gavin n has done a really bad job on taking care of the homeless population in california if he can't fix the problem the federal govt will get involved  2019 holiday retail sales were up 34percent from last year the biggest number in us history congratulations america merry christmas 187 new federal judges have been confirmed under the trump administration including two great new united states supreme court justices we are shattering every record read all about this in the long game a great new book by  mitch mcconnell amazing story the only reason we were able to get our great usmca trade deal approved was because the do nothing democrats wanted to show that they could approve  something productive in light of the fact that all they even think about is impeachment she knows nothing about the usmca deal the american public's tone deafness  it should be intolerable because the american people have had it with this    the radical left do nothing democrats have gone crazy they want to make it as hard as possible for me to properly run our country the trump administration trump policies have put our economy on a trajectory it has never been on before griff jenkins  stocks kick off christmas week at all-time record highs  mount some kind of public pressure to demand witnesses but mcconnell has the votes and he can run this trial anyway he wants to   everything we're seeing from speaker pelosi and senator schumer suggests that they're in real doubt about the evidence they've brought forth so far not being good enough  and are very very urgently seeking a way to find some more evidence the only way to make this work is to the real victims here are the american people and the constitution the constitution has been damaged by this ploy being used by nancy pelosi this is a very bad time for the united states constitution   what the democrats are doing is obstruction of the senate it's wrong constitutionally it's wrong morally and it's wrong politically      l agree and so does the public the dems are complicating matters again keeping mueller out of it was the focus keeping it crisp  simple was the key and now all of a sudden they are saying maybe we'll go back and visit the mueller probe which is absolutely unbelievable and shows they don't care about stock market closes at all-time high what a great time for the radical left do nothing democrats to impeach your favorite president especially since he has not done anything wrong nasdaq up 722percent since our great 2016 election victory dow up 558percent the best is yet to come i agree 100percent  wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that republicans in the senate should handle the impeachment hoax in the exact same manner as democrats in the house handled their recent partisan scam why would it be different for republicans than it was for the radical left democrats what right does crazy nancy have to hold up this senate trial none she has a bad case and would rather not have a negative decision this witch hunt must end now with a trial in the senate or let her default  lose no more time should be wasted on this impeachment scam nancy pelosi who has already lost the house  speakership once  is about to lose it again is doing everything she can to delay the zero republican vote articles of impeachment she is trying to take over the senate  cryin' chuck is trying

 thank you lou this is political malpractice this is a horrible judgement call on the part of the speaker you put your members in trump friendly districts in a very difficult spot it's only going to extend it out further this looks like the joke that it actually is ben domenech the reason the democrats don't want to submit the articles of impeachment to the senate is that they don't want corrupt politician adam shifty schiff to testify under oath nor do they want the whistleblower the missing second whistleblower the informer the bidens to testify i will be signing our 738 billion dollar defense spending bill today it will include 12 weeks  paid parental leave gives our troops a raise importantly creates the space force southern border wall funding repeals cadillac tax on health plans

patriot fighting back against people that must hate our country  this is what the dems are dealing with does anyone think this is good for the usa  i got impeached last night without one republican vote being cast with the do nothing dems on their continuation of the greatest witch hunt in american history now the do nothing party want to do nothing with the articles  not deliver them to the senate but it's senate's call presidential harassment the senate shall set the time and place of the trial if the do nothing democrats decide in their great wisdom not to show up they would lose by default 100percent republican vote that's what people are talking about the republicans are united like never before i got impeached last might without one republican vote being cast with the do nothing dems on their continuation of the greatest witch hunt in american history now the do nothing party want to do nothing with the articles  not deliver them to the senate but it's senate's call thank you   thank you michigan i am on my way see everybody soon   such atrocious lies by the radical left do nothing democrats this is an assault on america and an assault on the republican party won't convict and remove the president then the house should not be impeaching the president in the first place if this is the new standard every president from here on out is impeachable  andy mccarthy   so well stated thank you in the end here nothing happened we don't approach anything like the egregious conduct that should be necessary before a president should be removed from office i believe that a president can't be removed from office if there is no reasonable possibility that the senate the evidence has to be overwhelming and it is not it's not even close ken starr former independent counsel will go down in history as worst speaker already thrown out once  thank you  impeachment is a terrible idea for the country the more people learn about impeachment the less people want impeachment  this is all about convicting a president based on innuendo not on the facts even the ukrainian president said there was no pressure  thank you  thank you  sean p is a much stronger candidate  sean is a great patriot and will do a fantastic job has my total and complete endorsement  out and he's been amazing at it the democrsts have no message they have no hope for 2020    thank you doug had while the democrats are just looking out for elections this president should just continue to fight like he's always fought for himself  for this country continue to put forth policies like prescription drugs  trade policies that's what makes this president stand said i'm going to clean up washington i'm going to help people he gave big tax cuts he's made our military strong they're mad at him because he actually did what he said he was going to do history will record we're experiencing some of the best times we've ever it's sad here's a gentleman who came to the white house and all they had was never to let him have an easy breath all they wanted to do is impeach him they started the day after he was elected even the day after he was sworn in  but this president came to washington and they just wanted to get at the president they had no intention of having a proper investigation they couldn't find any crimes so they did a vague abuse of power and abuse of congress which every administration from the beginning has done   can you believe that i will be impeached today by the radical left do nothing democrats and i did nothing wrong a terrible thing read the transcripts this should never happen to another president again say a prayer   my hope is that impeachment will never become this trivial again   well said brian   voters say the democrats are trying to take away their votes pelosi was right the first time impeachment has backfired thoroughly on the democrats how can you impeach the president for going to the courts they want to impeach me i'm not worried and yet they were all breaking the law in so many ways how can they do that and yet impeach a very successful economy plus president of the united states who has done nothing wrong these people are crazy so if comey  the top people in the fbi were dirty cops and cheated on the fisa court wouldn't all of these phony cases have to be overturned or dismissed they went after me with the fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary  the dnc which they illegally presented to fisa good marks and reviews on the letter i sent to pelosi today she is the worst no wonder with people like her and cryin' chuck schumer dc has been such a mess for so long and that includes the previous administration who and now we know for sure spied on my campaign democrat leadership despite their denials are putting tremendous pressure on their members to vote yes on this ridiculous impeachment if they vote yes it will be much easier for republicans to win in 2020 wow in a stunning rebuke of the fbi the fisa court severly chastised the fbi for the fisa abuses brought to light in the recent inspector general's report there were at least 17 significant errors  statement by the court was long and tough means my case was a scam senator dan sullivan is doing a great job for the people of alaska while supporting our  agenda he fights hard everyday to support our veterans and the military dan is strong on the  and is 100percent pro-jobs i give dan sullivan my complete and total endorsement  is a businessman first he takes care of our vets and troops and is leading the fight to slash drug prices

peaceful democratic transition through free elections we denounce the ongoing violence and those that provoke it both in bolivia and from afar the us stands with the people of the region for peace and democracy chance they've had their kangaroo court they've had their circus for weeks and months there just isn't anything there and there's no way i'm voting for impeachment for somebody who hasn't committed any impeachable offenses  senator josh hawley r-mo they the dems don't have anything this whole thing is a joke and it's time to get the president exonerated the house has no evidence of any impeachable offense there's nothing there and they didn't even charge a crime they've had their would be sooo great if the fed would further lower interest rates and quantitative ease the dollar is very strong against other currencies and there is almost no inflation this is the time to do it exports would zoom the new usa today poll just out has me leading all of the democrat contenders that's hard to believe since the fake news  3 year scams and witch hunts as phony as they are just never seem to end the american people are smart they see the great economy  everything else impeachment poll

dangerous to simply let the american people pick the next president in 2020    looking like a big win for boris in the uk nancy pelosi just got duped in an interview to admitting that she has been working on impeaching me for two and a half years in other words she lied this was the radical left do nothing democrats plan all along long before the ukraine phone call impeachment hoax what's gone on the last three years is not reasonable the majority has been so abusive by congress by the justice department  fbi friends of the democrats who hated the president when he was nothing but a candidate at some point somebody should have said wait a minute this is out of control this train is off the tracks it's time to get reasonable   this is so surreal for three years this president has been harassed he's been electronically surveilled spied upon allegations have never ceased they continue and their continuing today at some point you would think you would look at the abuse i think it's obvious to all the american public that this is a railroad job   i also have constantly asked why aren't germany france and other european countries helping ukraine more they are the biggest beneficiaries why is it always the good ol' united states the radical left do nothing democrats never mention this at their phony hearing dems veronica escobar and jackson lee purposely misquoted my

victims  their families during this very difficult  tragic time we will continue to monitor the situation as we assist local  state officials on the ground read the transcripts us is a reference to usa not me shifty schiff a totally corrupt politician made up a horrible and fraudulent statement read it to congress and said those words came from me he got caught was very embarrassed yet nothing happened to him for committing this fraud he'll eventually have to answer for this witch hunt nadler just said that i pressured ukraine to interfere in our 2020 election ridiculous and he knows that is not true both the president  foreign minister of ukraine said many times that there was no pressure nadler and the dems know this but refuse to acknowledge looking like very good democrat support for usmca that would be great for our country america's great usmca trade bill is looking good it will be the best and most important trade deal ever made by the usa good for everybody farmers manufacturers energy unions tremendous support importantly we will finally end our country's worst trade deal nafta to impeach a president who has proven through results including producing perhaps the strongest economy in our country's history to have one of the most successful presidencies ever and most importantly who has done nothing wrong is sheer political madness  i can't remember anything quite like this the ig report   i don't know what report current director of the fbi christopher wray was reading but it sure wasn't the one given to me with that kind of attitude he will never be able to fix the fbi which is badly broken despite having some of the greatest men  women working there in a very long time the fbi has had some dark day in its past but nothing like this this was very serious misconduct on the part of the fbi    are you listening comey mccabe lovers lisa  peter the beautiful ohr family brennan clapper  many more you have to look at the 17 instances of misconduct cited in the report they are very bad the fisa court was clearly taken for a ride on this a failure of the fbi up and fown the chain of command it's about as strong a medicine as i've seen in a report of this kind a great choice bill is a winner  read the transcripts true  the do nothing democrats are a disgrace  the best economy ever  witch hunt  the real deal  witch hunt  let our great soldiers fight  america first  the democrats have thrown a wrecking ball at our democracy  no president in american history has been treated like this  cnn is a ratings disaster lost all credibility  what he did is illegal schiff is a corrupt politician and a criminal  this would be the first impeachment in american history without a specific criminal statute or crime that the president whose impeached would have allegedly committed paul gigot the wall street journal american people are supposed to believe that this simply isn't a part of everthing they've been trying to do for the last three years i think it is really a hard sell for nancy pelosi   the wall street journal the democrats haven't come up with a smocking gun nancy pelosi by raising this to the level of impeachment has raised the bar impossibly high this comes after three years of nonstop investigations of trump the russian collusion narrative the mueller report  now the ig report out tomorrow that will be the big story i think the democrats are going to lose many members over this   the wall is going up fast  i got nato countries to pay 530 billion dollars a year more and the us less and came home to a fake news media that mocked me didn't think that was possible great  don't get why  puts losers on like  who got zero as presidential candidate before quitting pramila jayapal david cicilline and others who are radical left haters the dems wouldn't let  get near their bad ratings debates yet fox panders pathetic it's going to go nowhere they are going to impeach not because they have the evidence but because they hate the president i think the american people know that this is a waste of time this is democrats putting on a circus  interviewed by sleepy eyes chuck todd any president has the authority to investigate corruption the president himself released the transcript of the call now the democrats have no evidence of a crime and no evidence of violating the law this is a kangaroo court in the house but it's going to go to the senate biden on the board of the largest natural gas company in ukraine getting paid $83000 a month 10 times as much as a board member of  thank you ted he also  made a fortune from china and others but zero before his father became vp    the democrats are now admitting that they can't prove a crime they can't prove a law was violated and here's why any president any administration is justified in investigating corruption and there was serious evidence of real corruption concerning hunter less than 48 hours before start of the impeachment hearing hoax on monday the no due process do nothing democrats are believe it or not changing the impeachment guidelines because the facts are not on their side when you can't win the game change the rules with the us presidential election in november north korea under the leadership of kim jong un has tremendous economic potential but it must denuclearize as promised nato china russia japan and the entire world is unified on this issue kim jong un is too smart and has far too much to lose everything actually if he acts in a hostile way he signed a strong denuclearization agreement with me in singapore he does not want to void his special relationship with the president of the united states or interfere  congratulations to  on tonight's huge win a great american patriot   schiff's surveillance obtaining phone logs is an unprecedented abuse of power  to put it mildly also it is illegal the united states secret service deputy assistant director anthony ornato will become my new deputy chief of staff for operations i have worked with tony for 3 years he will do a fantastic job thank you to dan walsh for his great service and congratulations to tony not only have the democrats not advanced key pieces of legislation that would help the economy but the polls especially in early states are showing that voters are tuning out  they don't want our greatest of all presidents impeached why re-elect democrats when you know that this is what they are doing with their majority their case is not strong because first it was russian collusion then it was obstruction then it was ukraine now their pivoting back to russia why would they be doing that lisa booth our economy is the envy of the world hard to believe but if nancy pelosi had put our great trade deal with mexico and canada usmca up for a vote long ago our economy would be even better if she doesn't move quickly it will collapse the united states will not rest until we bring every american wrongfully detained in iran and around the world back home to their loved ones  taken during the obama administration despite $150 billion gift returned during the trump administration thank you to iran on a very fair negotiation see we can make a deal together  while the world is not doing well economically our country is doing better perhaps than it has ever done before jobs jobs jobs read the transcripts also see where i say us our country as opposed to me meaning me and where i then say that the attorney general of the united states will call you people still remember schiff's made up and fraudulent version of my conversation witch hunt why is the world bank loaning money to china can this be possible china has plenty of money and if they don't they create it stop fake news  is

briefing on the tragic shooting at nas pensacola in florida and spoke to  my thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families during this difficult time we are continuing to monitor the situation as the investigation is ongoing without the horror show that is the radical left do nothing democrats the stock markets and economy would be even better if that is possible and the border would be closed to the evil of drugs gangs and all other problems   this seems personal that it is deeply unfair that has not changed this has become a matter of their unhinged emotional reaction to a man who has bettered them who has had victory where they have not had victory and has exposed the problem with the leftists this is a blowout look at these manufacturing numbers a blowout   this is the best number i've ever seen in my life great jobs report stock markets up record numbers for this year alone dow up 1865percent sp up 2436percent nasdaq composite up 2917percent it's the economy

fake news media makes up many sources say stories do not believe them where's the fake whistleblower where's whistleblower number 2 where's the phony informer who got it all wrong the story today that we are sending 12000 troops to saudi arabia is false or to put it more accurately fake news republican approval rating = 95percent thank you nancy pelosi just had a nervous fit she hates that we will soon have 182 great new judges and sooo much more stock market and employment records she says she prays for the president i don't believe her not even close help the homeless in your district nancy

good thing is that the republicans have never been more united we will win the do nothing radical left democrats have just announced that they are going to seek to impeach me over nothing they already gave up on the ridiculous mueller stuff so now they hang their hats on two totally appropriate perfect phone calls with the ukrainian president trial in the senate and so that our country can get back to business we will have schiff the bidens pelosi and many more testify and will reveal for the first time how corrupt our system really is i was elected to clean the swamp and that's what i am doing

if you are going to impeach me do it now fast so we can have a fair tremendous things achieved for us on my nato trip proudly for our country no president has ever achieved so much in so little time without a us increase other countries have already increased by $130 billion-with $400 billion soon such a thing has never been done before i would like to have the attorney general of the united states call you or your people this based on what i have seen is their big point and it is no point at a all except for a big win for me the democrats should apologize to the american people when i said in my phone call to the president of ukraine i would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and ukraine knows a lot about it with the word us i am referring

is not good for our farmers therefore effective immediately i will restore the tariffs on all steel  aluminum that is shipped into the us from those countries the federal it is clear that there is
