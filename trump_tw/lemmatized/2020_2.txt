will be interviewed by laura ingraham  tonight at 10:00 pm eastern on  enjoy just watched what biden had to say to me he's blaming the police far more than he's blaming the rioters anarchists agitators and looters which he could never blame or he would lose the radical left bernie supports law  order the radical left mayors   governors of cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their movement it wasn't supposed to be like this but the anarchists  agitators got carried away and don't listen anymore even forced slow joe out of basement i've been getting really good polls some over 50percent except for one fake poll done by  news which gives no information about the sample r or d or anything else they did this last election with one week to go down 12 points and i won they are disgusting fake news portland is a mess and it has been for many years if this joke of a mayor doesn't clean it up we will go in and do it for them if i didn't insist on having the national guard activate and go into kenosha wisconsin there would be no kenosha right now also there would have been great death and injury i want to thank law enforcement and the national guard i will see you on tuesday just had a wonderful conversation with my friend prime minister  of japan who will be leaving office soon shinzo will soon be recognized as the greatest prime minister in the history of japan whose relationship with the usa is the best it has ever been special man when is slow joe biden going to criticize the anarchists thugs  agitators in antifa when is he going to suggest bringing up the national guard in badly run  crime infested democrat cities  states remember he can't lose the crazy bernie super liberal vote his problem is interesting he must always be weak on crime because of the bernie sanders radical left voter if he loses them like crooked hillary did he is toast and many will vote for me because of trade bernie was good on trade joe must always be weak on crime joe biden is coming out of the basement earlier than his hoped for ten days because his people told him he has no choice his poll numbers are plunging going to pittsburgh where i have helped industry to a record last year  then back to his  basement for an extended period rushing him out of basement after seeing some very disturbing numbers don't worry he'll go back to basement soon  rest in peace jay  a weak and pathetic democrat mayor  the only way you will stop the violence in the high crime democrat run cities is through strength he tried mixing with the agitators and anarchists and they mocked him he would like to blame me and the federal government for going in but he hasn't seen anything yet we have only been there with a small group to defend our us courthouse because he couldn't do it ted wheeler the wacky radical left do nothing democrat mayor of portland who has watched great death and destruction of his city during his tenure thinks this lawless situation should go on forever wrong portland will never recover with a fool for a mayor the people of portland like all other cities   parts of our great country want law  order the radical left democrat mayors like the dummy running portland or the guy right now in his basement unwilling to lead or even speak out against crime will never be able to do it law  order  on  this morning  moving along nicely maga  michael knows  their minds are gone   should arrest these agitators and thugsclean up dc or the federal government will do it for you enough   the national guard is ready willing and able all the governor has to do is call  tone down the language but true  this is where his crazed leaders are taking their puppet  thank you lisa well stated  thank you we will not let them down  play football big ten  great patriots  disgraceful anarchists we are watching them closely but stupidly protected by the radical left dems  democrat leadership has no clue request help nowproblem over  antifa is a radical left group that only wants bad things for our country they are supported by $fools  wheeler is incompetent much like sleepy joe biden this is not what our great country wants they want safety  security and do not want to defund our police  our great national guard could solve these problems in less than 1 hour local authorities must ask before it is too late people of portland and other democrat run cities are disgusted with schumer pelosi and thier local leaders they want law  order  the big backlash going on in portland cannot be unexpected after 95 days of watching and incompetent mayor admit that he has no idea what he is doing the people of portland won't put up with no safety any longerthe mayor is a fool bring in the national guard  everything a governor asked the federal government for with respect to the pandemic they got they all said on tape the federal government did a great job governor cuomo used the word phenomenal the task force worked well with the states feds bailed out many states us planning to cut military presence in iraq  the thugs who accosted senator  and his wonderful wife kelly together with those who made threats to many other people who had just attended the republican national convention at the white house must be sought out and immediately arrested well documented evidence just returned to washington from louisiana  texas after tours and discussions concerning hurricane laura thank you to  and all god bless the families of those who perished probably shifty schiff but others also leak information to the fake news no matter what or who it is about including china these deranged lowlifes like the russia russia russia narrative plays better for them  doing a great job  watch mark levin now on  topic mail-in voting trump lands major endorsements from democrat mayors in minnesota   thank you so much i will never let you down now that biden's polls are dropping fast he has agreed to get out of his basement and start campaigninin ten days sadly that is a very slow reaction time for a president our beloved usa needs a much faster smarter and tougher response than that get out there today joe new hampshire and the big crowds was great last night thank you heading now for louisiana  texas to check out the damage done by hurricane laura    are together with law enforcement and first responders doing a great job even whether it's dumb warmongers like john bolton social pretenders like bob woodward who never has anything good to say or an unstable niece who was now rightfully shunned scorned and mocked her entire life and never even liked by her own very kind  caring grandfather about the only way a person is able to write a book on me is if they agree that it will contain as much bad stuff as possible much of which is lies it's like getting a job with cnn or msdnc and saying that president trump is great you have zero chance fake news i saved the iron range from the obama closure we opened it up again proudly also sent the national guard the minneapolis to squelch a big problem it worked and quickly  steve has my complete and total support he is great  texas loves john  esther is great  dan has my complete and total endorsement we need dan in washington  bill is great  another democrat run city they are a real mess  the fake news doesn't want to report these numbers the  and others believed the crooked dems before the real numbers came out too bad we don't have honest reporting when it comes to trump phony sources they say anything and think they get away with it november 3rd  great crowd great people  thank you  my campaign despite all of the fake news fake books and pathetic reporting written about me and it has more spirit and enthusiasm than ever before including the great and wonderful campaign of 2016 wow despite the democrats views across tv and online lie con we had 1479 million the republican national convention blew the democrat national convention  away not even close just like their lies on russia football play and everything else november 3rd the democrats see chaos as their way while president trump sees the rule of law mayor  thank you ken kenosha has been very quiet for the third night in a row or since the national guard has shown up that's the way it works it's all very simple portland with a very ungifted mayor should request help from the federal government if lives are endangered we're going in disgraceful that big ten is not playing football let them play how does the fake news not include online streaming numbers where republicans blow the dem numbers away great total numbers for the republican national convention blows democrat national convention away also much bigger fund raising numbers if the incompetent mayor of portland ted wheeler doesn't get control of his city and stop the anarchists agitators rioters and looters causing great danger to innocent people we will go in and take care of matters the way they should have been taken care of 100 days ago leading in michigan leading in minnesota leading all over sorry  thank you new hampshire   landing in new hampshire no i want big ten and all other football back now the dems don't want football back for political reasons but are trying to blame me and the republicans another lie but this is what we are up against they should also open up all of their shutdown states heading to new hampshire thank you   success since the national guard moved into kenosha wisconsin two days ago there has been no further violence not even a small problem when legally asked to help by local authorities the federal government will act and quickly succeed are you listening portland succes since the national guard moved into kenosha wisconsin two days ago there has been no further violence not even a small problem when legally asked to help by local authorities the federal government will act and quickly succeed are you listening portland great ratings  reviews last night thank you democrats hate that i called for big pharma to match the lowest prescription drug prices in the world by using a favored nations clause prices will plunge democrats and biden didn't even mention the anarchists agitators looters and so called peaceful protesters at their convention they will allow rampant crime just as they do in portland if they ask us as they must do we will end crime in their democrat run cities fast the ten most dangerous cities in the us are all run by democrats and this has gone on for decades today i will be sending federal law enforcement and the national guard to kenosha wi to restore law and order we will not stand for looting arson violence and lawlessness on american streets my team just got off the phone with governor evers who agreed to accept federal assistance portland should do the same hurricane laura is a very dangerous and rapidly intensifying hurricane my administration remains fully engaged with state  local emergency managers to continue preparing and assisting the great people texas louisiana and arkansas listen to local officials we are with you  just in chinese state media and leaders of china want biden to win the us election  if this happened which it won't china would own our country and our record setting stock markets would literally crash governor should call in the national guard in wisconsin it is ready willing and more than able end problem fast 80 million unsolicited ballots are impossible for election centers to tabulate accurately the democrats know this better than anyone else the fraud and abuse will be an embarrassment to our country hopefully the courts will stop this scam they must stop calling these anarchists and agitators peaceful protestors come back into the real world the federal government is ready to end this problem immediately upon your request we again request kate brown  the governor of oregon and mayor  of portland to call up the national guard like should have been done 3 months ago i am pleased to inform the american public that acting secretary chad wolf will be nominated to be the secretary of homeland security chad has done an outstanding job and we greatly appreciate his service more jobs from eastport cutler  jonesport to stonington friendship and casco bay i am proud to help the great people of maine beautiful maine lobsters will now move tariff-free to europe for first time in many years great new deal by ustr levels playing field with canada millions of $'s more in exports for our country to be sending 80 million unsolicited ballots is very unfair and a roadmap to disaster even recent small and easier to control elections which did this are a catastrophic disaster fraudulent  missing ballots like never seen before 20percent and 30percent off stop very appreciative that  covered the vast majority of the republican convention last night that was really good for cnn while at the same time being good for our country thank you thank you   thank you to  for this evenings opening prayer  promises made promises kept   joe biden has said he would lock down the country again that's crazy we're having record job growth and a booming stock market but joe would end it all and close it all down ridiculous exclusive eyewitness says as many as 20000 unverified absentee ballots counted in detroit primary  via  god bless the usa  all the radical left democrats are trying to do with the post office hearings is blame the republicans for the fraud that will occur because of the 51 million ballots that are being sent to people who have not even requested them they are setting the table for a big mess incredible that   msdnc aren't covering the roll call of states fake news this is what the republican party is up against also i'd like to hear the remarks of the delegates from individual states rather than  anchors ridiculous continued  please watch highly respected dr harvey risch of yale on hydroxychloroquine  the greatest election fraud in our history is about to happen this may top the democrats illegally spying on my campaign  watch mark levin on air now great  actually i think i'm leading in the polls    chris wallace forgot to ask a very weak and pathetic schumer puppet senator chrisie coons why biden fought me when i put an extremely early ban on people coming into our country from heavily infected china biden later admitted i was right but why no question next we'll turn to people of the biden inner circle said by chris wallace of  after unsuccessfully grilling mark meadows then all softball questions to a group of biden lightweights including senator chris coons of delaware important white house news conference at 5:30 sharp today very good news happy sunday we want god   two democrat caucus meetings removed under god from the pledge of allegiance it sounded not only strange but terrible that's where they're coming from these riots are an antigovernment movement from the left that are all in democrat run cities the mayors have got to let their police do what they know how to do would be very easy to suppress or call in the federal government we will solve problem fast  so now the democrats are using mail drop boxes which are a voter security disaster among other things they make it possible for a person to vote multiple times also who controls them are they placed in republican or democrat areas they are not covid sanitized a big fraud now they're trying to deny this but they can't   wrote a great new book the trump century how our president changed the course of history forever strongly recommendeda special guy  a favored nations clause against big pharma which i signed last week means that the usa gets a price on prescription drugs that matches the price of the country that pays the lowest price anywhere in the world 50percent 60percent maybe 70percent reduction no other president would do this will be interviewed by  on  9:00 pm sunday night enjoy despite biggest ever job gains and a v shaped recovery joe biden said i would shut it down referring to our country he has no clue terrible  we did criminal justice reform without many politically motivated democrats the black  hispanic community will remember this on november 3rd  that they are trying to pull off in violation of everything that our country stands for vote no to the pelosi/ schumer money wasting hoax which is taking place now then fight the $51 million unasked for ballots only absentee ballots are acceptable representatives of the post office have repeatedly stated that they do not need money and will not make changes this is all another hoax by the democrats to give 25 billion unneeded dollars for political purposes  without talking about the universal mail-in ballot scam in new jersey they want you to certify that you asked for the universal mail-in ballot that they sent you but you never asked for it disaster in the wings many doctors and studies disagree with this  the deep state or whoever over at the fda is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics obviously they are hoping to delay the answer until after november 3rd must focus on speed and saving lives  why would suburban women vote for biden and the democrats when democrat run cities are now rampant with crime and they aren't asking the federal government for help which could easily spread to the suburbs and they will reconstitute on steroids their low income suburbs plan biden and the democrats have greatly disrespected the great state of wisconsin by not even paying a small visit to milwaukee the designated site of the dnc the state  city worked very hard to make sure things would be good not nice vote trump wisconsin the democrats took the word god out of the pledge of allegiance at the democrat national convention at first i thought they made a mistake but it wasn't it was done on purpose remember evangelical christians and all this is where they are coming from-it's done vote nov 3 another bad night of rioting in portland oregon a small number of federal troops there to protect courthouse and other federal property only great job wanting to be asked by city  state to stop the riots would bring in national guard end problem immediately ask robert i love you rest in peace in 47 years joe did none of the things of which he now speaks he will never change just words 96percent approval rating in the republican party 51percent approval rating overall in the rasmussen poll thank you after the worst debate performance in the history of politics michael bloomberg commonly known as mini mike is trying to make a comeback by begging the democrats for relevance they treated him like a dog and always will before politics he said great things about me 96percent approval rating in the republican party 51percent approval rating overal in the rasmussen poll thank you will be interviewed by  tonight at 9:00 pm enjoy   to get into the democrat national convention you must have an id card with a pictureyet the democrats refuse to do this when it come to your very important vote gee i wonder why they are sending out 51000000 ballots to people who haven't even requested a ballot many of those people don't even exist they are trying to steal this election this should not be allowed the democrats are demanding mail-in ballots because the enthusiasm meter for slow joe biden is the lowest in recorded history and they are concerned that very few people will turn out to vote instead they will search  find people then harvest  return ballots not fair america first   i stand for law and order and i took action operation legend has led to the arrest of over 1000 criminals including 90 killers all while sleepy joe biden and the radical left excuses violence and crime in their democrat-run cities i want safety  security joe allows crime thank you pennsylvania   make america great again  thank you   thank you   thank you donna   thank you   thank you so much  they would own our country  it's never a real twitter trending it's twitter executive's choice only negative on republican voices especially mine sarah is correct mccain was a lousy candidate with lots of bad policy but the deadheads sabotaged his campaign from the inside and never gave him a chance to win hope they were happy with obiden who gave you me  my great honor  but didn't she call him a racist didn't she say he was incompetent why did he refuse to endorse slow joe until it was all over and even then was very late why did he try to get him not to run he spied on my campaign and got caught i live in new york even the most liberal friends that i have are thinking twice about voting democrat this time because they've seen what's happened to the city under  de blasio and the state under  they're getting eaten up by taxes  welcome barack and crooked hillary see you on the field of battle  will be having a press conference at 5:45 pm see you in 15 minutes will he having a press conference at 5:45 pm see you in 15 minutes why are republicans allowing the democrats to have ridiculous post office hearings on saturday  monday just before and during our convention let them hold them now during their convention or after our convention is over always playing right into their hands  don't buy goodyear tires they announced a ban on maga hats get better tires for far less this is what the radical left democrats do two can play the same game and we have to start playing it now with what i am doing in the fight with the drug companies drug prices will be coming down 50 60 and even 70 per cent the democrats are fighting hard to stop me with big ad buys plus likewise big pharma favored nations and rebates are bringing prices down now we will win if you can protest in person you can vote in person senate intelligence panel found absolutely no evidence of collusion there was no evidence that the trump campaign conspired with the russian government to influence 2016 affirming the findings of other investigations daily caller big win matt  she was a terrible ag was she the leaker  great going laura you have a great chance against a pelosi puppet  kimberly will work with the trump administration and we will bring baltimore back and fast don't blow it baltimore the democrats have destroyed your city  great win anna watched your race from beginning very impressed your next opponent charlie crist is a pelosi puppet who is bad on crime our military vets  2nd amendment you have my complete  total endorsement  tell the dems that we have more cases because we do far more testing than any other country  and others in that business should be charged by the us postal system much more per package and the post office would be immediately brought back to good health now vibrant with all jobs saved no pass on to customers get it done meanwhile i gave america energy independence in fact so much energy we could never use it all the bernie/biden/aoc green new deal plan would take california's failed policies to every american in california democrats have intentionally implemented rolling blackouts  forcing americans in the dark democrats are unable to keep up with energy demand the democrats have to start enforcing law and order in their cities and states new york city chicago and portland are a total disaster people forget how divided our country was under obamabiden the anger and hatred were unbelievable they shouldn't be lecturing to us i'm here as your president because of them a horrible governor crime is taking over nyc  state everyone is leaving he is after the nra they should move to texas or elsewhere and must get tough cuomo killed 11000 people in nursing homes alone crooked  incompetent  john kasich did a bad job in ohio ran for president and was easy to beat and now went to the other side desperate for relevance good job by chris c in exposing yet another loser  many thousands of people work for our government with that said a former disgruntled employee named miles taylor who i do not know never heard of him said he left  is on the open arms fake news circuit said to be a real stiff they will take anyone against us the obamabiden administration was the most corrupt in history including the fact that they got caught spying on my campaign the biggest political scandal in the history of our country it's called treason and more thanks for your very kind words michelle looking back into history the response by the obamabiden team to the h1n1 swine flu was considered a weak and pathetic one check out the polling it's really bad the big difference is that they got a free pass from the corrupt fake news media my administration and i built the greatest economy in history of any country turned it off saved millions of lives and now am building an even greater economy than it was before jobs are flowing nasdaq is already at a record high the rest to follow sit back  watch somebody please explain to  that donald j trump would not be here in the beautiful white house if it weren't for the job done by your husband barack obama biden was merely an afterthought a good reason for that very late   unenthusiastic endorsement thank you will never let you down  now ap estimates that the real cuomo number of people killed because of his total incompetence is 11000 not the 6000 that was originally thought cuomo just like his brother fredo has not got a very good memory  a proposal by pentagon officials to slash military healthcare by $22 billion dollars has been firmly and totally rejected by me we will do nothing to hurt our great military professionals  heroes as long as i am your president thank you she was fired because she was boring and never had what it took perhaps that has proven to be a mistake  why would  put on phony congresswoman  a total waste of airtime new record for nasdaq save the post office why is congress scheduled to meet on post office next monday during the republican convention rather than now while the dems are having their convention they are always playing games get tough republicans great division between the bernie sanders crowd and the other radical lefties our country would be destroyed just landed in mankato minnesota just approved and fast the full emergency declaration for the great state of iowa they got hit hard by record setting winds thank you to   and governor kim reynolds what's with  polls increasing me by 10 points in a short period of time maybe they want to take over from  getting ready to land in minneapolis our great national guard saved the city from further destruction should have been called up sooner by local government the us post office system has been failing for many decades we simply want to make the post office great again while at the same time saving billions of dollars a year for american taxpayers dems don't have a clue  some states use drop boxes for the collection of universal mail-in ballots so who is going to collect the ballots and what might be done to them prior to tabulation a rigged election so bad for our country only absentee ballots acceptable will be interviewed on  this morning at 8:00 am enjoy great going jim proud of you  law and order if  can't do it we will  thank you franklin  thank you james  if carefully done according to the guidelines there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to do that vote at polling place doctor anthony fauci  is not watchable during weekend afternoons it is worse than fake news  i strongly suggest turning your dial to  they do a really fair  balanced job voter scam  the honorable thing to do is drop the mail-in scam before it is too late absentee ballots like they have in florida are good  news conference at 5:30 pm enjoy if obama did this they would speak of nothing else biden could never do it  thank you  would be terrible for our country  more fake news  fake news  great work by the governors of az ia la and nm      who responded to my executive action and promptly submitted applications that we approved quickly to support americans out of work because of the chinavirus more states to come so true but we won't let that happen  wow  the democrats know the 2020 election will be a fraudulent mess will maybe never know who won  so terrible  very strange sleepy joe never takes questions also his reporters have zero drive why can't my reporters behave

republicans should start playing the democrats game  has no sources on the task force their sources are made up pure fiction jim acosta is a fake reporter nevada has zero infrastructure for mail-in

florida send in your ballots make america great again i will be interviewed on  at 7:30 am enjoy nasa was closed  dead until i got it going again now it is the most vibrant place of its kind on the

roger loves kansas and will represent it incredibly well he has my complete and total endorsement will be a big win on november 3rd this is not the opponent the democrats wanted  there is tremendous lawlessness in america's liberal cities would be so easy to stop but they have a clouded vision of what should be done they are indoctrinated with a philosophy which will never work a philosophy which would destroy america portland would be the norm great meeting today with the coronavirus task force in the oval office stay informed at   the wall street journal  trump wins in portland  something big has changed in portland ore after weeks of chaos and flames outside the city's federal courthouse the past few days have seen the violence subside dramatically what happened william mcgurn  i am

massive numbers of cheering people gathered along the roads and highways thousands and thousands even bigger by far than the crowds of 2016 saw no biden supporters and yet some in the fake news said it was an equal number sad record high nasdaq it would all come crashing down including your jobs stocks and 401k's if sleepy joe ever became president china and others would own us so crazy nancy pelosi said horrible things about dr deborah birx going after her because she was too positive on the very good job we are doing on combatting the china virus including vaccines  therapeutics in order to counter nancy deborah took the bait  hit us pathetic wow really bad tv ratings for morning joe   doing great leading all others by far  not a factor my visits last week to texas and frorida had

our country is doing very well open the schools fake news is the enemy of the people with the exception of new york  a few other locations we've done much better than most other countries in dealing

clubhouse governor made it impossible for republicans to win the state post office could never handle the traffic of mail-in votes without preparation using covid to steal the state see you in court  and ruined the federal government must again seek the death penalty in a do-over of that chapter of the original trial our country cannot let the appellate decision stand also it is ridiculous that this process is taking so long rarely has anybody deserved the death penalty more than the boston bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev the court agreed that this was one of the worst domestic terrorist attacks since the 9/11 atrocities yet the appellate court tossed out the death sentence so many lives lost astronauts complete first splashdown in 45 years very exciting great to have nasa astronauts return

a trump rally but rather a very successful gathering of the great sheriffs and law enforcement of florida who gave me their unequivocal endorsement no defund the police here best wishes  wrong we have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country 60000000 if we tested less there would be less cases how did italy france  spain do now europe sadly has flare ups most of our governors worked hard  smart we will come back strong  :  homeland security is not leaving portland until local police complete cleanup of anarchists and agitators obama worked harder for hillary clinton and the losing clinton campaign than she worked for herself now he's working with sleepy joe will be same result maga is energized like never before we have more cases because we do more testing it's lamestream media gold we beat obama 4 years ago he worked harder than crooked hillary and we'll do it again  i'm with you all the way thank you  i am thrilled to be back in my home state of floridaand honored to receive the endorsement of dozens of incredible florida sheriffs thank you   the democrats are holding back the $1200 to $3400 family of four checks that were ready to be sent out very disappointed in  for blocking the temporary extension of the $600 unemployment benefits the do nothing democrats are more interested in playing politics than in helping our deserving people drain the swamp on november 3rd pelosi  schumer blocked desperately needed unemployment payments which is so terrible especially since they fully understand that it was not the workers fault that they are unemployed it's the fault of china pelosi  schumer have no interest in making a deal that is good for our country and our people all they want is a trillion dollars and much more for their radical left governed states most of which are doing very badly it is called a bailout for many years of bad dem mgmt  an outstanding man and one of the best ambassadors ever japan is running an excellent

people love me on trade great job by jim jordan and also some very good statements by tony fauci big progress being made  our massive testing capability rather than being praised is used by the lamestream media and their partner the do nothing radical left democrats as a point of scorn this testing and what we have so quickly done is used as a fake news weapon sad somebody please tell congressman clyburn who doesn't have a clue that the chart he put up indicating more cases for the us than europe is because we do much more testing than any other country in the world if we had no testing or bad testing we would show very few cases great to spend time with mike singletary while going to texas he's one of the greatest football players ever  a strong man and a really good person great being with you mike  my administration has been focused on finding treatments for coronavirus if you've recovered from coronavirus donate your plasma today to help save lives together we will

miles completed by the end of august  we are going to win the 2020 election big  must know election results on the night of the election not days months or even years later glad i was able to get the very dishonest lamestream media to finally start talking about the risks to our democracy from dangerous universal mail-in-voting not absentee voting which i totally support the phone with his amazing wife gloria daughter melanie and son vincent to express my deepest condolences to the entire family  melania and i loved herman cain a great man herman rest in peace  my friend herman cain a powerful voice of freedom and all that is good passed away this morning herman had an incredible career and was adored by everyone that ever met him especially me he was a very special man an american patriot and great friend i just got off support patio pizza and its wonderful owner guy caligiuri in st james long island ny great pizza  drug prices will soon be lowered massively big pharma drug companies are advertising against me like crazy because lower prices mean less profit when you watch a fake ad just think lower drug prices kate brown governor of oregon isn't doing her job she must clear out and in some cases arrest the anarchists  agitators in portland if she can't do it the federal government will do it for her we will not be leaving until there is safety with universal mail-in voting not absentee voting which is good 2020 will be the most inaccurate  fraudulent election in history it will be a great embarrassment to the usa delay the election until people can properly securely and safely vote major china virus flare ups in many of the countries that the fake news was touting as doing so well some of these countries are now a disaster lamestream media doesn't want to report this also highly inaccurate numbers being reported by many other countries  mail-in voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster even testing areas are way off the dems talk of foreign influence in voting but they know that mail-in voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race even beyond that there's no accurate count germany pays russia billions of dollars a year for energy and we are supposed to protect germany from russia what's that all about also germany is very delinquent in their 2percent fee to nato we are therefore moving some troops out of germany check out this mail-in voting experiment by a local news station   new york mail-in voting is in a disastrous state of condition votes from many weeks ago are missing a total mess they have no idea what is going on rigged election i told you so same thing would happen but on massive scale with usa fake news refuses to report  reported incorrectly what the federal government is doing with respect to portland we are demanding that the governor  mayor do their job or we will do it for them to complicated to discuss in a tweet but bad reporting by fox possibly on purpose  great to be in texas do not stop the crime and violence from the anarchists and agitators immediately the federal government will go in and do the job that local law enforcement was supposed to do if the federal government and its brilliant law enforcement homeland didn't go into portland one week ago there would be no portland -- it would be burned and beaten to the ground if the mayor and governor just landed in the great state of texas  i was on air force one flying to the great state of texas where i just landed it is amazing in watching  how different they are from four years ago not even watchable they totally forgot who got them where they are with biden drug prices will quadruple after many years the game is finally up for big pharma and they're not happy about it please understand that when you see their negative ads the drug companies are spending millions of dollars in advertising against me only because i am lowering drug prices massively 50percent and more biden and obama said they would do this for eight years but never did your housing prices will go up based on the market and crime will go down i have rescinded the obama-biden affh rule enjoy i am happy to inform all of the people living their suburban lifestyle dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood if congress doesn't bring fairness to big tech which they should have done years ago i will do it myself with executive orders in washington it has been all talk and no action for years and the people of our country are sick and tired of it reno-stead airport has big bucks coming its way i'm designating over $48 million from  to reconstruct the airport's taxiway and ramp this along with 4 other airport grants to nevada will help in the economic recovery and growth of the state i am in  flying to the great state of texas it is amazing in watching  how different they are from four years ago not even watchable they totally forgot who got them where they are big bucks are on their way to  over $211 million designated to wilmington international from  to expand their terminal and make other major upgrades and safety enhancements this will help to create jobs and growth in the region i am designating $189 million from  to many airports in ohio including   and several others for improvements updates and safety great for the economy and

boost to the state's economy i am designating $1877m from  for 7 airports across pennsylvania  northeast philadelphia airport erie international airport and others around the state great news for a great state texarkana regional airport has a major grant coming its way from  i'm designating $36 million to reconstruct its terminal building in addition to 5 more airport grants around the state glad to help the people of arkansas law  order sleepy joe biden is just a trojan horse for the radical left agenda he will do whatever they want the plus self-help for people who hate self-help by the very smart and witty  is on sale now it is great canceling cancel culture make his book as successful as his tv show buy it now great going to a very talented group  vote these people out they are crazy    be able to produce what i have so when you see those nasty ads from big pharma remember the only reason they are going all out is the massive price reductions you are getting not good for them plus i was only president in 51 years that got a prescription d reduction big pharma is taking television ads trying to make the case that i am raising prescription drug prices on seniors the ad is a lie what i have done will lead to a 50percent reduction in prices at least  big pharma is not happy about it no other president would nadler calls antifa violence a myth   they are anarchists with miles of tape showing their illegal activity jerry blame it on russia russia russia would destroy our american cities and worse if sleepy joe biden the puppet of the left ever won markets would crash and cities would burn our country would suffer like never before we will beat the virus soon and go on to the golden age better than ever before the fake news media is trying to portray the portland and seattle protesters as wonderful sweet and innocent people just out for a little stroll actually they are sick and deranged anarchists  agitators who our great men  women of law enforcement easily control but who make america great again so disgusting to watch twitter's so-called trending where sooo many trends are about me and never a good one they look for anything they can find make it as bad as possible and blow it up trying to make it trend really ridiculous illegal and of course very unfair anarchists agitators or protestors who vandalize or damage our federal courthouse in portland or any federal buildings in any of our cities or states will be prosecuted under our recently re-enacted statues  monuments act minimum ten years in prison don't do it  homeland security or federal forces are little involved in seattle other than we have a large standby team in case of emergency the media is calling that one wrong also in portland we are protecting federal property including the courthouse which wouldn't last a day rigged election and everyone knows it  where is justice  wow  he is and people are not happy about it the washington post is a political front for amazon nobody treated ronald reagan worse  nice  we do more testing than any country in the world by far over 55 million tests fake news  says we should do more testing but even if we did 100 times more they would then say it is still not enough they are totally discredited just want sleepy joe to win in november  the protesters are actually anarchists who hate our country the line of innocent mothers were a scam that lamestream refuses to acknowledge just like they don't report the violence of these demonstrations  the 2020 election will be totally rigged if mail-in voting is allowed to take place  everyone knows it so much time is taken talking about foreign influence but the same people won't even discuss mail-in election corruption look at patterson nj 20percent of vote was corrupted because of my strong focus on the china virus including scheduled meetings on vaccines our economy and much else i won't be able to be in new york to throw out the opening pitch for the  on august 15th we will make it later in the season the lamestream media including  which has really checked out is refusing to show what is really going on in portland seattle and other places they want the american public to believe that these are just some wonderful protesters not radical left anarchists there is no way a place like pennsylvania can vote for the radical left and their puppet joe biden when they are against fracking steel production and just about everything else that pennsylvania stands for likewise texas and many other states so the washington post is running the reagan foundation and rino paul ryan is on the board of fox which has been terrible we will win anyway even with the phony  suppression polls which have been seriously wrong for 5 years  the trump campaign has more enthusiasm according to many than any campaign in the history of our great country even more than 2016 biden has none the silent majority will speak on november third fake suppression polls  fake news will not save the radical left crazy nancy pelosi said i made a mistake when i banned people from infected china from entering the us in january tens of thousands of lives were saved as she danced in the streets of chinatown sf in late february biden agreed with her but soon admitted that i was right brett loves wisconsin mississippi and minnesota a good golfer hits it long  this week you had joe biden call arizona a city nothing matters with him however because the opposition party lamestream media covers everything up especially the corruption the obama/biden administration is the most corrupt in history they even spied on my campaign thank you jon  my administration is closely monitoring hurricane douglas off hawaii  hurricane hanna which has now made landfall in texas we continue to coordinate closely with both states  listen to your emergency management officials    to protect your family  property  and to joy his wonderful wife who he loved so much my warmest condolences one of the greats in the history of television regis philbin has passed on to even greater airwaves at 88 he was a fantastic person and my friend he kept telling me to run for president holds the record for most live television and he did it well regis we love you  many democrats are leaving the party over calls to defund the police    great going brandon you really get it the democrats in the house are trying to undo my big win travel ban bill which successfully keeps very bad and dangerous people out of our great country passed along party lines hopefully will be dead in the senate the dems have gone stone cold left venezuela on steroids wow  to virtual pennies epi-pens went from their incredibly high jacked up prices to lower than their original give away bargains biggest price reductions in history by far nothing like this has ever for our citizens especially our seniors remember your favorite president yesterday i signed four measures that will massively reduce the prices of prescription drugs in many cases by more than 50percent nothing like this has ever been done before because big pharma with its vast power would not let it happen expensive insulin went from big dollars congratulations jim it was a great and beautiful event well deserved  wow win in 2020  so obama and his team of lowlifes spied on my campaign and got caught open and shut case more papers released today which are devastating to them will they ever pay the price the political crime of the century 96percent approval rating in the republican party thank you congratulations    i spoke to highly respected chairman senator  who has informed me that he will not be changing the names of our great military bases and forts places from which we won two world wars and more like me jim is not a believer in cancel culture great job by  in agreeing to build in texas what is expected to be the largest auto plant anywhere in the world he kept his word to me texas   are big winners made in the usa the great jim ryun will be honored this morning at the white house with the presentation of the presidential medal of freedom congratulations to jim and the entire ryun family 11:00 am    will be interviewed by  tonight at 9:00 pm on  enjoy welcome back baseball  white house press conference at 5:15 pm live the suburban housewives of america must read this article biden will destroy your neighborhood and your american dream i will preserve it and make it even better  obama who wouldn't even endorse biden until everyone else was out of the primaries and even then waited a long time is now making a commercial of support remember i wouldn't even be here if it weren't for them i wouldn't be president they did a terrible job the democrats have stated strongly that they won't approve a payroll tax cut too bad it would be great for workers the republicans therefore didn't want to ask for it dems as usual are hurting the working men and women of our country recently watched failed rino tom ridge former head of homeland security trying to justify his sudden love of the radical left mayor of portland who last night was booed  shouted out of existence by the agitators  anarchists love watching pathetic never trumpers squirm we did great things but it doesn't matter to the dems  john bolton is with the exception of hillary by far the worst offender of them all  great but did maga have anything to do with this great ratings success  liz cheney is only upset because i have been actively getting our great and beautiful country out of the ridiculous and costly endless wars i am also making our so-called allies pay tens of billions of dollars in delinquent military costs they must at least treat us fairly i am deeply saddened by the loss of my friend charles evers charles was a trail blazer in politics and a fearless leader alongside his brother medgar for civil rights  we must protect our national parks for our children and grandchildren i am calling on the house to pass the great american outdoors act today thanks  and  for all your work on this historic bill mail-in voting unless changed by the courts will lead to the most corrupt election in our nation's history  strong stock market numbers you want to see them dive vote for the radical left with their big tax hikes in my view general flynn should never have been prosecuted in the first place  judge andrew napolitano   you will never hear this on the fake news concerning the china virus but by comparison to most other countries who are suffering greatly we are doing very well and we have done things that few other countries could have done tremendous progress being made on vaccines and therapeutics looking forward to live sports but any time i witness a player kneeling during the national anthem a sign of great disrespect for our country and our flag the game is over for me thank you for the good reviews and comments on my interview with chris wallace of  we may have set a record for doing such an interview in the heat it was 100 degrees making things very interesting we are united in our effort to defeat the invisible china virus and many

violence on the streets of democrat run cities you  your children won't be safe in biden's america and neither will anyone else would be so great if the media would get the word out to the people in a fair and balanced way we will win anyway but they are a far more difficult adversary than their radical left do nothing democrat partner law  order this is why we have so many cases for the media to constantly refer to  the economy is coming back fast  congratulations to my friend president  of poland on his historic re-election looking forward to continuing our important work together across

contributors are a disaster and all over the place the radical left has scared fox into submission just like they have so many others sad but we will win never in history have police been treated so badly as they are in democrat run cities and these cities are a mess police must take a stronger stand with the radical left politicians that are treating them so badly and so disrespectfully

many cases compared to other countries that haven't done nearly as well as we have is that our testing is much bigger and better we have tested 40000000 people if we did 20000000 instead cases would be half etc not reported thank you    the silent majority is stronger than ever just watch congratulations to jeff  on a great primary run and big victory against a very tough opponent   economy and jobs are growing much faster than anyone except me expected job growth is biggest in history china virus mortality rate is among the lowest of any country shaping up for a good third quarter and a great next year nasdaq at new record high 401k's way up i disagree with  on their very tough  expensive guidelines for opening schools while they want them open they are asking schools to do very impractical things i will be meeting with them in germany denmark norway  sweden and many other countries schools are open with no problems the dems think it would be bad for them politically if us schools open before the november election but is important for the children  families may cut off funding if not open death rate from coronavirus is down tenfold we will miss great country rocker charlie daniels who passed away yesterday in hermitage tennessee my condolences to his wife hazel and their family charlie is in my thoughts and prayers i love his music  covid-19 china virus death rate plunges from peak in us a tenfold decrease in mortality the washington times   valerie richardson  we have the lowest mortality rate in the world the fake news should be reporting these most important of facts but they don't president trump champions american greatness in his mount rushmore speech   the highly respected henry ford health system just reported based on a large sampling that hydroxychloroquine cut the death rate in certain sick patients very significantly the dems disparaged it for political reasons me disgraceful act now    wall is moving fast in texas arizona new mexico and california great numbers at the southern border dems want people to just flow in they want very dangerous open borders  why does the lamestream fake news media refuse to say that china virus deaths are down 39percent and that we now have the lowest fatality mortality rate in the world they just can't stand that we are doing so well for our country why does the a lamestream fake news media refuse to say that china virus deaths are down 39percent and that we now have the lowest fatality mortality rate in the world they just can't stand that we are doing so well for our country corrupt joe biden and the democrats don't want to open schools in the fall for political reasons not for health reasons they think it will help them in november wrong the people get it the democrats would not have banned travel from heavily infected china especially so early therefore far more people would have died corrupt joe biden now admits this schools must open in the fall of 2541 patients hospitalized between march 10 and may 2 2020 across the system's six hospitals the study found 13percent of those treated with hydroxychloroquine alone died compared to 264percent not treated with hydroxychloroquine  treatment with hydroxychloroquine cut the death rate significantly in sick patients hospitalized with covid-19  and without heart-related side-effects according to a new study published by henry ford health system in a large-scale retrospective analysis breaking news the mortality rate for the china virus in the us is just about the lowest in the world also deaths in the us are way down a tenfold decrease since the pandemic height and our economy is coming back strong deaths from the china virus are down 39percent while our great testing program continues to lead the world by far why isn't the fake news reporting that deaths are way down it is only because they are indeed fake news they name teams out of strength not weakness but now the washington redskins  cleveland indians two fabled sports franchises look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct indians like elizabeth warren must be very angry right now nasdaq hits all time high this is no longer about peaceful protesting this is about angry violent criminal mobs taking over certain democrat run cities it is a lack of political leadership in that city chad wolf     new york city and chicago play the sanctuary city card where criminals are protected perhaps they will have to start changing their ways and thinking has  apologized to all of those great nascar drivers  officials who came to his aid stood by his side  were willing to sacrifice everything for him only to find out that the whole thing was just another hoax that  flag decision has caused lowest ratings ever china has caused great damage to the united states and the rest of the world if you want your 401k's  and stocks which are getting close to an all time high nasdaq is already there to disintegrate and disappear vote for the radical left do nothing democrats and corrupt joe biden massive tax hikes they will make you very poor fast statue of frederick douglass torn down in rochester  via  this shows that these anarchists have no bounds new china virus cases up because of massive testing deaths are down low and steady the fake news media should report this and also that new job numbers are setting records democrats want to defund  abolish police this despite poor crime numbers in cities that they run crazy chicago and new york city crime numbers are way up 67 people shot in chicago 13 killed shootings up significantly in nyc where people are demanding that    act now federal government ready willing and able to help if asked  weekend afternoons is the worst getting into  and msdnc territory watch    instead much better  gladly puts up the phony suppression polls as soon as they come out we are leading in the real polls because people are sick  tired of watching the democrat run cities in all cases falling apart also now 96percent approval rating in the republican party another 2016 wow  got caught cold manipulating the words and meaning of my 4th of

listings would lead to disaster  the fake news media is being laughed at all over the world  this would be the beginning of the end he has no clue but he wouldn't be calling the shots  and if the federal government wasn't getting ready to go in and we were all set it would still be a squatter's anarchist's mess  in a certain way our tremendous testing success gives the fake news media all they want cases in the meantime deaths and the all important mortality rate goes down you don't hear about that from the fake news and you never will anybody need any ventilators cases cases cases if we didn't test so much and so successfully we would have very few cases if you test 40000000 people you are going to have many cases that without the testing like other countries would not show up every night on the fake evening news change hearts not stones there is no end to historical purification great historian doug wead thank you my friend america loves india  great  the  is a very corrupt and

new york's finest who love new york  vividly remember the biden was asked questions at his so-called press conference yesterday where he read the answers from a teleprompter that means he was given the questions just like crooked hillary never have seen this before no corroborating evidence to back reports department of defense do people still not understand that this is all a made up fake news media hoax started to slander me  the republican party i was never briefed because any info that they may have had did not rise to that level wow record growth in 2nd quarter under corrupt joe biden and his massive tax and regulation increases markets and your 401k's will plunge expect a record 2021 my executive order to protect monuments statues etc is in full force and effect in excess of a 10 year prison term please do not put yourself in jeopardy many people now under arrest the russia bounty story is just another made up by fake news tale that is told only to damage me and the republican party the secret source probably does not even exist just like the story itself if the discredited  has a source reveal it just another hoax congratulations to  on completely dominating the just

by  where are you roger ailes  at the request of many great americans who live in the suburbs and others i am studying the affh housing regulation that is having a devastating impact on these once thriving suburban areas corrupt joe biden wants to make them much worse not fair to homeowners i may end this is a battle to save the heritage history and greatness of our country  as i watch the pandemic spread its ugly face all across the world including the tremendous damage it has done to the usa i become more and more angry at china people can see it and i can feel it today's scotus ruling is a historic win for families who want school choice now  is a civil rights issue and no parent should have to send their child to a failing school i will continue to fight for school choice and will always defend religious freedom the lone warrior chuck we will get lower drug prices done thanks  we are tracking down the two anarchists who threw paint on the magnificent george washington

a new  powerful military choice for vets 2a protection big regulationcuts life  much more can anyone believe that princeton just dropped the name of woodrow wilson from their highly respected policy center now the do nothing democrats want to take off the name john wayne from an airport incredible stupidity rt   intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible and therefore did not report it to me or  possibly another fabricated russia hoax maybe by the fake news  wanting to make republicans look bad  absentee ballots are fine a person has to go through a process to get and use them mail-in voting on the other hand will lead to the most corrupt election is usa history bad things happen with mail-ins just look at special election in patterson nj 19percent of ballots a fraud corrupt joe biden's team is running false ads almost everything in them is a knowing lie just the opposite of what they are saying  very much like their fake news partners the dems want to defund and abolish the police not good  the vast silent majority is alive and well we will win this election big nobody wants a low iq person in charge of our country and sleepy joe is definitely a low iq person the fake news @ nytimes must reveal its anonymous source bet they can't do it this person probably does not even exist  have a good time this morning at first baptist dallas church the wonderful pastor  will be joined by our great  mike pence since imposing a very powerful 10 year prison sentence on those that vandalize monuments statues etc with many people being arrested all over our country the vandalism has completely stopped thank you corrupt joe biden has confirmed that he would give unlimited healthcare to illegal immigrants this would break our system and bring millions of people to the usa  funny to see corrupt joe biden reading a statement on russia which was obviously written by his handlers russia ate his and obama's lunch during their time in office so badly that obama wanted them out of the then g-8 us was weak on everything but especially russia thank you to the great people of the villages the radical left do nothing democrats will fall in the fall corrupt joe is shot see you soon  nobody's been tougher on russia than the trump administration with corrupt joe biden  obama russia had a field day taking over important parts of ukraine where's hunter probably just another phony times hit job just like their failed russia hoax who is their source nobody briefed or told me  pence or chief of staff  about the so-called attacks on our troops in afghanistan by russians as reported through an anonymous source by the fake news  everybody is denying it  there have not been many attacks on us corrupt joe biden said yesterday that we have over 120 million people dead of coronavirus obamacare is a joke deductible is far too high and the overall cost is ridiculous my administration has gone out of its way to manage oc much better than previous but it is still no good i will always protect people with pre-existing conditions always alwaysalways now that the very expensive unpopular and unfair individual mandate provision has been terminated by us many states  the us are asking the supreme court that obamacare itself be terminated so that it can be replaced with a far better and much less expensive alternative we will win the election against corrupt joe biden nancy pelosi and schumer we will save the supreme court your 2nd amendment permanent damage from the ridiculous green new deal and you from massive tax hikes also our heritage history and law  order do not believe the fake news media oklahoma speech had the highest saturday television ratings in  history  dominated tv with my interview on thursday night more than

system and replace it this is treason sedition insurrection the obama/biden administration is the most corrupt in history  when are the thugs looters and anarchists moving out of the so-called autonomous zone in seattle get going the number of chinavirus cases goes up because of great testing while the number of deaths mortality rate goes way down the fake news doesn't like telling you that failed presidential candidate thank you president trump carly fiorina said she will be voting for corrupt joe biden she lost so badly to me twice in one campaign that she should be voting for joe no complaints the fake news and phony fake suppression polls have never been worse the lamestream media has gone crazy a  commentator just ripped me with lies with nobody defending they talked about the friendly protesters they set the church on fire the day before they were anything but friendly and how i stood and held the bible upside down it wasn't upside down  how trump is making black america great again the untold story of black advancement in the era of trump by horace cooper  a great new book it was my great honor to free up 5000 square miles of ocean off the coast of maine enjoy the good and the bad it is important for us to understand and remember even in turbulent and difficult times and learn from them knowledge comes from the most unusual of places very sad to see states allowing roving gangs of wise guys anarchists  looters many of them having no idea what they are doing indiscriminately ripping down our statues and monuments to the past some are great works of art but all represent our history  heritage both pres obama destroyed the lobster and fishing industry in maine now it's back bigger and better than anyone ever thought possible enjoy your lobstering and fishing make lots of money biden failed with china they took us to the cleaners i got $billions out of china and gave much of it to our targeted farmers law  order is james comey and his band of dirty cops going to apologize to general michael flynn and many others for what they have done to ruin his life what about robert mueller and his angry democrat cronies are they going to say so sorry and what about obama  biden great  appeals court upholds justice departments request to drop criminal case against general michael flynn a great day in arizona  it is ashame that congress doesn't do something about the lowlifes that burn the american flag it should be stopped and now tomorrow  and the senate republicans have a great bill the  up for a vote will be great for both people of color and police in fact has major police support rebuilding trust and keeping communities safe hope to sign it into law asap big victory for patients  federal court upholds hospital price transparency patients deserve to know the price of care before they enter the hospital because of my action they will this may very well be bigger than healthcare itself congratulations america cases up only because of our big number testing mortality rate way down  we broke them up last night fast numerous are and will be in prison  hogan gidley will be leaving the white house on july 1 and heading over to my campaign to be the national press secretary  he is a strong loyal and trusted member of the team that i know will do an outstanding job we must win this election follow him at  dr anthony fauci who is with us in all ways a very high 72percent approval rating so if he is in charge along with vp etc and with us doing all of these really good things why doesn't the lamestream media treat us as they should answer because they are fake news we did a great job on coronavirus including the very early ban on china ventilator production and testing which is by far the most and best in the world we saved millions of us lives yet the fake news refuses to acknowledge this in a positive way but they do give there will never be an autonomous zone in washington dc as long as i'm your president if they try they will be met with serious force cases are going up in the us because we are testing far more than any other country and ever expanding with smaller testing we would show fewer cases this action is taken effective immediately but may also be used retroactively for destruction or vandalism already caused there will be no exceptions i have authorized the federal government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument statue or other such federal property in the us with up to 10 years in prison per the veteran's memorial preservation act or such other laws that may be pertinent washed up creepster john bolton is a lowlife who should be in jail money seized for disseminating for profit highly classified information remember what they did to the young submarine sailor but did nothing to crooked hillary i ended up pardoning him it wasn't fair see bolton broke the law classified information  interesting guy bolton is really dumb  true and he broke the law  numerous people arrested in dc for the disgraceful vandalism in lafayette park of the magnificent statue of andrew jackson in addition to the exterior defacing of st john's church across the street 10 years in prison under the veteran's memorial preservation act beware looks what's going on here where are the protesters was this man arrested  so terrible  the china trade deal is fully intact hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the agreement i brought back cars  jobs will do it again for michigan  everywhere else  a really wonderful book buy it and enjoy  wow the trump rally gives  the largest saturday night audience in its hustory isn't it amazing that virtually nobody in the lamestream media is reporting this rather major feat rather hard to believe that  didn't know that the border wall is well under construction fully financed  already over 200 miles long will soon be finished they just reported that it is something that dems are unlikely to budge on in this election year   could somebody please explain to reporter doug mckelway of  that the border wall has long been under construction the battle war is won the dems have finally given in in fact i will be in arizona tomorrow to celebrate the 212th plus mile of completion  presidential harassment trump rally gives fox news largest saturday night audience in its history  senator jim inhofe

millions of mail-in ballots being sent out who knows where they are going and to whom unlike the radical left i will always stand against socialism and with the people of venezuela my admin has always stood on the side of freedom and liberty and against the oppressive maduro regime i would only meet with maduro to discuss one thing a peaceful exit from power because of mail-in ballots 2020 will be the most rigged election in our nations history unless this stupidity is ended we voted during world war one  world war two with no problem but now they are using covid in order to cheat by using mail-ins i gave john bolton who was incapable of being senate confirmed because he was considered a wacko and was not liked a chance i always like hearing differing points of view he turned out to be grossly incompetent and a liar   see judge's opinion classified information rigged 2020 election millions of mail-in ballots will be printed by foreign countries and others it will be the scandal of our times barr mail-in ballots ‘absolutely opens the floodgates to fraud‘  via  this will be the election disaster of our time mail-in ballots will lead to a rigged election our coronavirus testing is so much greater 25 million tests and so much more advanced that it makes us look like we have more cases especially proportionally than other countries my message on that is very clear ridiculous don't do it  actually that would be a big improvement and she would win  his president trump's policies set a foundation that allowed us to survive the pandemic     true we built something so strong that we are now setting economic growth records again jobs  growth a democrat win in 2020 would be a tragic setback for african americans   the democrat house wants to pass a bill this week that will destroy our police republican congressmen  congresswomen will hopefully fight hard to defeat it we must protect and cherish our police they keep us safe republicans are the party of liberty equality and justice for all we are the party of abraham lincoln and the party of law and order  joe biden's record can be summed up as 4 decades of betrayal calamity and failure  he never did anything  the silent majority is stronger than ever before   bolton broke the law and has been called out and rebuked for so doing with a really big price to pay he likes dropping bombs on people and killing them now he will have bombs dropped on him big court win against bolton obviously with the book already given out and leaked to many people and the media nothing the highly respected judge could have done about stopping itbut strong  powerful statements  rulings on money  on breaking classification were made who was all washed up until i brought him back and gave him a chance broke the law by releasing classified information in massive amounts he must pay a very big price for this as others have before him this should never to happen again wow i finally agree with failed political consultant steve schmidt who called wacko john bolton a despicable man who failed in his duty to protect america also stated that he should never be allowed to serve in government again so true plain and simple john

thing the anarchists did upon taking over seattle was build a wall see i was ahead of our times extraordinary rescue yesterday by our brave and semper paratus us coast guard our rapid response and the vessel's survival equipment allowed these four mariners to see their loved ones again well done   based on decisions being rendered now this list is more important than ever before second amendment right to life religous liberty etc  vote 2020 i will be releasing a new list of conservative supreme court justice nominees which may include some or many of those already on the list by september 1 2020 if given the opportunity i will only choose from this list as in the past a conservative supreme court justice as president of the united states i am asking for a legal solution on daca not a political one consistent with the rule of law the supreme court is not willing to give us one so now we have to start this process all over again the daca decision while a highly political one and seemingly not based on the law gives the president of the united states far more power than ever anticipated nevertheless i will only act in the best interests of the united states of america religious liberty among many other things are over and gone the recent supreme court decisions not only on daca sanctuary cities census and others tell you only one thing we need new justices of the supreme court if the radical left democrats assume power your second amendment right to life secure borders and do you get the impression that the supreme court doesn't like me these horrible  politically charged decisions coming out of the supreme court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves republicans or conservatives we need more justices or we will lose our 2nd amendment  everything else vote trump 2020 he didn't want bolton anywhere near him bolton's dumbest of all statements set us back very badly with north korea even now i asked him what the hell were you thinking he had no answer and just apologized that was early on i should have fired him right then  there when wacko john bolton went on deface the nation and so stupidly said that he looked at the libyan model for north korea all hell broke out kim jong un who we were getting along with very well went ballistic just like his missiles and rightfully so bolton's book which is getting terrible reviews is a compilation of lies and made up stories all intended to make me look bad many of the ridiculous statements he attributes to me were never made pure fiction just trying to get even for firing him like the sick puppy he is it's a terrible situation and i blame the leaders of those cities the president of the united states has fought through a lot of different things since he's been in office and to be honest with you he's done one hell of a job    seattle's chop is just the latest example of liberal democrat cities caving to lawlessness    is facing considerable

surprises in growth data and policy action chetan ahya chief economist at morgan stanley law  order our testing is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country we have done a great job on this that it shows more cases without testing or weak testing we would be showing almost no cases testing is a double edged sword makes us look bad but good to have the far left fake news media which

deals endless wars you name it he has shown a complete lack of leadership he's weak  shot many democrats want to defund and abolish police departments how crazy the silent majority is stronger than ever interesting how antifa and other far left militant groups can take over a city without barely a wimpier from soft do nothing democrat leadership  yet these same weak leaders become radical when it comes to shutting down a state or city and its hard working tax paying citizens does anyone notice how little the radical left takeover of seattle is being discussed in the fake news media that is very much on purpose because they know how badly this weakness  ineptitude play politically the mayor  governor should be ashamed of themselves easily fixed thank you philip  michael moore i‘m

complaint  got caught big time with his hand in the cookie jar should be the end of his colorado senate bid makes no difference we already have a great senator what a fantastic group  great   is grossly incompetent and in no way qualified to be running an important city like washington dc if the great men and women of the national guard didn't step forward she would have looked no better than her counterpart mayor in minneapolis we should be standing up straight and tall ideally with a salute or a hand on heart there are other things you can protest but not our great american flag no kneeling i am a big fan of drew brees i think he's truly one of the greatest quarterbacks but he should not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent american flag old glory is to be revered cherished and flown high over the last number of nights if she doesn't treat these men and women well then we'll bring in a different group of men and women the incompetent mayor of washington dc  who's budget is totally out of control and is constantly coming back to us for handouts is now fighting with the national guard who saved her from great embarrassment i just signed the

or bad i don't care i'm endorsing if you have a pulse i'm with you few people know where they'll be in two years from now but i do in the great state of alaska which i love campaigning against senator lisa murkowski she voted against healthcare justice kavanaugh and much else police groups break with biden  his handlers want him to defund the police i want more money for law enforcement great to be with our wonderful men and women of the  what a job they are doing  the problem with asking for someone to give you a letter of resignation which you do as a courtesy to help them save face is that it is then harder to say you fired them i did fire james mattis he was no good for obama who fired him also and was no good for me in my inner-circle was totally exhausted by the job and in the end just slinked away into obscurity they all want to come back for a piece of the limelight john kelly didn't know i was going to fire james mattis nor did he have any knowledge of my asking for a letter of resignation why would i tell him he was not the problem is not the very talented low-flying helicopter pilots wanting to save our city the problem is the arsonists looters criminals and anarchists wanting to destroy it and our country michael is tough smart and loves our country this has been a big battle in congress for 25 years thank you to our great republican senate  congratulations to michael pack nobody has any idea what a big victory this is for america why because he is going to be running the voice of america  and everything associated with it i thought this letter from

century they spied on the trump campaign and got caught  i feel more and more confident that our economy is in the early stages of coming back very strong not everyone agrees with me but i have little doubt watch for september october november next year will be one of the best ever and look at the stock market now his primary strength was not military but rather personal public relations i gave him a new life things to do and battles to win but he seldom brought home the bacon i didn't like his leadership style or much else about him and many others agree glad he is gone probably the only thing barack obama  i have in common is that we both had the honor of firing jim mattis the world's most overrated general i asked for his letter of resignation  felt great about it his nickname was chaos which i didn't like  changed to mad dog his primary strength was not military but rather personal public relations i gave him a new life things to do and battles to win but he seldom brought home the bacon i didn't like his leadership style or much else about him and many others agree glad he is gone probably the only thing barack obama and i have in common is that we both had the honor of firing jim mattis the world's most overrated general i asked for his letter of resignation  felt great about his nickname was chaos which i didn't like  changed it to mad dog there has never been a president in the white house who has been more supportive of hbcus and their mission than president trump  the possible exception of another republican president the late great abraham lincolnand it's not even close the democrats know this and so does the fake news but they refuse to write or say it because they are inherently corrupt see pinned above in 3 1/2 years i've done much more for our black population than joe biden has done in 43 years actually he set them back big time with his crime bill which he doesn't even remember i've done more for black americans in fact than any president in us
