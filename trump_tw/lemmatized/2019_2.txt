clearly the right thing to do you don't want an fbi director with jim comey's ethics jason riley wall street journal enjoy the low gas prices over the labor day weekend my energy policies have made america energy independent while keeping prices low just like a tax cut the democrats green policies will raise your price of gas  but now we are moving forward like never before we are winning again and we are respected again being scolded by failed former intelligence officials like james clapper on my condolences to iran on their failed rocket launch sadly for the united states guys like him comey and the even dumber john brennan don't have a clue they really set our country back just watched congresswoman debbie dingell and many other democrats wanting to give up on our very successful trade battle with china which has had its worst economic year in memory and getting worse we are taking in $billions will be big for farmers and all has anyone noticed that the top shows on  and cable ratings are those that are fair or great to your favorite president me congratulations to  for being the number one show on cable television dan will be great  looking like our great south carolina

seen in decades be safe make america great again which is happening and then keep america great i was right about comey crooked cop a great team working hard  rt  the great state of north carolina has early voting for a very important congressional ninth race please vote early yes i am currently suing various people for violating their confidentiality agreements disgusting and foul mouthed omarosa is one i gave her every break despite the fact that she was despised by everyone and she went for some cheap money from a book numerous others also while madeleine westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement she is a very good person and i don't think there would ever be reason to use it she called me yesterday to apologize had a bad night i fully understood and forgave her i love tiffany doing great has anyone noticed that the top shows on  and cable ratings are those that are fair or great to your favorite president me congratulations to  for being the number one shoe on cable television the ig found that james comey leaked classified documents to his attorneys which can be is a violation of the espionage act this is consistent with all the lies that comey has been spreading     cory is doing a great job for colorado  nobody knows more about healthcare than john great guy  an amazing guy respected by all  nobody works harder or smarter than joni  one of the greats  great job thom  thank you kevin great things are happening at the border  i am monitoring hurricane dorian and receiving frequent briefings and updates it is important to heed the directions of your state and local officials this is an extremely dangerous storm please prepare and be safe       pass the laugh test and the inspector general just knocked that down    they could have charged comey with theft of government documents 641 of the criminal code because the ig found these were not his personal documents these were government documents   comey's claim that these were just his own personal recollections would not just arrived at camp david the great state of north carolina has early voting for a very important congressional ninth race please vote early now or on election day september 10th for dan bishop a great guy his opponent wants open borders sanctuary cities  is weak on crime military  vets this should never happen to another president again  fallout from ig's scathing comey report  one of the most disgraceful examples of an abuse of power by a government officialwhen you read this reportthis is a systematic effort to go after candidate trump president elect-trump and president trumpyou could virtually call this an attempted coup   thanks  true  the united states of america was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the safir slv launch at semnan launch site one in iran i wish iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at site one  if the fed would cut we would have one of the biggest stock market increases in a long time badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small tariffs instead of themselves for bad managementand who can really blame them for doing that excuses we don't have a tariff problem we are reigning in bad and/or unfair players we have a fed problem they don't have a clue the euro is dropping against the dollar like crazy giving them a big export and manufacturing advantageand the fed does nothing our dollar is now the strongest in history sounds good doesn't it except to those manufacturers that make product for sale outside the us bryan dean wright former cia officerdem in 2016 we had a coup we have to take comey and others to task makes no sense not to prosecute him comey got a book deal i fear for my country he tried to kneecap our duly elected president and there are no consequences  the fact that james comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable attorney general bill barr is so many people and experts that i have watched and read would have taken an entirely different course comey got lucky the disastrous ig report on james comey shows in the strongest of terms how unfairly i and tens of millions of great people who support me were treated our rights and liberties were illegally stripped away by this dishonest fool we should be given our stolen time back an idea liked by many  general motors which was once the giant of detroit is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there they moved major plants to china before i came into office this was done despite the saving help given them by the usa now they should start moving back to america again establishment of the us space command  perhaps never in the history of our country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than james comey in the just released inspector general's report he should be ashamed of himself the farmers are going to be so happy when they see what we are doing for ethanol not even including the e-15 year around which is already done it will be a giant package get ready at the same time i was able to save the small refineries from certain closing great for all the economy is doing great with tremendous upside potential if the fed would do what they should we are a rocket upward the totally inaccurate reporting by lawrence o'donnell for which he has been forced by nbc to apologize is no different than the horrible corrupt and fraudulent fake news that i and many millions of great supporters have had to put up with for years so bad for the usa for the most ridiculous claim of all that russia russia russia or russian oligarchs co-signed loan documents for me a guarantee totally false as is virtually everything else he and much of the rest of the lamestream media has said about me for years all apologize crazy lawrence o'donnell who has been calling me wrong from even before i announced my run for the presidency even being previously forced by nbc to apologize which he did while crying for things he said about me  the apprentice was again forced to apologize this time hurricane dorian looks like it will be hitting florida late sunday night be prepared and please follow state and federal instructions it will be a very big hurricane perhaps one of the biggest puerto rico is in great shape with hurricane dorian taking a largely different route than anticipated thank you to fema first responders and all for working so hard  being so well prepared a great result the bad news florida get ready storm is building and will be big there has never been a time in the history of our country that the media was so fraudulent fake or corrupt when the age of trump is looked back on many years from now i only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the fake news the  amazon washington post and  just did a fake interview on pardons for aids on the wall and that i didn't think the wall on the southern border was that important to stop illegals wanting to come into our country wrong vitally important will make a big impact so bad a sad day for the democrats kirsten gillibrand has dropped out of the presidential primary i'm glad they never found out that she was the one i was really afraid of thank you for the support as we make america great again  another totally fake story in the amazon washington post lobbyist which states that if my aides broke the law to build the wall which is going up rapidly i would give them a pardon this was made up by the washington post only in order to demean and disparage fake news the wall is going up very fast despite total obstruction by democrats in congress and elsewhere   and by the way i'm the best thing that's ever happened to puerto rico puerto rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth their political system is broken and their politicians are either incompetent or corrupt congress approved billions of dollars last time more than anyplace else has ever gotten and it is sent to crooked pols no good our federal reserve cannot mentally keep up with the competition other countries at the g-7 in france all of the other leaders were giddy about how low their interest costs have gone germany is actually getting paid to borrow money zero interest plus no clue fed i don't want to win for myself i only want to win for the people the new  is letting millions of great people down we have to start looking for a new news outlet fox isn't working for us anymore are all in for the open border socialists or beyond fox hires give hillary the questions  juan williams and low ratings shep smith hopeless  clueless they should go all the way left and i will still find a way to win that's what i do win too bad just watched  heavily promoting the democrats through their dnc communications director spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback by anchor  terrible considering that fox couldn't even land a debate the dems give them nothing    would be very hard for jeremy corbyn the leader of britain's labour party to seek a no-confidence vote against new prime minister boris johnson especially in light of the fact that boris is exactly what the uk has been looking for  will prove to be a great one love uk we are tracking closely tropical storm dorian as it heads as usual to puerto rico fema and all others are ready  and will do a great job when they do let them know it and give them a big thank you not like last time that includes from the incompetent mayor of san juan so interesting to read and see all of the free and interesting advice i am getting on china from people who have tried to handle it before and failed miserably in fact they got taken to the cleaners we are doing very well with china this has never happened to them before the infestation of bedbugs at the new york times office   was perhaps brought in by lightweight journalist bret stephens a conservative who does anything that his bosses at the paper tell him to do he is now quitting twitter after being called a bedbug tough guy a made up radical left story about doral bedbugs but bret stephens is loaded up with them been calling me wrong for years along with the few remaining never trumpers all losers  another is a one-time bad congressman from illinois who lost in his second term by a landslide then failed in radio the third is a man who couldn't stand up straight while receiving an award i should be able to take them can you believe it i'm at 94percent approval in the republican party and have three stooges running against me one is mr appalachian trail who was actually in argentina for bad reasons axios whatever that is sat back and said geeeee let's see what can we make up today to embarrass the president then they said why don't we say he wants to bomb a hurricane that should do it the media in our country is totally out of control they do stories so big on elizabeth pocahontas warren's crowd sizes adding many more people than are actually there and yet my crowds which are far bigger get no coverage at all fake news it is amazing that i can be at 51percent with zogby when the fake  corrupt news is almost 100percent against me great job mr president the g7 in france was so successful and yet when i came back and read the corrupt and fake news and watched numerous networks it was not even recognizable from what actually took place at the great g7 event looking forward to being with dan bishop in two weeks in north carolina his opponent believes in open borders and sanctuary cities and won't protect your second amendment   pirro is following up her  best seller with another book that is destined to also be   radicals resistance and revenge the left's plot to remake america out today go get it the federal reserve loves watching our manufacturers struggle with their exports to the benefit of other parts of the world has anyone looked at what almost all other countries are doing to take advantage of the good old usa our fed has been calling it wrong for too long 100percent confirmed  wow yet another big storm heading to puerto rico will it ever end congress approved 92 billion dollars for puerto rico last year an all time record of its kind for anywhere the g-7 was a great success for the usa and all lamestream media coverage bore no relationship to what actually happened in france fake news it was great no bedbugs at doral the radical left democrats upon hearing that the perfectly located for the next g-7 doral national miami was under consideration for the next g-7 spread that false and nasty rumor not nice starting to look good for the highly respected prime minister of the italian republic giuseppe conte represented italy powerfully at the g-7 loves his country greatly  works well with the usa a very talented man who will hopefully remain prime minister i have gotten to know president  well in our dealings with brazil he is working very hard on the amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of brazil not easy he and his country have the full and complete support of the usa can you believe it i'm at 94percent approval in the republican party and have three stooges running against me one is mr appalachian trail who was actually in argentina for bad reasons just returned to washington from france and the very successful g-7 only to find that the fake news is still trying to perpetuate the phony story that i wanted to use nuclear weapons to blow up hurricanes before they reach shore this is so ridiculous never happened starting to look good for the highly respected prime minister of the italian republic giuseppi conte represented italy powerfully at the g-7 loves his country greatly  works well with the usa a very talented man who will hopefully remain prime minister thank you mark  i agree 100percent  thank you france🇺🇸🇫🇷  just wrapped up a great

from iran to china tariffs to boris a disgrace  great meetings at the  in biarritz france   thank you eric so true  usmca make it bipartisan everybody wants it  jesse  emma great news congratulations  happy birthday vince  the question i was asked most today by fellow world leaders who think the usa is doing so well and is stronger than ever before happens to be mr president why does the american

meetings the leaders are getting along very well and our country economically is doing great the talk of the world before i arrived in france the fake and disgusting news was saying that relations with the 6 others countries in the g-7 are very tense and that the two days of meetings will be a disaster just like they are trying to force a recession they are trying to will america into the media is destroying the free press mark levin so true thank you both sooo nice  france and president  have done a really great job thus far with a very important g-7 lunch with emmanuel was the best meeting we have yet had likewise evening meeting with world leaders went very well progress being made our great economy is the talk of everyone north carolina governor cooper vetoed a bill that would have required sheriffs to cooperate with ice this is a terrible decision for the great people of north carolina he should reverse his decision and get back to the basics of fighting crime looking forward to helping new york city and governor  complete the long anticipated and partially built second avenue subway would be extended to east 125th street in harlem long in the making they now have the team that can get it done just had lunch with french president  many good things are happening for both of our countries big weekend with other world leaders face it you probably got a tax cut this was a new york times headline and it is very true if republicans take back the house and keep the senate and presidency one of our first acts will be to approve a major middle income tax cut democrats only want to raise your taxes having fun i was smiling as i looked up and around the many reporters with me were smiling also they knew the truthand yet when i saw the reporting cnn msnbc and other fake news outlets covered it as serious news  me thinking of myself as the messiah no more trust when i looked up to the sky and jokingly said i am the chosen one at a press conference two days ago referring to taking on trade with china little did i realize that the media would claim that i had a messiah complex they knew i was kidding being sarcastic and just france and president  have done a really great job thus far with a very important g-7 lunch with emanuel was the best meeting we have yet had likewise evening meeting with world leaders went very well progress being made for all of the fake news reporters that don't have a clue as to what the law is relative to presidential powers china etc try looking at the emergency economic powers act of 1977 case closed just had lunch with french president  many good things are happening for both of our countries big weekend with other world leaders such a sad and pathetic fall for  and jeff z  other good polls also in fifties despite only fake news and then phony polls by ap cnn nbc and as always fox who were way off on 2016 election  disgraceful  thank you ivanka really amazing  looking forward to being with great leaders in france leaving soon  highest condolences thank you vp  great going harris  great he said maga country did it so terrible  thank you to  for the really nice words and thoughts on  tonight hosted by lou's friend  great job by all ps check out these two great women on tour tomorrow night in nyc at the marriott marquis hotel broadway have fun just spoke with president  of brazil our future trade prospects are very exciting and our relationship is strong perhaps stronger than ever before i told him if the united states can help with the amazon rainforest fires we stand ready to assist additionally the remaining 300 billion dollars of goods and products from china that was being taxed from september 1st at 10percent will now be taxed at 15percent thank you for your attention to this matter unfair trading relationship china should not have put new tariffs on 75 billion dollars of united states product politically motivated starting on october 1st the 250 billion dollars of goods and products from china currently being taxed at 25percent will be taxed at 30percent sadly past administrations have allowed china to get so far ahead of fair and balanced trade that it has become a great burden to the american taxpayer as president i can no longer allow this to happen in the spirit of achieving fair trade we must balance this very for many years china and many other countries has been taking advantage of the united states on trade intellectual property theft and much more our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to china with no end in sight the dow is down 573 points perhaps on the news that representative seth moulton whoever that may be has dropped out of the 2020 presidential race all deliveries of fentanyl from china or anywhere else fentanyl kills 100000 americans a year president xi said this would stop it didn't our economy because of our gains in the last 2 1/2 years is much larger than that of china we will keep it that way your companies home and making your products in the usa i will be responding to china's tariffs this afternoon this is a great opportunity for the united states also i am ordering all carriers including fed ex amazon ups and the post office to search for  refuse better off without them the vast amounts of money made and stolen by china from the united states year after year for decades will and must stop our great american companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to china including bringing our country has lost stupidly trillions of dollars with china over many years they have stolen our intellectual property at a rate of hundreds of billions of dollars a year  they want to continue i won't let that happen we don't need china and frankly would be far my only question is who is our bigger enemy jay powell or chairman xi as usual the fed did nothing it is incredible that they can speak without knowing or asking what i am doing which will be announced shortly we have a very strong dollar and a very weak fed i will work brilliantly with both and the us will do great now the fed can show their stuff this despite the fake news and polls  willing to lose their wealth or a big part of it just for the possibility of winning the election but it won't work because i always find a way to win especially for the people the greatest political movement in the history of our country will have another big win in 2020 the economy is strong and good whereas the rest of the world is not doing so well despite this the fake news media together with their partner the democrat party are working overtime to convince people that we are in or will soon be going into a recession they are 94percent approval rating within the  republican party thank you happy birthday james   has done a fantastic job representing the people of colorado he really knows how to win strong on crime borders  the 2nd a cory fights hard for our military  vets john hickenlooper is badly damaged after his horrible run for president big primary trouble my only question is who is our bigger enemy jay powel or chairman xi as usual the fed did nothing it is incredible that they can speak without knowing or asking what i am doing which will be announced shortly we have a very strong dollar and a very weak fed i will work brilliantly with both and the us will do great congratulations to the great bob cousy  looking forward to soon being in north carolina to hold a big rally for wonderful dan bishop who is running for congress his opponent wants open borders sanctuary cities and socialism he likes the squad more than north carolina dan has my full and complete endorsement check out a fantastic new book still winning  why america went all in on donald trump-and why we must do it again by the great writer  an excellent read thank you i am hopeful congress will engage with my team to pass meaningful legislation that will make a real difference and most importantly save lives just concluded a very good meeting on preventing mass shootings talks are ongoing w/ both republicans  democrats we are likewise engaging with lawful gun owners survivors grieving family members law enforcement the nra mental health professionals and school officials just heard that sean spicer will be on dancing with the stars he will do great a terrific person who loves our country dearly the economy is doing really well the federal reserve can easily make it record setting the question is being asked why are we paying much more in interest than germany and certain other countries be early for a change not late let america win big rather than just win germany sells 30 year bonds offering negative yields germany competes with the usa our federal reserve does not allow us to do what we must do they put us at a disadvantage against our competition strong dollar no inflation they move like quicksand fight or go home thank you   it was my honor to sign a presidential memorandum facilitating the cancellation of student loan debt for 25k of our most severely disabled veterans with today's order we express the everlasting love  loyalty of a truly grateful nation god bless our vets  god bless america  great  interviewed on  tonight at 9:00 pm   that when this administration's alternative is no longer available california will squeeze them to a point of business ruin only reason california is now talking to them is because the feds are giving a far better alternative which is much better for consumers henry ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car that is far less safe and doesn't work as well because execs don't want to fight california regulators car companies should know the legendary henry ford and alfred p sloan the founders of ford motor company and general motors are rolling over at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good and cost $3000 more to consumers crazy tax cuts deregulation and an administration dedicated to growing business have allowed the us economy to flourish the resulting surge in job creation and record low unemployment has put the american worker in the driver's seat    very unfair to the united states  because of me these countries have agreed to pay one hundred billion dollars more but still way short of what they should pay for the incredible military protection provided sorry for the record denmark is only at 135percent of gdp for nato spending they are a wealthy country and should be at 2percent we protect europe and yet only 8 of the 28 nato countries are at the 2percent mark the united states is at a much much higher level than that on my way to the great commonwealth of kentucky to deliver remarks at the  75th annual national convention look forward to being with all of my friends   where is the federal reserve so germany is paying zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money while the us a far stronger and more important credit is paying interest and just stopped i hope quantitative tightening strongest dollar in history very tough on exports no inflation my proposal to the politically correct automobile companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000 while at the same time making the cars substantially safer engines would run smoother very little impact on the environment foolish executives we are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate and we should be lower than them yesterday highest dollar in ushistory no inflation wake up federal reserve such growth potential almost like never before doing great with china and other trade deals the only problem we have is jay powell and the fed he's like a golfer who can't putt has no touch big us growth if he does the right thing big cut but don't count on him so far he has called it wrong and only let us down the fake news lamestream media is doing everything possible the create a us recession even though the numbers  facts are working totally in the opposite direction they would be willing to hurt many people but that doesn't matter to them our economy is sooo strong sorry the speed bump has been missteps by the federal reserve     so true the speed bump has been missteps by the federal reserve     so true rep tlaib wants to cut off aid to israel this is the new face the of democrat party read the aoc plus 3 statements on their hatred of jews and israel check out rep omar

president trump is the greatest president for jews and for israel in the history of the world not just america he is the best president for israel in the history of the worldand the jewish people in israel love him the prime minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the united states and denmark by being so direct i thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future denmark is a very special country with incredible people but based on prime minister mette frederiksen's comments that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of greenland i will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time congratulations  and  on the birth of carolina dorothy trump so proud  sorry i don't buy rep tlaib's tears i have watched her violence craziness and most importantly words for far too long now tears she hates israel and all jewish people she is an anti-semite she and her 3 friends are the new face of the democrat party live with it the lamestream media is far beyond fake news they are treading in very dangerous territory  thank you  just another disgruntled former employee who got fired for gross incompetence  ratings are way down lost all credibility beautiful to watch  maria despite all of their will and energy it won't work  thank you mike  two incredible people i can't believe they're not working few work harder  the fake and corrupt media is sooo bad for our country the enemy of the people  congratulations great show  thank you jon working hard  nobody ever heard of this dope until he met me he only lasted 11 days  i promise not to do this to greenland  thank you to my great supporters at the 2019   great discussion with prime minister  today we talked about brexit and how we can move rapidly on a us-uk free trade deal i look forward to meeting with boris this weekend at the  in france spoke to my two good friends prime minister modi of india and prime minister khan of pakistan regarding trade strategic partnerships and most importantly for india and pakistan to work towards reducing tensions in kashmir a tough situation but good conversations thank you   massive overflow crowds in new hampshire last week couldn't get into packed snhu arena fake and corrupt news would like you to believe otherwise make america great again  wow report just out google manipulated from 26 million to 16 million votes for hillary clinton in 2016 election this was put out by a clinton supporter not a trump supporter google should be sued my victory was even bigger than thought  the fed rate over a fairly short period of time should be reduced by at least 100 basis points with perhaps some quantitative easing as well if that happened our economy would be even better and the world economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced-good for everyone our economy is very strong despite the horrendous lack of vision by jay powell and the fed but the democrats are trying to will the economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 election  very selfish our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world democrats want open borders and crime so dangerous for our country but we are building a big beautiful new wall i will protect america the dems don't know where to start  got fired wrote a very nice book about me just recently now the book is a lie said his wife was driving him crazy something big was happening with her getting divorced he was a mental wreck we didn't want him around now fake news puts him on like he was my buddy anthony scaramucci is a highly unstable nut job who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellacked  then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign i barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool of himself bad on tv abused staff great cohesion inside the republican party the best i have ever seen despite all of the fake news my poll numbers are great new internal polls show them to be the strongest we've had so far think what they'd be if i got fair media coverage got fired wrote a very nice book about me just recently now the book is a lie said his wife was driving him crazy something big was happening with her getting divorced he was a mental wreck we didn't want him around now fake news puts him on like he was my buddy anthony scaramucci is a highly unstable nut job who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellaced and then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign i barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool of himself bad on tv abused staff the new york times will be out of business soon after i leave office hopefully in 6 years they have zero credibility and are losing a fortune even now especially after their massive unfunded liability i'm fairly certain they'll endorse me just to keep it all going thank you  i couldn't agree more  house democrats want to take action against israel because it is fighting back against two maybe four people that have said unthinkably bad things about it  the israeli people dems have such disdain for israel what happened aoc plus 4 is the new face of the democrat party our economy is the best in the world by far lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories poised for big growth after trade deals are completed import prices down china eating tariffs helping targeted farmers from big tariff money coming in great future for usa juan williams at  is so pathetic and yet when he met me in the fox building lobby he couldn't have been nicer as he asked me to take a picture of him and me for his family yet he is always nasty and wrong we are doing very well with china and talking doing really well  make america great again with all that this administration has accomplished think what my poll numbers would be if we had an honest media which we do not journalism has reached a new low in the history of our country it is nothing more than an evil propaganda machine for the democrat party the reporting is so false biased and evil that it has now become a very sick jokebut the public is aware  the failing new york times in one of the most devastating portrayals of bad journalism in history got caught by a leaker that they are shifting  from their phony russian collusion narrative the mueller report  his testimony were a total disaster to a racism witch hunt such a disgrace at the once great   thank you  the fake news media hates to see this  thank you to  a great and legitimate reporter as opposed to those at the

trade deal with the us done china could have it first recession or worse in years there's disinvestment in china right now also the fed is too tight i agree steve moore heritage foundation sadly much truth to this  andrew thank you we will never forgive or forget  biden doesn't have a clue i will solve the china problem  the fake news media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my re-election the problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on trade and everyone knows that including china representatives omar and tlaib are the face of the democrat party and they hate israel wow the deputy editor of the failing new york times was just demoted should have been fired totally biased and inaccurate reporting the paper is a fraud zero credibility fake news takes another hit but this time a big one our great farmers know how important it is to win on trade they will be the big winners the united states is now by far the biggest strongest and most powerful economy in the world it is not even close as others falter we will only get stronger consumers are in the best shape ever plenty of cash business optimism is at an all time high if president xi would meet directly and personally with the protesters there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the hong kong problem i have no doubt  it would show great weakness if israel allowed rep omar and reptlaib to visit they hate israel  all jewish people  there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds minnesota and michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office they are a disgrace the philadelphia shooter should never have been allowed to be on the streets he had a long and very dangerous criminal record looked like he was having a good time after his capture and after wounding so many police long sentence must get much tougher on street crime what they were doing there's plenty of indication we don't have to speculate  holy cow got to read this book  wow    a very serious situation can never be allowed to happen again drain the swamp go out and get andrew mccarthy's new book ball of collusion supervision became the investigator and when they pushed the envelope there was nobody there to tell them no it goes right to the president obama plenty of information that obama was informed  knew exactly thank you and the wall is under major construction  two great entertainers and more importantly great people check out their show  i know president xi of china very well he is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people he is also a good man in a tough business i have zero doubt that if president xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the hong kong problem he can do it personal meeting deferral to december it actually helps china more than us but will be reciprocated millions of jobs are being lost in china to other non-tariffed countries thousands of companies are leaving of course china wants to make a deal let them work humanely with hong kong first good things were stated on the call with china the other day they are eating the tariffs with the devaluation of their currency and pouring money into their system the american consumer is fine with or without the september date but much good will come from the short sad  unlike others our economy is strong  spread is way too much as other countries say thank you to clueless jay powell and the federal reserve germany and many others are playing the game crazy inverted yield curve we should easily be reaping big rewards  gains but the fed is holding us back we will win we are winning big time against china companies  jobs are fleeing prices to us have not gone up and in some cases have come down china is not our problem though hong kong is not helping our problem is with the fed raised too much  too fast now too slow to cut the great charles payne  correctly stated that fed chair jay powell made two enormous mistakes 1 when he said mid cycle adjustment 2 we're data dependent  he did not do the right thing i agree to put it mildly  tremendous amounts of money pouring into the united states people want safety so far you've had tariffs imposed on 300 billion dollars worth of chinese products but you can't tell me that it has hurt our economy it really hasn't led to any kind of serious rise in prices at the consumer level     and we are taking in $billions the fed has got to do something the fed is the central bank of the united states not the central bank of the world mark grant    correct the federal reserve acted far too quickly and now is very very late too bad so much to gain on the upside join me tomorrow night in manchester new hampshire at 7:00 pm eastern   a fighter and champion great  rt   is real we need  now  great interview of ron vitiello former acting ice director by  on  about all of the work that is being  has been done on our southern border thanks ron terrific job now if only the democrats would fix the loopholes  asylum great day in the incredible commonwealth of pennsylvania today with the amazing energy workers construction workers and craft workers who make america run  and who make america proud no one in the world does it better than you  no debate on election security should go forward without first agreeing that voter id identification must play a very strong part in any final agreement without voter id it is all so meaningless thank you bill  true without being stuck at an airport where cnn buys at a big price an uninterested audience they've got nothing going  is bad for america  it always happens when a conservative does even a fraction of what chris cuomo did with his lunatic ranting raving  cursing they get destroyed by the fake news but when a liberal democrat like chris cuomo does it republicans immediately come to his defense we never learn see you in new hampshire  just leaving incredible complex jobs jobs jobs  so terrible  put it back up we are living with a rigged  fake media  just landed in pennsylvania looking forward to making a speech on energy so important our intelligence has informed us that the chinese government is moving troops to the border with hong kong everyone should be calm and safe many are blaming me and the united states for the problems going on in hong kong i can't imagine why all the news that's not fit to print the new york times is no longer the paper we grew up with it is no longer a news organization it is now an agenda driven organization out to change the country for the worse michael goodwin highly respected new york post columnist as usual china said they were going to be buying big from our great american farmers so far they have not done what they said maybe this will be different would chris cuomo be given a red flag for his recent rant filthy language and a total loss of control he shouldn't be allowed to have any weapon he's nuts thank you steve  through massive devaluation of their currency and pumping vast sums of money into their system the tens of billions of dollars that the us is receiving is a gift from china prices not up no inflation farmers getting more than china would be spending fake news won't report i thought chris was fredo also the truth hurts totally lost it low ratings   thank you john you are a special guy  curt schilling a great pitcher and patriot is considering a run for congress in arizona terrific   rt  this is cnn   the united states is learning much from the failed missile explosion in russia we have similar though more advanced technology the russian skyfall explosion has people worried about the air around the facility and far beyond not good two great and loyal friends  scaramucci who like so many others had nothing to do with my election victory is only upset that i didn't want him back in the administration where he desperately wanted to be also i seldom had time to return his many calls to me he just wanted to be on tv rt  they call it thursday at the amazon washington post  washington post 'embarrassed' over gaffe-filled story needing thank you negop  many incredible things are happening right now for our country after years of being ripped off by other nations on both trade deals and the military things are changing fast big progress is being made america is respected again keep america great tv talent then during the 2016 election i would watch as joe scarborough  his very angry psycho wife would push donny to the point of total humiliation he would never fight back because he wanted to stay on tv even on a very low rated show all in the name of ambition so funny to watch little donny deutsch on tv with his own failing show when i did the apprentice donny would call me along with   others and beg to be on that very successful show he had the tv bug  i would let him come on though he  erin had very little other than the fact that this administration has probably done more than any other administration in its first 2 1/2 years of existence anthony who would do anything to come back in should remember the only reason he is on tv and it's not for being the mooch anthony scaramucci who was quickly terminated 11 days from a position that he was totally incapable of handling now seems to do nothing but television as the all time expert on president trump like many other so-called television experts he knows very little about me joe biden just said we believe in facts not truth does anybody really believe he is mentally fit to be president we are playing in a very big and complicated world joe doesn't have a clue think how wonderful it is to be able to fight back and show to so many how totally dishonest the fake news media really is it may be the most corrupt and disgusting business almost there is make america great again china wants to make a deal so badly thousands of companies are leaving because of the tariffs they must stem the flow at the same time china may be hoping for a democrat to win so they could continue the great ripoff of america  the theft of hundreds of billions of $'s cause big disruption by going to manhattan working almost all of the time including evenings don't have to be in wh to do thatand sooo many other false statements he is right about one thing though i will win again in 2020 otherwise he pays 95percent in taxes got to see by accident wacko comedian bill maher's show so many lies he said patients in el paso hospital didn't want to meet with me wrong had really great meetings with numerous patients said i was on vacation wrong long planned fix up of wh stay here rather than never has the press been more inaccurate unfair or corrupt we are not fighting the democrats they are easy we are fighting the seriously dishonest and unhinged lamestream media they have gone totally crazy make america great again also a small apology for testing the short range missiles and that this testing would stop when the exercises end i look forward to seeing kim jong un in the not too distant future a nuclear free north korea will lead to one of the most successful countries in the world in a letter to me sent by kim jong un he stated very nicely that he would like to meet and start negotiations as soon as the joint us/south korea joint exercise are over it was a long letter much of it complaining about the ridiculous and expensive exercises it was maggie haberman of the failing  reported that i was annoyed by the lack of cameras inside the hospitals in dayton  el paso when in fact i was the one who stated very strongly that i didn't want the fake news inside  told my people not to let them in fake reporting rt  breaking documents were unsealed yesterday revealing that top democrats including bill clinton took private trips to to inflame and cause chaos they create their own violence and then try to blame others they are the true racists and are very bad for our country liberal hollywood is racist at the highest level and with great anger and hate they like to call themselves elite but they are not elite in fact it is often the people that they so strongly oppose that are actually the elite the movie coming out is made in order mentally ill or deranged people i am the biggest second amendment person there is but we all must work together for the good and safety of our country common sense things can be done that are good for everyone serious discussions are taking place between house and senate leadership  on meaningful background checks i have also been speaking to the nra and others so that their very strong views can be fully represented and respected guns should not be placed in the hands of rt  imagine living in a time when a national newspaper revises its front page headline because the lefties can't handle truth rt  listen to my chat with maggie haberman from the failing ‘why has the failing nyt changed its headline'  rod blagojevich the former governor of illinois was sentenced to 14 years in prison he has served 7 years many people have asked that i study the possibility of commuting his sentence in that it was a very severe one white house staff is continuing the review of this matter career in the military retiring from the us navy in 2010 he commanded at every level including the naval special warfare command he has also served as a national security fellow at harvard university i have no doubt he will do a great job i am pleased to inform you that the honorable joseph maguire current director of the national counterterrorism center will be named acting director of national intelligence effective august 15th admiral maguire has a long and distinguished coincides with the retirement of dan coats a new acting director of national intelligence will be named shortly sue gordon is a great professional with a long and distinguished career i have gotten to know sue over the past 2 years and have developed great respect for her sue has announced she will be leaving on august 15 which i know emmanuel means well as do all others but nobody speaks for the united states but the united states itself no one is authorized in any way shape or form to represent us iran is in serious financial trouble they want desperately to talk to the us but are given mixed signals from all of those purporting to represent us including president macron of france in the world there is nobody even close but unfortunately the same cannot be said about our federal reserve they have called it wrong at every step of the way and we are still winning can you imagine what would happen if they actually called it right john deere our car companies  others to compete on a level playing field with substantial fed cuts there is no inflation and no quantitative tightening the dollar will make it possible for our companies to win against any competition we have the greatest companies as your president one would think that i would be thrilled with our very strong dollar i am not the fed's high interest rate level in comparison to other countries is keeping the dollar high making it more difficult for our great manufacturers like caterpillar boeing i don't know who juaquin castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate 1percent who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth juaquin is not the man that his brother is but his brother according to most is not much keep fighting juaquin i am so amazed that msnbc  cnn can keep putting on over and over again people that have no idea what i am all about and yet they speak as experts on trump same people since long before the 2016 election and how did that work out for the haters and losers not well just watched a world class loser tim o'brien who i haven't seen or spoken to in many years  knows nothing about me except that he wrote a failed hit piece book about me 15 years ago fired like a dog from other jobs saw him on lyin' brian williams trump slam show bad tv my time spent in dayton and el paso with some of the greatest people on earth thank you for a job well done  incredible afternoon in el paso texas we love you and are with you all the way  the dems new weapon is actually their old weapon one which they never cease to use when they are down or run out of facts racism they are truly disgusting they even used it on nancy pelosi i will be putting out a list of all people who have been so ridiculously accused leaving el paso for the white house what great people i met there and in dayton ohio the fake news worked overtime trying to disparage me and the two trips but it just didn't work the love respect  enthusiasm were there for all to see they have been through so much sad i don't know who joaquin castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate 1percent who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth joaquin is not the man that his brother is but his brother according to most is not much keep fighting joaquin the people i met today in dayton are the finest anywhere  we love you dayton ohio  watching fake news cnn is better than watching shepard smith the lowest rated show on  actually whenever possible i turn to  misrepresenting what took place inside of the hospital their news conference after i left for el paso was a fraud it bore no resemblance to what took place with those incredible people that i was so lucky to meet and spend time with they were all amazingo just left dayton ohio where i met with the victims  families law enforcement medical staff  first responders it was a warm  wonderful visit tremendous enthusiasm  even love then i saw failed presidential candidate 0percent sherrod brown  mayor whaley totally watching sleepy joe biden making a speech sooo boring the lamestream media will die in the ratings and clicks with this guy it will be over for them not to mention the fact that our country will do poorly with him it will be one big crash but at least china will be happy today we honor all of our country's purple heart recipients their loved ones and our gold star families for their immeasurable sacrifice these american patriots represent the unyielding and unmatched strength and determination of the us armed forces   terrible thing to watch especially when things could be taken care of sooo easily we will win anyway but it would be much easier if the fed understood which they don't that we are competing against other countries all of whom want to do well at our expense proud to admit their mistake of acting too fast and tightening too much and that i was right they must cut rates bigger and faster and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening now yield curve is at too wide a margin and no inflation incompetence is a three more central banks cut rates our problem is not china we are stronger than ever money is pouring into the us while china is losing companies by the thousands to other countries and their currency is under siege our problem is a federal reserve that is too meanwhile the dayton ohio shooter had a history of supporting political figures like bernie sanders elizabeth warren and antifa   i hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to fake news thank you this is an astounding development in journalism i've never seen it happen before i've just never seen anything like this is that journalism today i don't think so mark penn former clinton advisor  after 3 years i almost got a good headline from the times trump urges unity vs racism was the correct description in the first headline by the failing new york times but it was quickly changed to assailing hate but not guns after the radical left democrats went absolutely crazy fake news that's what we're up against talks have begun to further increase payments to the united states south korea is a very wealthy nation that now feels an obligation to contribute to the military defense provided by the united states of america the relationship between the two countries is a very good one south korea has agreed to pay substantially more money to the united states in order to defend itself from north korea over the past many decades the us has been paid very little by south korea but last year at the request of president trump south korea paid $990000000 beto phony name to indicate hispanic heritage o'rourke who is embarrassed by my last visit to the great state of texas where i trounced him and is now even more embarrassed by polling at 1percent in the democrat primary should respect the victims  law enforcement  be quiet amendment john yoo   former governor jerry brown vetoed the same bill in that it was ridiculous and totally unconstitutional just more of the record setting presidential harassment don't feel badly new york state is far worse california is trying to meddle with a ballot in order to oppose president trump and it's clearly something california is not allowed to do it violates the right of the republican party or any party to choose its leaders under the free speech clause and under the 14th will be going to dayton ohio and el paso texas tomorrow to meet with first responders law enforcement and some of the victims of the terrible shootings in 2020 lou dobbs stated that this is a fraud on the american public  stated with certainty that they suppressed negative stories on hillary clinton and boosted negative stories on donald trump all very illegal we are watching google very closely  are not planning to illegally subvert the 2020 election despite all that has been said to the contrary it all sounded good until i watched kevin cernekee a google engineer say terrible things about what they did in 2016 and that they want to make sure that trump losses  of google was in the oval office working very hard to explain how much he liked me what a great job the administration is doing that google was not involved with china's military that they didn't help crooked hillary over me in the 2016 election  that they thank you    thank you mr wonderful i like you too    as they have learned in the last two years our great american farmers know that china will not be able to hurt them in that their president has stood with them and done what no other president would do and i'll do it again next year if necessary massive amounts of money from china and other parts of the world is pouring into the united states for reasons of safety investment and interest rates we are in a very strong position companies are also coming to the us in big numbers a beautiful thing to watch in 2020 lou dobbs stated that this is a fraud on the american public  stated with certainty that they suppressed negative stories on hillary clinton and boosted negative stories on donald ttump all very illegal we are watching google very closely are not planning to illegally subvert the 2020 election

they didn't help crooked hillary over me in the 2016 election and that they it's political season and the election is around the corner they want to continue to push that racist narrative    and i am the least racist person black hispanic and asian unemployment is the lowest best in the history of the united states did george bush ever condemn president obama after sandy hook president obama had 32 mass shootings during his reign not many people said obama is out of control mass shootings were happening before the president even thought about running for pres   thank you   check out what  is up to for the 2020 election   thank you  and tom homan  we must honor the sacred memory of those we have lost by acting as one people open wounds cannot heal if we are divided we must seek real bipartisan solutions that will truly make america safer and better for all  today i am also directing the department of justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty and that this capital punishment be delivered quickly decisively and without years of needless delay  the first lady and i join all americans in praying and grieving for the victims their families and the survivors we will stand by their side forever  china is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of billions of dollars they have been taking from the us with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation so one-sided it should have been stopped many years ago used currency manipulation to steal our businesses and factories hurt our jobs depress our workers' wages and harm our farmers' prices not anymore based on the historic currency manipulation by china it is now even more obvious to everyone that americans are not paying for the tariffs  they are being paid for compliments of china and the us is taking in tens of billions of dollars china has always china dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low it's called currency manipulation are you listening federal reserve this is a major violation which will greatly weaken china over time rt  strong people stand up for themselvesbut stronger people stand up for othersthank you president  for stan the media has a big responsibility to life and safety in our country fake news has contributed greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years news coverage has got to start being fair balanced and unbiased or these terrible problems will only get worse this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform we must have something good if not great come out of these two tragic events we cannot let those killed in el paso texas and dayton ohio die in vain likewise for those so seriously wounded we can never forget them and those many

from fed countries are coming to us wanting to negotiate real trade deals not the one sided horror show deals made by past administrations they don't want to be targeted for tariffs by the us rt  the nipple-height mayor of londonistan has never been so unpopular he has minus approval ratings because we are stab-city great working with you john a big win for our amazing ranchers  rt  after a man is hacked to death in broad daylight by a syrian migrant with a samurai sword merkel's media says differences a great couple  nice to see that one of my best pupils is still a giant trump fan steve joined me after i won the primaries but i loved working with him  john has therefore decided to stay in congress where he has done such an outstanding job representing the people of texas and our country i will be announcing my nomination for dni shortly our great republican congressman john ratcliffe is being treated very unfairly by the lamestream media rather than going through months of slander and libel i explained to john how miserable it would be for him and his family to deal with these people a$ap rocky released from prison and on his way home to the united states from sweden it was a rocky week get home asap a$ap chariman kim has a great and beautiful vision for his country and only the united states with me as president can make that vision come true he will do the right thing because he is far too smart not to and he does not want to disappoint his friend president trump chairman kim does not want to disappoint me with a violation of trust there is far too much for north korea to gain the potential as a country under kim jong un's leadership is unlimited also there is far too much to lose i may be wrong but i believe that kim jong un and north korea tested 3 short range missiles over the last number of days these missiles tests are not a violation of our signed singapore agreement nor was there discussion of short range missiles when we shook hands there may be a united nations violation but really bad news the baltimore house of elijah cummings was robbed too bad thank you ohio   i would like to thank two great iowa senators  and  for their support today on the spending bill their vote and the vote of other republicans and democrats helped get this done in a bipartisan fashion thank you all beautiful evening in cincinnati ohio tonight  with great american patriots   thank you cincinnati ohio together we are going to keep america great  we look forward to continuing our positive dialogue with china on a comprehensive trade deal and feel that the future between our two countries will be a very bright one during the talks the us will start on september 1st putting a small additional tariff of 10percent on the remaining 300 billion dollars of goods and products coming from china into our country this does not include the 250 billion dollars already tariffed at 25percent buy agricultural product from the us in large quantities but did not do so additionally my friend president xi said that he would stop the sale of fentanyl to the united states  this never happened and many americans continue to die trade talks are continuing and our representatives have just returned from china where they had constructive talks having to do with a future trade deal we thought we had a deal with china three months ago but sadly china decided to re-negotiate the deal prior to signing more recently china agreed to a string of court cases that have been run through the legal system that have hit dead ends    big rally tonight in cincinnati ohio see you there ps our country is doing great budget deal is phenomenal for our great military our vets and jobs jobs jobs two year deal gets us past the election go for it republicans there is always plenty of time to cut china iran  other foreign countries are looking at the democrat candidates and drooling over the small prospect that they could be dealing with them in the not too distant future they would be able to rip off our beloved usa like never before with president trump no way congratulations to kelly knight craft of  on her confirmation as united nations ambassador after having served so admirably as ambassador to canada  having done an outstanding job no matter how difficult the task kelly will be fantastic at the united nations winner it will soon be time to choose to keep and build upon that prosperity and success or let it go we are respected again all around the world keep it that way i said i will never let you down and i haven't we will only grow bigger better and stronger together the people on the stage tonight and last were not those that will either make america great again or keep america great our country now is breaking records in almost every category from stock market to military to unemployment we have prosperity  success like never before the cages for kids were built by the obama administration in 2014 he had the policy of child separation i ended it even as i realized that more families would then come to the border  experts stated that the fed should not have tightened and then waited too long to undo their mistake james bullard of st louis fed said they waited too long to correct the mistake that they made last december mistake powell cut rate and then he started talking  very low ratings for the democratic debate last night  they're desperate for trump thank you bill say hello to our great veterans  the radical left dems went after me for using the words drug-infested concerning baltimore take a look at elijah c  the 99percent get a bigger raise  as usual powell let us down but at least he is ending quantitative tightening which shouldn't have started in the first place no inflation we are winning anyway but i am certainly not getting much help from the federal reserve what the market wanted to hear from jay powell and the federal reserve was that this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive rate-cutting cycle which would keep pace with china the european union and other countries around the world i am very happy for eddie gallagher and his family to information that may have been obtained from opposing lawyers and for giving immunity in a totally incompetent fashion i have directed the secretary of the navy richard spencer  chief of naval operations john richardson to immediately withdraw and rescind the awards the prosecutors who lost the case against seal eddie gallagher who i released from solitary confinement so he could fight his case properly were ridiculously given a navy achievement medal not only did they lose the case they had difficulty with respect or is he too dumb stupid} to understand that no wonder cnn's ratings msnbc's also have gone down the tubes and will stay there until they bring credibility back to the newsroom don't hold your breath cnn's don lemon the dumbest man on television insinuated last night while asking a debate question that i was a racist when in fact i am the least racist person in the world perhaps someone should explain to don that he is supposed to be neutral unbiased  fair lowering drug prices for many americans including our great seniors at my direction   just released a safe importation action plan our governors will be very happy too    the lesser of two socialists is still a socialist senator john kennedy of louisiana if i hadn't won the 2016 election we would be in a great recession/depression right now the people i saw on stage last night  you can add in sleepy joe harris  the rest will lead us into an economic sinkhole the likes of which we have never seen before with me only up such a great victory in court yesterday on the russian hoax the greatest political scam in the history of our country treason hopefully the attorney generel of the united states and all of those working with him will find out in great detail what happened never again i have directed the secretary of the navy richard spencer and chief of naval operations john richardson to immediately withdraw and rescind the awards i am very happy for eddie gallagher and his family not only did they lose the case they had difficulty with respect to information that may have been obtained from opposing lawyers and for giving immunity in a totally incompetent fashion the prosecutors who lost the case against seal eddie gallagher who i released from solitary confinement so he could fight his case properly were ridiculously given a navy achievement medal vindication  exoneration from the russian wikileaks and every other form of hoax perpetrated by the dnc radical democrats and others this is really big stuff especially coming from a highly respected judge who was appointed by president clinton the witch hunt ends wow a federal judge in the southern district of ny completely dismissed a lawsuit brought by the democratic national committee against our historic 2016 campaign for president the judge said the dnc case was entirely divorced from the facts yet another total  complete thank you eric  thank you amy  we should immediately pass voter id  to insure the safety and sanctity of our voting system also paper ballots as backup old fashioned but true thank you great reception in jamestown by both republicans  democrats respect for our country's incredible heritage thank you heading to jamestown virginia word is the democrats will make it as uncomfortable as possible but that's ok because today is not about them don't watch show but heard mika said i asked to preside over their marriage not truedoes anyone really believe that they were married by elijah king of baltimore just reminded my staff that morning joe  psycho were with me in my room at their request the night i won new hampshire likewise followed me to other states china has lost 5 million jobs and two million manufacturing jobs due to the trump tariffs trumps got china back on its heels and the united states is doing great   senate is working hard on america's transportation infrastructure act will have big impact on our highways and roads all across our nation interest strong from republicans and democrats do i hear the beautiful word bipartisan get it done i am with you  wow morning joe  psycho ratings have really crashed very small audience people are tired of hearing fake news delivered with an anger that is not to be believed sad when the show was sane they helped get me elected thanks was on all the time lost all of its juice to ripoff the usa even bigger and better than ever before the problem with them waiting however is that if  when i win the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating nowor no deal at all we have all the cards our past leaders never got it my team is negotiating with them now but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit they should probably wait out our election to see if we get one of the democrat stiffs like sleepy joe then they could make a great deal like in past 30 years and continue china is doing very badly worst year in 27 was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now no signs that they are doing so that is the problem with china they just don't come through our economy has become much larger than the chinese economy is last 3 years despite the democrats wanting very unsafe open borders  refusing to change the loopholes  asylum tremendous progress is being made the the southern border we all waited because we assumed the dems would ultimately be forced to change the horrible immigration lawsthey didn't somali refugees arresed in tucson on way to egypt they were in touch with an agent posing as a terrorist one of them stated the best wake up call is islamic state to get victory or another 9/11 get smart people    rt    democrats are the only ones interfering in our elections 🤨 why do you think they so strongl i don't know what it's going to take a lot of democratic run cities all over america look like this it's not just baltimore unfortunately kimberly klacik baltimore journalist  remember vote for trump what the h do you have to lose best unemployment numbers baltimore's numbers are the worst in the united states on crime and the economy billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years but to no avail the money was stolen or wasted ask elijah cummings where it went he should investigate himself with his oversight committee elijah cummings never even went to the southern border and then he screams at the very good people who despite congresses failure to fix the loopholes and asylum make it work crossings are way down and the wall is being built even with zero dem help border getting strong she loves our military and our vets and protects our second amendment cindy has my full and total endorsement  senator cindy hyde-smith is doing a great job for the people of mississippi and fully supports our  agenda cindy is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration just remember the iranians never won a war but never lost a negotiation he is tough on crime strong on borders and will fight for our second amendment daniel will never let you down he has my full and complete endorsement the republican party has a new star his name is daniel cameron  and he is running for attorney general of the commonwealth of kentucky it is the 25th anniversary of a great organization run by people who truly love our country  on behalf of all americans i thank them   looking forward to my meeting at 2:00 pm with wonderful inner city pastors countries that know how to play the game against the us that's actually why the eu was formedand for china until now the us has been easy pickens the fed has made all of the wrong moves a small rate cut is not enough but we will win anyway the fed raised way too early and way too much their quantitative tightening was another big mistake while our country is doing very well the potential wealth creation that was missed especially when measured against our debt is staggering we are competing with other even to new heights of success and glory but not with king elijah and that crew when the leaders of baltimore want to see the city rise again i am in a very beautiful oval shaped office waiting for your call crazy bernie sanders recently equated the city of baltimore to a third world country based on that statement i assume that bernie must now be labeled a racist just as a republican would if he used that term and standard the fact is baltimore can be brought back maybe the eu and china will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product in the meantime and with very low inflation our fed does nothing and probably will do very little by comparison too bad al sharpton would always ask me to go to his events he would say it's a personal favor to me seldom but sometimes i would go it was fine he came to my office in tt during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me just a conman at work if the democrats are going to defend the radical left squad and king elijah's baltimore fail it will be a long road to 2020 the good news for the dems is that they have the fake news media in their pocket baltimore under the leadership of elijah cummings has the worst crime statistics in the nation 25 years of all talk no action so tired of listening to the same old bullnext reverend al will show up to complain  protest nothing will get done for the people in need sad i have known al for 25 years went to fights with him  don king always got along well he loved trump he would ask me for favors often al is a con man a troublemaker always looking for a score just doing his thing must have intimidated comcast/nbc hates whites  cops  good luck with the book george should do well  law enforcement is at the scene of shootings in gilroy california reports are that shooter has not yet been apprehended be careful and safe the democrats hate this president so much they're forgetting about their duty to secure our border    sad but true if the democrats would have closed the loopholes two years ago when president trump asked them to do so none of this stuff would have happened  be leaving office on august 15th i would like to thank dan for his great service to our country the acting director will be named shortly i am pleased to announce that highly respected congressman john ratcliffe of texas will be nominated by me to be the director of national intelligence a former us attorney john will lead and inspire greatness for the country he loves dan coats the current director will under the trump administration african american unemployment is the lowest best in the history of the united states no president has come close to doing this before i also created successful opportunity zones waiting for nancy and elijah to say thank you mr president if racist elijah cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district and baltimore itself perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership his radical oversight is a joke there is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know that elijah cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district and of baltimore itself dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts shame elijah cummings has had his chance to address it crime  conditions in baltimore for decades and he hasn't gotten it done    how can he get it done when he just wants to use his oversight committee to hurt innocent people and divide our country speaking of failing badly has anyone seen what is happening to nancy pelosi's district in san francisco it is not even recognizeable lately something must be done before it is too late the dems should stop wasting time on the witch hunt hoax and start focusing on our country a look the facts speak far louder than words the democrats always play the race card when in fact they have done so little for our nation's great african american people now lowest unemployment in us history and only getting better elijah cummings has failed badly someone please explain to nancy pelosi who was recently called racist by those in her own party that there is nothing wrong with bringing out the very obvious fact that congressman elijah cummings has done a very poor job for his district and the city of baltimore just take if it weren't for donald trump we would never know how corrupt these democrats are we would never know for sure that there was a deep state now we know it  rt  trump baltimore is a violent place highest homicide rate in usa /   civilian employee assaulted in stre the democrats are still doing the russians dirty work as they continue to push the fake crime media credibility is now shot democrat credibility is shot they've wasted over 100 hearings on a hoax they've done nothing on infrastructure drug prices trade the real collusion the conspiracy the crime was between the clinton campaign the dnc fusion gps christopher steeleand many others including comey mccabe lisa page and her lover ohr and his wonderful wife and on and on  so sad that elijah cummings has been able to do so little for the people of baltimore statistically baltimore ranks last in almost every major category cummings has done nothing but milk baltimore dry but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing robert mueller's testimony and the mueller report itself was a disaster for this illegal democrat inspired witch hunt it is an embarrassment to the usa that they don't know how to stop they can't help themselves they are totally lost they are clowns one of the biggest things to come out of mueller's testimony was the fact that when he was asked was there anything that impeded your investigation the answer was a clear unequivocal no misty marris    true but many other great exonerating things came out thank you   thank you   thanks     your district   why don't you focus on your district  no collusion no obstruction total exoneration democrat witch hunt we gave nadler and his trump hating dems the complete mueller report we didn't have to and even mueller himself but now that both were a total bust they say it wasn't good enough nothing will ever be good enough for them witch hunt elijah cummings spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through oversight he does nothing for his very poor very dangerous and very badly run district take a look   democrats don't care about border security they refuse to give the votes necessary to fix the loopholes and asylum would be so easy they want open borders which means crimecrimecrime such a big victory of our country supreme court approves trump administration plan to use military funds for the wall   we will be fully reimbursed for this expenditure over time by other countries the dems are now coming out of shock from the terrible mueller performance and are starting to spin impeachment all over again how sick  disgusting and bad for our country are they what they are doing is so wrong but they do it anyway dems have become the do nothing party the democrats were trying mightily to revive the badly  irrevocably tarnished witch hunt hoax until robert mueller put on the greatest display of ineptitude  incompetence that the halls of congress have ever seen truth is he had no facts on his side nothing he could do consideration is being given to declaring antifa the gutless radical left wack jobs who go around hitting only non-fighters people over the heads with baseball bats a major organization of terror along with ms-13  others would make it easier for police to do their job why is so much money sent to the elijah cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the united states no human being would want to live there where is all this money going how much is stolen investigate this corrupt mess immediately as proven last week during a congressional tour the border is clean efficient  well run just very crowded cumming district is a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess if he spent more time in baltimore maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous  filthy place rep elijah cummings has been a brutal bully shouting and screaming at the great men  women of border patrol about conditions at the southern border when actually his baltimore district is far worse and more dangerous his district is considered the worst in the usa wow big victory on the wall the united states supreme court overturns lower court injunction allows southern border wall to proceed big win for border security and the rule of law   puts guatemalan migrants on fast track home  the wto is broken when the world's richest countries claim to be developing countries to avoid wto rules and get special treatment no more today i directed the us trade representative to take action so that countries stop

investigation is rooted in nothing mueller was exposed as being best friends with comey today you say appreciate it  thank you  thank you    and  on  moments ago  the witch hunt is over   great job   thank you    thank you rep   thank you rep   thank you   thank you  mccarthy  the media's mueller meltdown   the democrats lost so big today their party is in shambles right now the democrats had nothing impeachment's over   even michael moore agrees that the dems and mueller blew it  the kind of questions the white house correspondents were asking is almost like they didn't see what went on at the hearings   the hearings were a disaster for robert mueller  the democrats nevertheless the fake news media will try to make the best out of it truth is a force of nature i would like to thank the democrats for holding this morning's hearing now after 3 hours robert mueller has to subject himself to  an embarrassment to our country mueller was asked whether or not the investigation was impeded in any way and he said no in other words there was no obstruction   this has been a disaster for the democrats and a disaster for the reputation of robert mueller chris wallace  interview including the vice president of the united states it has been reported that robert mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of fbi director and get turned down the day before he was wrongfully appointed special counsel hope he doesn't say that under oath in that we have numerous witnesses to the keep america great no collusion no obstruction interview including the vice president of the united states it has been reported that robert mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of fbi director and get turned down the day before he was wrongfully appointed special counsel hope he doesn't say that under oath in the we have numerous witnesses to the so why didn't the highly conflicted robert mueller investigate how and why crooked hillary clinton deleted and acid washed 33000 emails immediately after getting a subpoena from the united states congress she must have great lawyers why didn't robert mueller  his band of 18 angry democrats spend any time investigating crooked hillary clinton lyin'  leakin' james comey lisa page and her psycho lover peter s andy mccabe the beautiful ohr family fusion gps and many more  including himself  andrew w it was never agreed that robert mueller could use one of his many democrat never trumper lawyers to sit next to him and help him with his answers this was specifically not agreed to and i would never have agreed to it the greatest witch hunt in us history by far so democrats and others can illegally fabricate a crime try pinning it on a very innocent president and when he fights back against this illegal and treasonous attack on our country they call it obstruction wrong why didn't robert mueller investigate the investigators so robert mueller has now asked for his long time never trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers what's this all about his lawyer represented the basement server guy who got off free in the crooked hillary case this should not be allowed rigged witch hunt the young leaders here today  are part of a movement unlike anything in the history of our nation it is a movement about reclaiming your future rebuilding your country restoring your destiny and renewing the values that are the true source of american greatness  congratulations to our new secretary of defense mark   oh well we still have the great  who i hear has a really strong

because he polled at zero fox sure ain't what it used to be too bad just got back only to hear of a last minute change allowing a never trumper attorney to help robert mueller with his testimony before congress tomorrow what a disgrace to our system never heard of this before very unfair should not be allowed a rigged witch hunt budget deal gives great victories to our military and vets keeps out democrat poison pill riders republicans and democrats in congress need to act asap and support this deal i got to know him over his many years as chairman of the police athletic league for which he devoted so much time and energy bob morgenthau a legend will be greatly missed i was saddened to learn of the recent passing of bob morgenthau a truly great man bob served as a naval officer in world war ii was an extraordinary us attorney manhattan district attorney and always a warrior for our country that he loved so dearly leaving for turning point usa will be speaking to some of the greatest and smartest young people on the planet see you there when an old wall at the southern border that is crumbling and falling over built in an important section to keep out problems is replaced with a brand new 30 foot high steel and concrete wall the media says no new wall has been built fake news building lots of wall in 2016 i almost won minnesota in 2020 because of america hating anti-semite rep omar  the fact that minnesota is having its best economic year ever i will win the state we are going to be a nightmare to the president she say no aoc plus 3 are a nightmare for america tariffs remittance fees or all of the above guatemala has not been good big us taxpayer dollars going to them was cut off by me 9 months ago guatemala which has been forming caravans and sending large numbers of people some with criminal records to the united states has decided to break the deal they had with us on signing a necessary safe third agreement we were ready to go now we are looking at the ban farmers are starting to do great again after 15 years of a downward spiral the 16 billion dollar china replacement money didn't exactly hurt keep america great congratulations to boris johnson on becoming the new prime minister of the united kingdom he will be great best and newest military almost totally rebuilt from the depleted military i took over in history best va in history choice and much much more gee let's impeach the president the squad aoc plus 3 and other dems suffer from trump derangement syndrome crazy newest poll only 11percent in favor of starting ridiculous impeachment hearings well let's see we have the best economy in history the best employment numbers in history most people working in history highest stock market in history biggest tax and regulation cuts in history i completely read the entire mueller report and do you know what i concluded after reading both volume 1 and volume 2 there is no there there no there there we completely wasted everybody's time and taxpayer's money  i completely read the entire mueller report and do you know what i concluded after reading both volume 1 and volume 2 there is no there there no there there we completely wasted everybody's time and taxpayer's money  when we rip down and totally replace a badly broken and dilapidated barrier on the southern border something which cannot do the job the fake news media gives us zero credit for building a new wall we have replaced many miles of old barrier with powerful new walls this was a real compromise in order to give another big victory to our great military and vets i am pleased to announce that a deal has been struck with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell senate minority leader chuck schumer speaker of the house nancy pelosi and house minority leader kevin mccarthy on a two-year budget and debt ceiling with no poison pills the squad is a very racist group of troublemakers who are young inexperienced and not very smart they are pulling the once great democrat party far left and were against humanitarian aid at the borderand are now against ice and homeland security so bad for our country going with first lady to pay our respects to justice stevens leaving now the report of iran capturing cia spies is totally false zero truth just more lies and propaganda like their shot down drone put out by a religious regime that is badly failing and has no idea what to do their economy is dead and will get much worse iran is a total mess but the questions should be asked why were all of clinton's people given immunity and why were the text messages of peter s and his lover lisa page deleted and destroyed right after they left mueller and after we requested themthis is illegal highly conflicted robert mueller should not be given another bite at the apple in the end it will be bad for him and the phony democrats in congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous witch hunt result of the mueller report no collusion no obstruction fake news equals the enemy of the people the mainstream media is out of control they constantly lie and cheat in order to get their radical left democrat views out their for all to see it has never been this bad they have gone bonkers  no longer care what is right or wrong this large scale false reporting is sick except for those stated by me  reams of paper were never given to me it is a made up story meant to demean  belittle the post had no sources the facts remain the same that we have 4 radical left congresswomen who have said very bad things about israel  our country the amazon washington post front page story yesterday was total fake news they said advisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four congresswomen now really does that sound like me what advisors there were no talking points it is far more costly for the federal reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does in the future turn down very inexpensive in fact productive  to move now the fed raised  tightened far too much  too fast in other words they missed it big don't miss it again as we have done it could have been soooo much better interest rate costs should have been much lower  gdp  our country's wealth accumulation much higher such a waste of time  money also very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in with almost no inflation our country is needlessly being forced to pay a much higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided federal reserve in addition quantitative tightening is continuing making it harder for our country to compete as good thank you very much for revealing the incredible facts which the fake news media will never do    based on the comments made by senator schumer he must have seen how dangerous  bad for our country the border is it is not a manufactured crisis as the fake news media  their democrat partners tried to portray he said he wants to meet i will set up a meeting asap senator chuck schumer has finally gone to the southern border with some democrat senators this is a great thing nearby he missed a large group of illegal immigrants trying to enter the usa illegally they wildly  rushed border patrol some agents were badly injured most importantly you have led israel with a commitment to the values of democracy freedom and equal opportunity that both our nations cherish and share congratulations to bibi  on becoming the longest serving pm in the history of israel under your leadership israel has become a technology powerhouse and a world class economy i don't believe the four congresswomen are capable of loving our country they should apologize to america and israel for the horrible hateful things they have said they are destroying the democrat party but are weak  insecure people who can never destroy our great nation make america great again presidential harassment the washington post story about my speech in north carolina and tweet with its phony sources who do not exist is fake news the only thing people were talking about is the record setting crowd and the tremendous enthusiasm far greater than the democrats you'll see in 2020 big progress at the border but dems in congress must change the immigration laws for all to be good end the loopholes and much more the great state of west virginia is producing record setting numbers and doing really well when i became president it was practically shut down and closed for business not anymore i will help angel mom and great woman mary ann mendoza with twitter i know mary ann from the beginning and she should never be silenced she is a winner who has lost so much her child twitter if you're watching please do what you have to do now   economic numbers reach an all time high the best in our country's history great to be a part of something so good for so many our teams will be talking further and we agreed to speak again in the next 48 hours just had a very good call with  stefan löfven who assured me that american citizen a$ap rocky will be treated fairly likewise i assured him that a$ap was not a flight risk and offered to personally vouch for his bail or an alternative you can add 10percent or 15percent to this number economy doing better than ever before  thank you bill very nice  as you can see i did nothing to lead people on nor was i particularly happy with their chant just a very big and patriotic crowd they love the usa  rt  great news for texas in june's unemployment rates report  with the incompetent mayor of london you will never have safe streets  rt  how i wish we had such leadership in the uk don't like this country don't like what it gives you then leavetrump d rt  the  has made  a bold and binary decision are you going to choose socialists choose isis choose the just spoke to  about his friend a$ap rocky's incarceration i will be calling the very talented prime minister of sweden to see what we can do about helping a$ap rocky so many people would like to see this quickly resolved thank you   fed there is almost no inflation but it is no thanks to the federal reserve had they not acted so fast and so much we would be doing even better than we are doing right now this is our chance to build unparalleled wealth and success for the us growth which would greatly reduce percent debt don't blow it i like new york fed president john williams first statement much better than his second his first statement is 100percent correct in that the fed raised far too fast  too early also must stop with the crazy quantitative tightening we are in a world competition  winning big because of the faulty thought process we have going for us at the federal reserve we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically in other words our interest costs are much higher than other countries when they should be lower correct governor of the state did a good  job that may be true but she could not have done it without the tremendous economic success of our country  the turnaround that my administration has caused really nasty to me in his average iq columns kissed my a on the call phony he could not have been nicer or more respectful to your favorite president me then i saw the column he wrote trump will be re-elected won't he he

the amount given to texas  florida combined i know the people of puerto rico well and they are great but much of their leadership is corrupt  robbing the us government blind a lot of bad things are

opportunity yet all they want to do is go fishing the american people are tired of the never ending witch hunt they want results now they are destroying the democrat party i'm appalled that so many of our presidential candidates are falling all over themselves to try to agree with the four horsewomen of the apocalypse i'm entitled to say that they're wack jobs  louisiana senator john kennedy opinion they're americans now i'm entitled to my opinion  i just think they're left wing cranks they're the reason there are directions on a shampoo bottle  we should ignore them the squad has moved the democrat party substantially left and in america if you hate our country you are free to leave the simple fact of the matter is the four congresswomen think that america is wicked in its origins they think that america is even more wicked now that we are all racist and evil they're entitled to their visible members of the house democrats who are now wedded to this bitterness and hate the republican vote was 187-4 wow also this was the first time since 1984 that the speaker of the house was ruled out of order and broke the rules of the house quite a day so great to see how unified the republican party was on today's vote concerning statements i made about four democrat congresswomen if you really want to see statements look at the horrible things they said about our country israel and much more they are now the top most yesterday it was my great honor to host our third annual made in america showcase at the   looking forward to tomorrow night's rally in greenville north

now they are forever wedded to the democrat party see you in 2020 those tweets were not racist i don't have a racist bone in my body the so-called vote to be taken is a democrat con game republicans should not show weakness and fall into their trap this should be a vote on the filthy language statements and lies told by the democrat our country is free beautiful and very successful if you hate our country or if you are not happy here you can leave if you come after the president the country the flag he's going to defend himself what the squad doesn't like is that donald trump is enforcing the very laws that are on the books that were put there by congress jason chaffetz also buy jason's great new book power grab billionaire tech investor peter thiel believes google should be investigated for treason he accuses google of working with the chinese government   a great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone the trump administration will take a look shouting of the fword among many other terrible things and the petrified dems run for the hills why isn't the house voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said because they are the radical left and the democrats are afraid to take them on sad the democrat congresswomen have been spewing some of the most vile hateful and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the house or senate  yet they get a free pass and a big embrace from the democrat party horrible anti-israel anti-usa pro-terrorist  public the best economy in our lifetime  make america great again the obama administration built the cages not the trump administration democrats must give us the votes to change bad immigration laws the dems were trying to distance themselves from the four progressives but now they are forced to embrace them that means they are endorsing socialism hate of israel and the usa not good for the democrats detention facilities are not concentration camps america has never been stronger than it is now  rebuilt military highest stock market ever lowest unemployment and more people working than ever before keep america great they are anti-israel pro al-qaeda and comment on the 9/11 attack some people did something radical left democrats want open borders which means drugs crime human trafficking and much more we will never be a socialist or communist country if you are not happy here you can leave it is your choice and your choice alone this is about love for america certain people hate our country here we go with the fake polls just like what happened with the election against crooked hillary clinton abc nbc cnn   they all got it wrong on purpose suppression polls so early they will never learn to impeach president trump on day one make them the face of the future of the democrat party you will destroy the democrat party their policies will destroy our country    need i say more what does it mean for america to have free healthcare for illegal immigrants no criminalization of coming into our country see how that works for controlling immigration they talk about israel like they're a bunch of thugs not victims of the entire region they wanted they are anti-semitic they are anti-america we don't need to know anything about them personally talk about their policies i think they are american citizens who are duly elected that are running on an agenda that is disgusting that the american people will reject we all know that aoc and this crowd are a bunch of communists they hate israel they hate our own country they're calling the guards along our border the border patrol agents concentration camp guards they accuse people who support israel as doing it for the benjamin's if democrats want to unite around the foul language  racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular  unrepresentative congresswomen it will be interesting to see how it plays out i can tell you that they have made israel feel abandoned by the us when will the radical left congresswomen apologize to our country the people of israel and even to the office of the president for the foul language they have used and the terrible things they have said so many people are angry at them  their horrible  disgusting actions with the us and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place in the meantime we are receiving billions of dollars in tariffs from china with possibly much more to come these tariffs are paid for by china devaluing  pumping not by the us taxpayer china's 2nd quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than 27 years the united states tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave china for non-tariffed countries thousands of companies are leaving this is why china wants to make a deal we are doing great economically as a country number one despite the fed's antiquated policy on rates and tightening much room to grow and the many terrible things they say about the united states must not be allowed to go unchallenged if the democrat party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior then we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in 2020 so sad to see the democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our country and who in addition hate israel with a true and unbridled passion whenever confronted they call their adversaries including nancy pelosi racist their disgusting language think what it would be without the 3 year witch hunt and fake news media in partnership with the democrats  sorry can't let them into our country if too crowded tell them not to come to usa and tell the dems to fix the loopholes problem solved friday's tour showed vividly to politicians and the media how well run and clean the children's detention centers are great reviews failing  story was fake the adult single men areas were clean but crowded also loaded up with a big percentage of criminals rt   great video rt   at some point the light bulb comes on i hope there are more brandon's out there rt   frm zimbabwe i stand with pres trump so sick of cnn pundits haters thank you so nice but we are getting it done anyway  it is done these places need your help badly you can't leave fast enough i'm sure that nancy pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements and viciously telling the people of the united states the greatest and most powerful nation on earth how our government is to be run why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came then come back and show us how so interesting to see progressive democrat congresswomen who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe the worst most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world if they even have a functioning government at all now loudly a big risk of major flooding in large parts of louisiana and all across the gulf coast please be very careful 94percent approval rating in the republican party an all time high ronald reagan was 87percent thank you paul ryan almost killed the republican party weak ineffective  stupid are not exactly the qualities that republicans or the citizens of our country were looking for right now our spirit is at an all time high far better than the radical left dems you'll see next year house minority leader kevin mccarthy is a far superior leader than was lame duck speaker paul ryan tougher smarter and a far better fundraiser kevin is already closing in on 44 million dollars paul's final year numbers were according to breitbart abysmal people like this is one of the most horrible abuses of all those texts between gaga lovers would have told the whole story illegal deletion by mueller they gave us the insurance policy  andy mccabe is a major sleazebag among many other things he took massive amounts of money from crooked hillary reps for wife's campaign while hillary was under

the current deputy secretary alex acosta informed me this morning that he felt the constant drumbeat of press about a prosecution which took place under his watch more than 12 years ago was bad for the administration which he so strongly believes in and he graciously tendered his resignation wow  ratings have crashed lost all credibility great job by rush limbaugh on  if mexico produces which i think they will biggest part of deal with mexico has not yet been revealed china is similar except they devalue currency  subsidize companies to lessen effect of 25percent tariffs so far little effect to consumers companies will relocate to us companies to come to the usa and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we  stupidly lost 30percent of our auto business to mexico if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back and fast but very happy with the deal i made when you are the big piggy bank that other countries have been ripping off for years to a level that is not to be believed tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and  most importantly a powerful way to get  wins big no contest the great rush limbaugh will

didn't know how to win they gave me standing o's in the great state of wisconsin  booed him off the stage he promised me the wall  failed happening anyway paul ryan the failed vp candidate  former speaker of the house whose record of achievement was atrocious except during my first two years as president ultimately became a long running lame duck failure leaving his party in the lurch both as a fundraiser  leader do you believe this kind of bravery amazing drug seizure watch     each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our nation  you are challenging the media gatekeepers and the corporate censors to bring the facts straight to the american people together you reach more people than any television broadcast by far   and international we have only one real currency in the usa and it is stronger than ever both dependable and reliable it is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the world and it will always stay that way it is called the united states dollar similarly facebook libra's virtual currency will have little standing or dependability if facebook and other companies want to become a bank they must seek a new banking charter and become subject to all banking regulations just like other banks both national i am not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which are not money and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior including drug trade and other illegal activity to everyone on the gulf coast as you make preparations to protect your homes  loved ones from flooding  the coming storm it is imperative that you heed the directions of  state  local officials we are working closely w/ them please be prepared be careful  be safe today i am directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect the free speech rights of all americans we hope to see more transparency more accountability and more freedom   or a very nervous and skinny version of pocahontas 1/1024th as your president rather than what you have now so great looking and smart a true stable genius sorry to say that even social media would be driven out of business along with and finally the fake news media years or maybe 10 or 14 just kidding they will quickly go out of business for lack of credibility or approval from the public that's why they will all be endorsing me at some point one way or the other could you imagine having sleepy joe biden or alfred e newman the fake news is not as important or as powerful as social media they have lost tremendous credibility since that day in november 2016 that i came down the escalator with the person who was to become your future first lady when i ultimately leave office in six a big subject today at the white house social media summit will be the tremendous dishonesty bias discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies we will not let them get away with it much longer the fake news media will also be there but for a limited period so happy that i was able to keep sikorsky helicopter in the great state of pennsylvania keep america great dow just hit 27000 for first time ever it seems that the brits and the french and the germans are coming around to the idea that the iranians are up to no good   mexico is doing great at the border but china is letting us down in that they have not been buying the agricultural products from our great farmers that they said they would hopefully they will start soon will be a big and exciting day at the white house for social media conflicted and compromised mueller again he said he was done after his last 9 minute speech and that he had nothing more to say outside of the no collusion no obstruction report enough already go back to work i won unanimously the big emoluments case yesterday now the democrats have asked to see 12 more people who have already spent hours with robert mueller and spent a fortune on lawyers in so doing how many bites at the apple do they get before working on border loopholes and asylum they also want to interview the highly democrats had to quickly take down a tweet called kids in cages inhumane treatment at the border because the horrible picture used was from the obama years very embarrassing  and remember a bank that i did use years ago the now badly written about and maligned deutsche bank was then one of the largest and most prestigious banks in the world they wanted my business and so did many others the fake news media loves the narrative that i didn't use many banks because the banks didn't like me no i didn't use many banks because i didn't don't need their money old fashioned isn't it if i did it would have been very easy for me to get the number of people who are no longer looking for jobs but who are now seeing the opportunity for job growth you've got to give the president an a plus for that  thank you robert one of our great business leaders robert johnson bet i give the president a lot of credit for moving the economy in a positive direction that's benefiting a large number of americans i think the tax cuts clearly helped stimulate the economy overall if you look at the us economy and you look at months the lowest since 1972 the wall street journal editorial board a tale of two economies  nearly one million more blacks and two million more hispanics are employed than when barrack obama left office and minorities account for more than half of all new jobs created during the trump presidency unemployment among black women has hovered near 5percent for the last six the pledge of allegiance to our great country in st louis park minnesota is under siege that is why i am going to win the great state of minnesota in the 2020 election people are sick and tired of this stupidity and disloyalty to our wonderful usa or a very nervous and skinny version of pocahontas 1000/24th as your president rather than what you have now so great looking and smart a true stable genius sorry to say that even social media would be driven out of business along with and finally the fake news media years or maybe 10 or 14 just kidding they will quickly go

certain companies we will not let them get away with it much longer the fake news media will also be there but for a limited period the white house will be hosting a very big and very important social media summit today would i have become president without social media yes probably at its conclusion we will all go to the beautiful rose garden for a news conference on the census and citizenship rt  god-willing / jihadi-failing i am going to be alive to see trump in the white house boris in number 10netanyahu building thank you bill  thank you so much  thank you to lockheed martin one of the usa's truly great companies i was just informed by marillyn hewson ceo of lockheed martin of her decision to keep the sikorsky helicopter plant in coatesville pennsylvania open and humming we are very proud of pennsylvania and the people who work there congratulations to  of north carolina  on his great primary victory for the united states congress greg is tough on crime borders and loves our second amendment our military and our vets he has my complete and total endorsement today on this usmca day of action thousands of grassroots supporters are urging congress to pass the great bipartisan usmca usmca = more jobs for american workers more economic growth and more opportunity for our farmers ranchers and businesses   thank you robert johnson  my administration is taking groundbreaking action to bring new hope to millions of americans suffering from kidney disease today i signed an executive order advancing american kidney health serving and doing a great job as your president including accepting zero salary word just out that i won a big part of the deep state and democrat induced witch hunt unanimous decision in my favor from the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit on the ridiculous emoluments case i don't make money but lose a fortune for the honor of iran has long been secretly enriching in total violation of the terrible 150 billion dollar deal made by john kerry and the obama administration remember that deal was to expire in a short number of years sanctions will soon be increased substantially the dems witch hunt continues  done a great job of reducing crime in the african american community because more african americans are at work today trump is not a racist he's a businessman because he's a great businessman he's pushing for lives to be better michael brown ceo hydromatic tech our company has grown since trump has taken control of the white house  the presidency in the sense that we have better opportunities now to do what we've been wanting to do for quite some time and that is to create manufacturing jobs i believe that president trump has fbi's christopher steele fake story falls apart false intel  media contacts were flagged before fisa john solomon the hill  the reality is that this was a plot from the very beginning to frame trump   so now the obama appointed judge on the census case are you a citizen of the united states won't let the justice department use the lawyers  that it wants to use could this be a first more and more the radical left is using commerce to hurt their enemy they put out the name of a store brand or company and ask their so-called followers not to do business there they don't care who gets hurt but also don't understand that two can play that game to your favorite president me these people are vicious and totally crazed but remember there are far more great people deplorables in this country than bad do to them what they do to you fight for bernie marcus and home depot a truly great patriotic  charitable man bernie marcus the co-founder of home depot who at the age of 90 is coming under attack by the radical left democrats with one of their often used weapons they don't want people to shop at those great stores because he contributed why would kentucky ever think of giving up the most powerful position in congress the senate majority leader for a freshman senator with little power in what will hopefully be the minority party we need mitch in the senate to keep america great democrats are coming after our great kentucky senator mitch mcconnell with someone who compared my election to september 11th after a wonderful dinner at the  last night with the amir of qatar  it was my great honor to welcome him to the  this afternoon  healthcare obamacare to stay in place when it would have been replaced by something far better shows how incredibly important our upcoming 2020 election is i have long heard that the appointment of supreme court justices is a president's most important decision so true recent strained decisions by the united states supreme court some so simple as allowing the question are you a citizen of the united states on our very expensive census report or the even more strained decisions 2 allowing the world's most expensive  pathetic india has long had a field day putting tariffs on american products no longer acceptable food stamp participation hits 10 year low wow  with president trump at the helm not only is america getting great again but he's going to make our estuaries our rivers our water everything better the things he is doing and done are just helping america tremendously thank you to bruce hrobak  outrage is growing in the great state of minnesota where our patriots are now having to fight for the right to say the pledge of allegiance i will be fighting with you  i agree with the president the supreme court got it wrong there should be a question about citizenship on the census ag barr sees a pathway to add the citizenship question  steve doocy   working hard on something that should be so easy people are fed up and they are both only getting bigger better and strongerthank you mr president handled i told  how to do that deal but she went her own foolish way-was unable to get it done a disaster i don't know the ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool tell him the usa now has the best economy  military  anywhere in the world by far the wacky ambassador that the uk foisted upon the united states is not someone we are thrilled with a very stupid guy he should speak to his country and prime minister may about their failed brexit negotiation and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was very good numbers on the economy much potential for growth trade deals being negotiated or being set up for negotiation we have been treated very unfairly to put it mildly by other countries for many years but that is changing spoke to  kevin mccarthy about the earthquakes in california and informed him that we will be working very closely on emergency funding also spoke to governor  all working together thought of within the us we will no longer deal with him the good news for the wonderful united kingdom is that they will soon have a new prime minister while i thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent state visit last month it was the queen who i was most impressed with i have been very critical about the way the uk and prime minister theresa may handled brexit what a mess she and her representatives have created i told her how it should be done but she decided to go another way i do not know the ambassador but he is not liked or well brilliant constitutional lawyer dr john eastman said the special prosecutor mueller should have never been appointed in the first place the entire exercise was fundamentally illegal the witch hunt should never happen to another president of the us again a total scam  thank you ari  a massive crowd that fake news  some dems didn't want to report  cute  their lowest rated show watch the  weekend daytime anchors who are terrible go after her big time that's what they want but it sure is not what the audience wants impossible to believe that  has hired  the person fired by  after they tried to hide the bad facts  failed for giving crooked hillary clinton the questions to a debate something unimaginable now she is all over fox including shep smith by far a source of information ask the times what they paid for the boston globe  what they sold it for lost 15 billion dollars or their old headquarters building disaster or their unfunded liability  is changing fast but they forgot the people who got them there comcast nbc/msnbc trump haters who do whatever brian  steve tell them to do like cnn nbc is also way down in the ratings but  who failed in getting the very boring dem debates is now loading up with democrats  even using fake unsourced  as watching  weekend anchors is worse than watching low ratings fake news  or lyin' brian williams remember when he totally fabricated a war story trying to make himself into a hero  got fired a very dishonest journalist and the crew of degenerate we are building the wall now but the reason the badly needed wall wasn't approved in the republican controlled house and senate was that we had a very slim majority in the senate  needed 9 democrat votes they were totally unwilling to give wall votes to us want open borders brought up not them because the dems won't change the loopholes and asylum big media con job united states citizens first border patrol and others in law enforcement have been doing a great job we said there was a crisis the fake news  the dems said it was manufactured now all agree we were right but they always knew that they are crowded which we the fake news media in particular the failing  is writing phony and exaggerated accounts of the border detention centers first of all people should not be entering our country illegally only for us to then have to care for them we should be allowed to focus on  congratulations to the us women's soccer team on winning the world cup great and exciting play america is proud of you all last year was the first in 51 years where prescription drug prices actually went down but things have been and are being put in place that will drive them down substantially if dems would work with us in a bipartisan fashion we would get big results very fast sleepy joe biden just admitted he worked with segregationists and separately has already been very plain about the fact that he will be substantially raising everyone's taxes if he becomes president ridiculously all democrats want to substantially raise taxes joe biden is a reclamation project some things are just not salvageable china and other countries that ripped us off for years are begging for him he deserted our military our law enforcement and our healthcare added more debt than all other presidents combined won't win a wonderful man and great republican  great coach great guy  jerry will be getting the presidential medal of freedom well deserved  democrats must change the loophole  asylum laws but they probably won't they want open borders which means massive crime and drugs  our country is the envy of the world thank you mr president  as well as we are doing from the day after the great election when the market shot right up it could have been even better massive additional wealth would have been created  used very well our most difficult problem is not our competitors it is the federal reserve strong jobs report low inflation and other countries around the world doing anything possible to take advantage of the united states knowing that our federal reserve doesn't have a clue they raised rates too soon too often  tightened while others did just the opposite my deepest sympathies go out to the family and friends of great businessman and energy expert chris cline his wonderful daughter kameron and their friends on the tragic accident which took place in the bahamas the great people of west virginia will never forget them happy birthday to

clinton despite the fact that in the first debate they modulated the sound on me and got caught this crew looks somewhat easier than crooked but you never know mark levin has written a big number one bestselling book called conspicuously and accurately unfreedom of the press it is a great book that tells it like it is fake news and all keep this book number one texas will defend them  indemnify them against political harassment by new york state and governor cuomo so many people are leaving new york for texas and florida that it is totally under siege first new york taxes you too high then they sue you just to complete the job people are fleeing new york like never before if they own a business they are twice as likely to flee and if they are a victim of harassment by the ag of the

that  will soon be joining our campaign she feels so strongly about our country  its future we are setting records in so many ways  we will keep it going mercedes has done a fantastic job within the administration  i am so thankful that's right the trump foundation gave away 100percent plus with zero rent or expenses charged and has been being sued by cuomo and new york state for years another part of the political witch hunt just in case anyone is interested clinton foundation never even looked at new york businesses in search of anything at all they can find to make me look as bad as possible so on top of ridiculously high taxes my children and companies are spending a fortune on lawyers no wonder people and businesses are fleeing new york in record numbers more money than it had going on for years originally brought by crooked hillary's campaign chair ag eric schneiderman until forced to resign for abuse against women they never even looked at the disgusting clinton foundation now cuomo's ag is harassing all of my it is very hard and expensive to live in new york governor andrew cuomo uses his attorney general as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes they sue on everything always in search of a crime i even got sued on a foundation which took zero rent  expenses  gave away why president trump has to deal with north korea the way it is now he had to figure out what to do with the korea mess i think this is why the president deserves a lot of credit harry kazianis center for the national interest thank you in my opinion the president has done more good on the korean issue in the last year and a half than president obama did in eight years if you look at the strides they made during the obama years which advocated strategic patience-they stuck their head in the sand this is congratulations to prime minister abe of japan for hosting such a fantastic and well run g-20 there wasn't a thing that was missing or a mistake that was made perfect the people of japan must be very proud of their prime minister thank you to president moon of south korea for hosting the american delegation and me immediately following the very successful g-20 in japan while there it was great to call on chairman kim of north korea to have our very well covered meeting good things can happen for all congratulations to legislators in new jersey for not passing taxes that would have driven large numbers of high end taxpayers out of the state many were planning to leave  will now be staying new york  others should start changing their thought process on taxes fast

after a wonderful meeting with chairman kim jong un stood on the soil of north korea an important statement for all and a great honor the leaders of virtually every country that i met at the g-20 congratulated me on our great economy many countries are having difficulties on that score we have the best economy anywhere in the world with great  unlimited potential looking into the future the highly respected farm journal has just announced my approval rating with our great farmers at 74percent and that despite all of the fake  corrupt news that they are forced to endure farmers have been unfairly treated for many years and that is turning around fast i am in south korea now president moon and i have toasted our new trade deal a far better one for us than that which it replaced today i will visit with and speak to our troops and also go to the the dmz long planned my meeting with president moon went very well again with china as our relationship with them continues to be a very good

of agricultural product from our great farmers at the request of our high tech companies and president xi i agreed to allow chinese company huawei to buy product from them which will not impact our  national security importantly we have opened up negotiations i had a great meeting with president xi of china yesterday far better than expected i agreed not to increase the already existing tariffs that we charge china while we continue to negotiate china has agreed that during the negotiation they will begin purchasing large thank you   i am in south korea now president moon and i have toasted

hunt and the fake news media i am in japan at the g-20 representing our country well but i heard it was not a good day for sleepy joe or crazy bernie one is exhausted the other is nuts so what's the big deal the stock market went up massively from the day after i won the election all the way up to the day that i took office because of the enthusiasm for the fact that i was going to be president that big stock market increase must be credited to me if hillary won a big crash all democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare how about taking care of american citizens first that's the end of that race great to be back in japan for the  bipartisan humanitarian aid bill for the southern border just passed a great job done by all now we must work to get rid of the loopholes and fix asylum thank you also to mexico for the work being done on helping with illegal immigration a very big difference united states supreme court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter can anyone really believe that as a great country we are not able the ask whether or not someone is a citizen only in america seems totally ridiculous that our government and indeed country cannot ask a basic question of citizenship in a very expensive detailed and important census in this case for 2020 i have asked the lawyers if they can delay the census no matter how long until the thank you   thank you  real professionals    i look forward to speaking with prime minister modi about the fact that india for years having put very high tariffs against the united states just recently increased the tariffs even further this is unacceptable and the tariffs must be withdrawn just stopped in alaska and said hello to our great troops   and  should be ashamed of themselves for having such a horrible technical breakdown in the middle of the debate truly unprofessional and only worthy of a fake news organization which they are boring these flyers depict australia's policy on illegal immigration much can be learned   what now for those who denied a 'crisis' at the border  they came to me asking for help and i got criminal justice reform passed with help from both republicans and democrats many said that nobody but president trump could have done this all previous administrations failed please ask why they failed to the candidates ever since the passage of the super predator crime bill pushed hard by  together with bill and crooked hillary clinton which inflicted great pain on many but especially the african american community democrats have tried and failed to pass criminal justice reform for tonight's  be sure to follow      and  for rapid response fact checking and the truth   sorry i'm on air force one off to save the free world and all of the others who have leaked lied and did so many other terrible things how is it even possible that these people are not being brought forward because it is a rigged democrat con game and the fake and corrupt media loves every minute of it why aren't the democrats in the house calling comey brennan clapper page and her fbi lover whose invaluable phone records were illegally deleted crooked hillary podesta ohr and nellie the gps fusion characters christopher steele the dnc  their missing server the republican senate just passed bipartisan humanitarian assistance for our southern border 84-8 in addition to aid congress must close the catastrophic loopholes that are driving the crisis we must end incentives for smuggling children trafficking women and selling drugs no collusion no obstruction robert mueller said he was done after his last 9 minute news conference as later corrected now the dems want to  give it another try does it ever end according to fake news and low ratings  democrats say hearings could change impeachment debate that's because they have lost the impeachment debate 80percent say no and they are hoping that yet another do over after 2 1/2 years and $40000000 will turn things around i have been in office for many years the military is very important to me and at no time in my professional life has the us military been as strong as it is right now thank you  the democrats would save many lives if they would change our broken and very dangerous immigration laws it can be done instantly just departed for the  summit in osaka japan🇺🇸🇯🇵  the democrats should change the loopholes and asylum laws so lives will be saved at our southern border they said it was not a crisis

senator martha mcsally of arizona has done an outstanding job in dc and is fully supportive of our agenda  she is with us all the way iran's very ignorant and insulting statement put out today only shows that they do not understand reality any attack by iran on anything american will be met with great and overwhelming force in some areas overwhelming will mean obliteration no more john kerry  obama the wonderful iranian people are suffering and for no reason at all their leadership spends all of its money on terror and little on anything else the us has not forgotten iran's use of ied's  efp's bombs which killed 2000 americans and wounded many more iran leadership doesn't understand the words nice or compassion they never have sadly the thing they do understand is strength and power and the usa is by far the most powerful military force in the world with 15 trillion dollars invested over the last two years alone stock market is heading for one of the best months june in the history of our country thank you mr president rt  who thinks the debates just won't be the same without donna brazile working on them behind the scenes i am pleased to announce the launch of  this new platform will allow my campaign and other republicans to compete with the democrats money machine this has been a priority of mine and i'm pleased to share that it is up and running  think of what it could have been if the fed had gotten it right thousands of points higher on the dow and gdp in the 4's or even 5's now they stick like a stubborn child when we need rates cuts  easing to make up for what other countries are doing against us blew it despite a federal reserve that doesn't know what it is doing raised rates far too fast very low inflation other parts of world slowing lowering  easing  did large scale tightening $50 billion/month we are on course to have one of the best months of june in us history think of what it could have been if the fed had gotten it right thousands of points higher on the dow and gdp in the 4's or even 5's now they stick like a stubborn child when we need rates cuts  easing to make up for what other countries are doing against us blew it despite a federal reserve that doesn't know what it is doing raised rates far to fast very low inflation other parts of world slowing lowering  easing  did large scale tightening $50 billion/month we are on course to have one of the best months of june in us history a dangerous journey we don't even need to be there in that the us has just become by far the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world the us request for iran is very simple no nuclear weapons and no further sponsoring of terror china gets 91percent of its oil from the straight japan 62percent  many other countries likewise so why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries many years for zero compensation all of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been when our country had no debt and built everything from highways to the military with cash we had a big system of tariffs now we allow other countries to steal our wealth treasure and jobs but no more the usa is doing great with unlimited upside into the future wonderful church service at camp david thank you i want to give the democrats every last chance to quickly negotiate simple changes to asylum and loopholes this will fix the southern border together with the help that mexico is now giving us probably won't happen but worth a try two weeks and big deportation begins i never called the strike against iran back as people are incorrectly reporting i just stopped it from going forward at this time at the request of democrats i have delayed the illegal immigration removal process deportation for two weeks to see if the democrats and republicans can get together and work out a solution to the asylum and loophole problems at the southern border if not deportations start sanctions come off iran and they become a productive and prosperous nation again the sooner the better iran cannot have nuclear weapons under the terrible obama plan they would have been on their way to nuclear in a short number of years and existing verification is not acceptable we are putting major additional sanctions on iran on monday i look forward to the day that i am at camp david working on many things including iran we have a great economy tariffs have been very helpful both with respect to the huge dollars coming in  on helping to make good trade deals the dow heading to best june in 80 years stock market best june in 50 years thank you jessica  a great book  looking good we must win to keep america great  stock market is on track to have the best june in over 50 years thank you mr president  when people come into our country illegally they will be deported the people that ice will apprehend have already been ordered to be deported this means that they have run from the law and run from the courts these are people that are supposed to go back to their home country they broke the law by coming into the country  now by staying stock market is on track to have the best june in over 50 years thank you mr president  proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone i am in no hurry our military is rebuilt new  and ready to go by far the best in the world sanctions are biting  more added last night iran can never have nuclear weapons not against the usa and not against the world on monday they shot down an unmanned drone flying in international waters we were cocked  loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when i asked how many will die 150 people sir was the answer from a general 10 minutes before the strike i stopped it not death to america i terminated deal which was not even ratified by congress and imposed strong sanctions they are a much weakened nation today than at the beginning of my presidency when they were causing major problems throughout the middle east now they are bust president obama made a desperate and terrible deal with iran gave them 150 billion dollars plus i8 billion dollars in cash iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out gave them a free path to nuclear weapons and soon instead of saying thank you iran yelled this russia collusion hoax was perpetrated in part by people inside the government and in part by a compliant fake news media mollie hemingway     the facts are starting to pour out stay tuned just revealed that the failing and desperate new york times was feeding false stories about me  those associated with me to the fbi this shows the kind of unprecedented hatred i have been putting up with for years with this crooked newspaper is what they have done legal sp closes at record high  it was my great honor to host canadian prime minister  at the  today🇺🇸🇨🇦  iran made a very big mistake the president has a really good story to tell we have unemployment lower than we've seen in decades we have people who stopped looking for work coming back into the labor force we are in a record growth period michael steel  do you believe sp opens at record high since election day 2016 stocks up almost 50percent stocks gained 92 trillion dollars in value and more than 5000000 new jobs added to the economy  if our opponent had won there would have been a market crash plain and simple    congratulations to president lopez obrador  mexico voted to ratify the usmca today by a huge margin time for congress to do the same here just returning from orlando and doral miami florida and heading to the oval office where i will present the great economist dr arthur laffer with the presidential medal of freedom i will be interviewed live tonight by  on   9 pm enjoy asking hillary clinton why she deleted and acid washed her emails after getting a subpoena from congress anybody else would be in jail for that yet the dems refuse to even bring it up rigged house committee so sad that the democrats are putting wonderful hope hicks through hell for 3 years now after total exoneration by robert mueller  the mueller report they were unhappy with result so they want a do over very unfair  costly to her will it ever end why aren't they if i didn't have the phony witch hunt going on for 3 years and if the fake news media and their partner in crime the democrats would have played it straight i would be way up in the polls right now with our economy winning by 20 points but i'm winning anyway democrat congressional hearings are  33000 emails that hillary and her lawyer deleted and acid washed after getting a subpoena from congress that is real obstruction that the dems want no part of because their hearings are rigged and a disgrace to our country the dems are very unhappy with the mueller report so after almost 3 years they want a redo or do over this is extreme presidential harassment they gave crooked hillary's people complete immunity yet now they bring back hope hicks why aren't the dems looking at the thank you 🇺🇸  don't ever forget this election is about you it is about your family your future  the fate of your country we begin our campaign with the best record the best results the best agenda  the only positive vision for our country's future   in the ultimate act of moral cowardice not one democrat candidate for president not a single one has stood up to defend the incredible men and women of ice and border patrol they don't have the character the virtue or the spine   on no issue are democrats more extreme  and more depraved  than when it comes to border security the democrat agenda of open borders is morally reprehensible it is the great betrayal of the american middle class and our country as a whole   together we are breaking the most sacred rule in washington politics we are keeping our promises to the american people because my only special interest is you   thank you orlando florida join me live tonight in orlando florida at 8:00 pm eastern as we kickoff  enjoy departing for orlando florida with  melania  i thank pat for his outstanding service and will be naming secretary of the army mark esper to be the new acting secretary of defense i know mark and have no doubt he will do a fantastic job acting secretary of defense patrick shanahan who has done a wonderful job has decided not to go forward with his confirmation process so that he can devote more time to his family german dax way up due to stimulus remarks from mario draghi very unfair to the united states ecb officials see rate cut as primary tool for any new stimulus   had a very good telephone conversation with president xi of china we will be having an extended meeting next week at the g-20 in japan our respective teams will begin talks prior to our meeting the fake news doesn't report it but republican enthusiasm is at an all time   high look what is going on in orlando florida right now people have never seen anything like it unless you play a guitar going to be wild see you later european markets rose on comments unfair to us made today by mario d mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others only a few people showed up for the so-called impeachment rallies over the weekend the numbers were anemic no spirit no hope more importantly no collusion no obstruction wow  the state department said it has identified 30 security incidents involving current or former employees and their handling of crooked hillary clinton's emails   this is really big never admitted before highly classified material will the dems investigate this the story in the  about the us escalating attacks on russia's power grid is fake news and the failing new york times knows it they should immediately release their sources which if they exist at all which i doubt are phony times must be held fully accountable thousands of people are already lined up in orlando some two days before tomorrow nights big rally large screens and food trucks will be there for those that can't get into the 25000 capacity arena it will be a very exciting evening make america great again long before they get to our southern border guatemala is getting ready to sign a safe-third agreement the only ones who won't do anything are the democrats in congress they must vote to get rid of the loopholes and fix asylum if so border crisis will end quickly next week ice will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the united states they will be removed as fast as they come in mexico using their strong immigration laws is doing a very good job of stopping people  polls are always bad for me they were against crooked hillary also something weird going on at fox our polls show us leading in all 17 swing states for the record i didn't spend 30 hours with  but rather a tiny fraction of that more fake news   one size doesn't fit all i support west virginia schools keep up the great work  big jim justice  i am with you  iran to defy uranium stockpile limits only fake polls show us behind the motley crew we are looking really good but it is far too early to be focused on that much work to do make america great again big rally tomorrow night in orlando florida looks to be setting records we are building large movie screens outside to take care of everybody over 100000 requests our country is doing great far beyond what the haters  losers thought possible and it will only get better thank you mr prime minister a great honor  congratulations to gary woodland in winning the united states open golf championship fantastic playing great heart there will be more in gary's future rep alexandria ocasio-cortez i think we have a very real risk of losing the presidency to donald trump i agree and that is the only reason they play the impeach card which cannot be legally used almost 70percent in new poll say don't impeach so ridiculous to even be talking about this subject when all of the crimes were committed by the other side they can't win the election fairly if republicans ever did that to the democrats there would be all hell to pay it would be a scandal like no other when will the fake news media start asking democrats if they are ok with the hiring of christopher steele a foreign agent paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc to dig up dirt and write a phony dossier against the presidential candidate of the opposing party thank you pm  and the state of israel for this great honor🇺🇸🇮🇱  happy father's day to all including my worst and most vicious critics of which there are fewer and fewer this is a fantastic time to be an american keep america great news is that at the end of 6 years after america has been made great again and i leave the beautiful white house do you think the people would demand that i stay longer keep america great both of these horrible papers will quickly go out of business  be forever gone a poll should be done on which is the more dishonest and deceitful newspaper the failing new york times or the amazon lobbyist washington post they are both a disgrace to our country the enemy of the people but i just can't seem to figure out which is worse the good the first 2 1/2 years of his presidency including the fact that we have one of the best economies in the history of our country it is called earned media in any event enjoy the show misleading in that i personally spent only a small fraction of that time doing interviews i do have a few other things to do you know think i will do many more network interviews as i did in 2016 in order to get the word out that no president has done what i have in i enjoyed my interview with  on  so funny to watch the fake news media try to dissect  distort every word in as negative a way as possible it will be aired on sunday night at 8:00 pm and is called president trump 30 hours which is somewhat saying enough democrat voters want to hear the politicians talking about issues this is a huge distraction and will only help donald trump get elected   greatest president since ronald reagan said a counter-protester lehighvalleylive yesterday was the radical left democrats big impeachment day they worked so hard to make it something really big and special but had one problem almost nobody showed up the media admits low turnout for anti-trump rallies   all around the country people are congratulations to great guy pete hegseth and wonderful jenny cunningham on their engagement they will have a fantastic life together  so nice  more and more states want to do this but their governors and leaders don't have the courage to do so the politics will soon mandate however because people from california  all over the land are demanding that sanctuary cities be gone no illegals drugs or trafficking florida governor ron desantis just signed bill banning sanctuary cities in state  forcing all law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration authorities bill prohibits local gov't from enacting sanctuary policies that protect undocumented immigrants also not true anything goes with our corrupt news media today they will do or say whatever it takes with not even the slightest thought of consequence these are true cowards and without doubt the enemy of the people do you believe that the failing new york times just did a story stating that the united states is substantially increasing cyber attacks on russia this is a virtual act of treason by a once great paper so desperate for a story any story even if bad for our country the first 2 1/2 years of his presidency including the fact that we have one of the best economies in the history of our country it is called earned media in any event enjoy the show misleading in that i personally spent only a small fraction of that time doing interviews i do have a few other things to do you know think i will do many more network interviews as i did in 2016 in order to get the word out that no president has done what i have in i enjoyed my interview with  on  so funny to watch the fake news media try to dissect  distort every word in as negative a way as possible it will be aired on sunday night at 8:00 pm and is called president trump 30 hours which is somewhat he is a national disgrace who is destroying the city of london  the corrupt news media is totally out of control they have given up and don't even care anymore mainstream media has zero credibility total losers london needs a new mayor asap khan is a disaster will only get worse  thank you steve  family  the trump economy is setting records and has a long way up to gohowever if anyone but me takes over in 2020 i know the competition very well there will be a market crash the likes of which has not been seen before keep america great president trump to launch 2020 campaign in florida    tuesday will be a big crowd and big day all in for senator steve daines as he proposes an amendment for a strong ban on burning our american flag a no brainer despite the greatest presidential harassment of all time by people that are very dishonest and want to destroy our country we are doing great in the polls even better than in 2016 and will be packed at the tuesday announcement rally in orlando florida keep america great with over a 50percent approval rating at this point in his presidency analysts believe re-election in 2020 looks very promising   hey we have accomplished more than any president in the first 2 1/2 years why not the latest polls find 51percent of americans approve of president trump's job performance last month a democrat pollster said president trump's approval rating has been the most steady of any president in history  while pennsylvania is booming i don't want there to be even a little glitch in coatesville  every job counts i want lockhead to boom along with it just spoke to marillyn hewson ceo of  about continuing operations for the  in coatesville pennsylvania she will be taking it under advisement and will be  making a decision soon thank you  mitch mcconnell for understanding the democrats game of not playing it straight on the ridiculous witch hunt hoax in the senate cryin' chuck

states of america sad which he is a member when  took calls from another person also very successfully purporting to be a russian operative did he call the fbi or even think to call the fbi no the fact is that the phony witch hunt is a giant scam where democrats when senator  spoke at length and in great detail about extremely negative information on me with a talented entertainer purporting to

trump administration and republicans attack the trump administration this is campaigning by the dems attorney david bruno so true in the meantime they are getting no work done on drug pricing

house doesn't want to wait this is a common thread between all of the committees do whatever you unrelated to russia russia russia although the radical left doesn't use the name russia anymore since

all see you in florida someone should call obama up the obama administration spied on a rival presidential campaign using federal agencies i mean that seems like a headline to me   it will all start coming out and the witch hunt will end presidential harassment beautiful afternoon in iowa thank you to all of our nation's farmers may god bless you and may god bless america  trump administration gives final approval for year-round e15 use  today here in iowa we honor america's cherished farming heritage we salute your commitment to american energy independence  and we celebrate the bright future we are forging together powered by clean affordable american ethanol  on my way to iowa just heard nearly 1000 agriculture groups signed a letter urging congress to approve the usmca our patriot farmers  rural america have spoken now congress must do its job  support these great men and women by passing the bipartisan usmca trade agreement why did the democrats run if they didn't want to do things  good day in the stock market people have no idea the tremendous potential our country has for growth and many other things if mexico produces which i think they will biggest part of deal with mexico has not yet been revealed china is similar except they devalue currency and subsidize companies to lessen effect of 25percent tariff so far little effect to consumer companies will relocate to us companies to come to the usa and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30percent of our auto business to mexico if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back and pass but very happy with the deal i made maria dagan steve stuart v when you are the big piggy bank that other countries have been ripping off for years to a level that is not to be believed tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producers and  most importantly a powerful way to get this is because the euro and other currencies are devalued against the dollar putting the us at a big disadvantage the fed interest rate way too high added to ridiculous quantitative tightening they don't have a clue  the united states has very low inflation a beautiful thing this is because the euro and other currencies are devalued against the dollar putting the us at a big disadvantage the fed interest rate way to high added to ridiculous quantitative tightening they don't have a clue  rt  european landmarks have a question they desperately need answering how do you stop the tourists from coming  sad when you think about it but mexico right now is doing more for the united states at the border than the democrats in congress  presidential harassment investigation in the senate they can talk to john dean until the cows come home we're not doing anything in the senate regarding the mueller report we are going to harden our infrastructure against 2020  mueller has spoken he found no collusion between the trump campaign and the russians the bottom line is what the democrat house is doing is trying to destroy the trump presidency which has been a tremendous success and i can assure you that we're done with the mueller jerry nadler's trump bashing show is a bust headline new york post   the greatest witch hunt of all time continues all crimes were by the other side but the committee refuses to even take a look deleting 33000 emails is the real obstruction and much more new book just out the real deal my decade fighting battles and winning wars with trump is really wonderful it is written by two people who are very smart  know me well george sorial  damian bates as opposed to all the books where the author has no clue who i am enjoy  🇺🇸  despite the phony witch hunt we will continue to make america great again thank you  congratulations to the 2019 indianapolis 500 winner   and  🏆🏁  i have been briefed on the helicopter crash in new york city phenomenal job by our great first responders who are currently on the scene thank you for all you do 24/7/365 the trump administration stands ready should you need anything at all can't believe they are bringing in john dean the disgraced nixon white house counsel who is a paid cnn contributor no collusion no obstruction democrats just want a do-over which they'll never get thank you  and john eastman  when will the failing new york times admit that their front page story on the  the new mexico deal at the border is a fraud and nothing more than a badly reported hit job on me something that has been going on since the first day i announced for the presidency sick journalism we do not anticipate a problem with the vote but if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming tariffs will be reinstated we have fully signed and documented another very important part of the immigration and security deal with mexico one that the us has been asking about getting for many years it will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by mexico's legislative body now with our new deal mexico is doing more for the usa on illegal immigration than the democrats in fact the democrats are doing nothing they want open borderswhich means illigal immigration drugs and crime the failing  story on mexico and illegal immigration through our southern border has now been proven shockingly false and untrue bad reporting and the paper is embarrassed by it the only problem is that they knew it was fake news before it went out corrupt media no obstruction the dems were devastated after all this time and money spent $40000000 the mueller report was a disaster for them but they want a redo or do over they are even bringing in  sleazebag attorney john dean sorry no do overs go back to work for two years all the democrats talked about was the mueller report because they knew that it was loaded up with 13 angry democrat trump haters later increased to 18 but despite the bias when the report came out the findings were no collusion and facts that led to if president obama made the deals that i have made both at the border and for the economy the corrupt media would be hailing them as incredible  a national holiday would be immediately declared with me despite our record setting economy and all that i have done no credit twitter should let the banned conservative voices back onto their platform without restriction it's called freedom of speech remember you are making a giant mistake there is not we can always go back to our previous very profitable position of tariffs but i don't believe that will be necessary the failing   ratings challenged  will do anything possible to see our country fail they are truly the enemy of the people not mentioned in yesterday press release one in particular were agreed upon that will be announced at the appropriate time there is now going to be great cooperation between mexico  the usa something that didn't exist for decades however if for some unknown reason mexico was not being cooperative on the border in things we had or didn't have and now i have full confidence especially after speaking to their president yesterday that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done importantly some things another false report in the failing   we have been trying to get some of these border actions for a long time as have other administrations but were not able to get them or get them in full until our signed agreement with mexico additionally and for many years rt  next we get to watch the democrat civil war between the socialists and the establishment during the debates in a race to s rt  trump wins historic landslide electiondemocrats russia did ittrump sets economic recordsdemocrats obama di i know it is not at all presidential to hit back at the corrupt media or people who work for the corrupt media when they make false statements about me or the trump administration problem is if you don't hit back people believe the fake news is true so we'll hit back other than to know he was and is a total loser when he makes statements about me they are made up he knows nothing little  whose show like his previous shoebiz tries is a disaster has

lawsuits what are they thinking as our country is invaded by so many people illegals and things drugs that we do not want make america great again coyotes and illegal immigrants which they can do very easily or our many companies and jobs that have been foolishly allowed to move south of the border will be brought back into the united states through taxation tariffs america has had enough people
