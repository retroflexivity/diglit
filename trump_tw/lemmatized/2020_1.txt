looting stores call in our great national guard like they finally did thank you president trump last night in minneapolis is this what voters want with sleepy joe all dems the lamestream media is doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy as long as everybody understands what they are doing that they are fake news and truly bad people with a sick agenda we can easily work through them to greatness the united states of america will be designating antifa as a terrorist organization other democrat run cities and states should look at the total shutdown of radical left anarchists in minneapolis last night the national guard did a great job and should be used in other states before it is too late congratulations to our national guard for the great job they did immediately upon arriving in minneapolis minnesota last night the antifa led anarchists among others were shut down quickly should have been done by mayor on first night and there would have been no trouble let new york's finest be new york's finest there is nobody better but they must be allowed to do their job the national guard has been released in minneapolis to do the job that the democrat mayor couldn't do should have been used 2 days ago  there would not have been damage  police headquarters would not have been taken over  ruined great job by the national guard no games mn gov walz we estimate 80percent of the rioters are from out of state  via  hopefully a great successful and safe rocket launch lifting off soon     80percent of the rioters in minneapolis last night were from out of state they are harming businesses especially african american small businesses homes and the community of good hardworking minneapolis residents who want peace equality and to provide for their families much more disinformation coming out of cnn msdnc  and  by far than coming out of any foreign country even combined fake news is the enemy of the people crossing state lines to incite violence is a federal crime liberal governors and mayors must get much tougher or the federal government will step in and do what has to be done and that includes using the unlimited power of our military and many arrests thank you here we go again fake news  is blaming russia russia russia they are sick losers with very bad ratings ps can't blame china because they need the cash it's antifa and the radical left don't lay the blame on others mayor jacob frey of minneapolis will never be mistaken for the late great general douglas mcarthur or great fighter general george patton how come all of these places that defend so poorly are run by liberal democrats get tough and fight and arrest the bad ones strength these are organized groups that have nothing to do with george floyd sad the professionally managed so-called protesters at the white house had little to do with the memory of george floyd they were just there to cause trouble the  handled them easily tonight i understand is maga night at the white house they professionally managed so-called protesters at the white house had little to do with the memory of george floyd they were just there to cause trouble the  handled them easily tonight i understand is maga night at the white house they professionally managed so-called protesters at the white house had little to do with the memory of george floyd they were just their to cause trouble the  handled them easily tonight i understand is maga night at the white house good practice as you saw last night they were very cool  very professional never let it get out of hand thank you on the bad side the dc mayor  who is always looking for money  help wouldn't let the dc police get involved not their job nice have been greeted with the most vicious dogs and most ominous weapons i have ever seen that's when people would have been really badly hurt at least many secret service agents just waiting for action we put the young ones on the front line sir they love it and great job last night at the white house by the us  they were not only totally professional but very cool i was inside watched every move and couldn't have felt more safe they let the protesters scream  rant as much as they wanted but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line they would quickly come down on them hard didn't know what hit them the front line was replaced with fresh agents like magic big crowd professionally organized but nobody came close to breaching the fence if they had they would time for a change   it was spoken as a fact not as a statement it's very simple nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters and those looking to cause trouble on social media honor the memory of george floyd looting leads to shooting and that's why a man was shot and killed in minneapolis on wednesday night or look at what just happened in louisville with 7 people shot i don't want this to happen and that's what the expression put out last night means revoke 230 the national guard has arrived on the scene they are in minneapolis and fully prepared george floyd will not have died in vain respect his memory the national guard has been activated in minneapolis they have arrived on the seen george floyd will not have died in vain respect his memory china regulate twitter if they are going to start regulating free speech    well as they have just proven conclusively that's what they are doing repeal section 230 the president has been targeted by twitter   what about all of the lies and fraudulent statements made by adam schiff and so many others on the russian witch hunt plus plus plus what about china's propaganda who's mistakes no flags   twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies  propaganda being put out by china or the radical left democrat party they have targeted republicans conservatives  the president of the united states section 230 should be revoked by congress until then it will be regulated these thugs are dishonoring the memory of george floyd and i won't let that happen just spoke to governor tim walz and told him that the military is with him all the way any difficulty and we will assume control but when the looting starts the shooting starts thank you i can't stand back  watch this happen to a great american city minneapolis a total lack of leadership either the very weak radical left mayor jacob frey get his act together and bring the city under control or i will send in the national guard  get the job done right mail-in voting will lead to massive fraud and abuse it will also lead to the end of our great republican party we can never let this tragedy befall our nation big mail-in victory in texas court today congrats  ceo mark zuckerberg is today criticizing twitter we have a different

very sad and tragic death in minnesota of george floyd if the fisa bill is passed tonight on the house floor i will quickly veto it our country has just suffered through the greatest political crime in its history the massive abuse of fisa was a big part of it thank you to  and  for their hard work and leadership look forward to being back with you on saturday warrantless surveillance of americans is wrong twitter has now shown that everything we have been saying about them and their other compatriots is correct big action to follow the radical left lamestream media together with their partner the do nothing democrats are trying to spread a new narrative that president trump was slow in reacting to covid 19 wrong i was very fast even doing the ban on china long before anybody thought necessary psycho joe scarborough is rattled not only by his bad ratings but all of the things and facts that are coming out on the internet about opening a cold case he knows what is happening we pass 15000000 tests today by far the most in the world open safely we are acting as a police force not the fighting force that we are in afghanistan after 19 years it is time for them to police their own country bring our soldiers back home but closely watch what is going on and strike with a thunder like never before if necessary obamagate makes watergate look like small potatoes new papers make clear that the obama administration spied in an unprecedented manner on the trump campaign and beyond and even on the united states senate nobody would ever have believed that this level of illegality and corruption would be taking place in our beautiful usa we have informed both india and china that the united states is ready willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute thank you happen again just like we can't let large scale mail-in ballots take root in our country it would be a free for all on cheating forgery and the theft of ballots whoever cheated the most would win likewise social media clean up your act now republicans feel that social media platforms totally silence conservatives voices we will strongly regulate or close them down before we can ever allow this to happen we saw what they attempted to do and failed in 2016 we can't let a more sophisticated version of that former cbs reporter one of the first ‘to identify myself as a target of illegal spying under obama admin'  congratulations to author nick adams on the  publication of your new book trump and churchill defenders of western civilization certainly a great honor to be compared in any way to winston churchill   the failing  winner of  for its totally flawed coverage of the illegal russia witch hunt does its research as follows think of the absolute worst things you can say about donald j trump pretend there are sources and just say it return the pulitzers great news the boring but very nasty magazine the atlantic is rapidly failing going down the tubes and has just been forced to announce it is laying off at least 20percent of its staff in order to limp into the future this is a tough time to be in the fake news business twitter is completely stifling free speech and i as president will not allow it to happen  is now interfering in the 2020 presidential election they are saying my statement on mail-in ballots which will lead to massive corruption and fraud is incorrect based on fact-checking by fake news cnn and the amazon washington post i hope all republican house members vote no on fisa until such time as our country is able to determine how and why the greatest political criminal and subversive scandal in usa history took place a total double standard the only thing the dems have going for them is their very close relationship with the fake news lamestream media didn't obama whose administration has now been caught cold illegally spying on the trump campaign recently also get caught playing golf on a course in virginia despite his wife michelle urging people to stay home before and after his round in a major public service message how brilliant are our farmers thank you  real talent   one person lost to this invisible virus is too much it should have been stopped at its source china but i acted very quickly and made the right decisions many of the current political complainers thought at the time that i was moving far to fast like crazy nancy for all of the political hacks out there if i hadn't done my job well  early we would have lost 1 1/2 to 2 million people as opposed to the 100000 plus that looks like will be the number that's 15 to 20 times more than we will lose i shut down entry from china very early we made most governors look very good even great by getting them the ventilators unlimited testing and supplies all of which they should have had in their own stockpiles so they look great and i just keep rolling along doing great things and getting fake lamestream news stock market up big dow crosses 25000 sp 500 over 3000 states should open up asap the transition to greatness has started ahead of schedule there will be ups and downs but next year will be one of the best ever about whether or not joe could have done such a horrible thing maybe or maybe not but i find joe to be a total nut job and i knew him well far better than most so many unanswered  obvious questions but i won't bring them up now law enforcement eventually will the opening of a cold case against psycho joe scarborough was not a donald trump original thought this has been going on for years long before i joined the chorus in 2016 when joe  his wacky future ex-wife mika would endlessly interview me i would always be thinking the opening of a cold case against psycho joe scarborough

arena to a very high standard without even knowing if the democrat governor would allow the republican party to fully occupy the space plans are being i love the great state of north carolina so much

got caught plus many  really have you looked at the numbers lately  fake polling just like 2016 but worse what happened to general michael flynn a war hero should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the united states again does anybody really believe that roger stone a man whose house was raided early in the morning by 29 gun toting fbi agents with fake news  closely in toe was treated fairly how about the jury forewoman with her unannounced hatred  bias same scammers as general flynn despite reports to the contrary sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown as of today 2462 people have died there a much higher number than the neighboring countries of norway 207 finland 206 or denmark 443 the united states made the correct decision lyin' brian williams of msdnc  i must admit that lyin' brian williams is while dumber than hell quite a bit smarter than fake news  anchorman don lemon the dumbest man on television then you have psycho joe what ever happened to your girlfriend scarborough another of the low iq individuals lyin' brian williams of msdnc a concast scam company wouldn't know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter totally made up story he's a true dummy who was thrown off network news like a dog stay tuned just told that fake news  is falsely reporting that i was recently shouting at my campaign manager over made up nonsense actually he is doing a great job i never shouted at him been with me for years including the 2016 win  have no intention to do so just fake news  doesn't want to speak about their persecution of general michael flynn  why they got the story so wrong they along with others should pay a big price for what they have purposely done to this man  his family they won't even cover the big breaking news about this scam happy birthday to three time olympian and five term congressman  no i think amash would make a wonderful candidate especially since he is way behind in his district and has no chance of maintaining his congressional seat he almost always votes for the do nothing dems anyway i like him even more than jill stein  thank you    at least they admit it the failing    never correct their fake reporting  the only reason the us has reported one million cases of coronavirus is that our testing is sooo much better than any other country in the world other countries are way behind us in testing and therefore show far fewer cases thank you michael   thank you  and     but i love diamond  silk and so do millions of people  texas to open businesses in phases beginning friday great job being done by  many states moving to safely  quickly reopen we are doing far more and better testing than any other country in the world and yet the media does nothing but complain no matter how good a job is done the same as with the ventilators they will never say we are doing a great job they will only viciously gripe because shifty is a crooked politician  i will be having a white house press conference today at 5:30 pm thank you why should the people and taxpayers of america be bailing out poorly run states like illinois as example and cities in all cases democrat run and managed when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help i am open to discussing anything but just asking fake news the enemy of the people there has never been in the history of our country a more vicious or hostile lamestream media than there is right now even in the midst of a national emergency the invisible enemy blame the democrats for any lateness in your enhanced unemployment insurance i wanted the money to be paid directly they insisted it be paid by states for distribution i told them this would happen especially with many states which have old computers so true  american citizens we were long ahead of dems who were all against the ban  great  they are one of the worst in the news business total slime balls  they asked me to be at west point on june 13th  i will be there  laura just another fake news report  does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called noble not nobel prize is especially as it pertains to

media by far is sources say or officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity or anything similar which allows fake news to make up a phony quote from a person who doesn't even exist the american people should demand names them happy or even a little bit satisfied they were rude and nasty this is their political playbook and they will use it right up to the election on november 3rd they will not change because they feel that this is the only way they can win america will not be fooled example vp mike pence held a conference call yesterday with all democrat senators he gave them everything

the testing problem until now the changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis all red tape has been cut ready to go for decades the  looked at and studied  its testing system but did nothing about it it would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic but a pandemic would never happen they hoped president obama made changes that only

elizabeth warren to stay in the race she has zero chance of even coming close to winning but hurts bernie badly so much for their wonderful liberal friendship will he ever speak to her again she cost him massachusetts and came in third he shouldn't the democrat establishment came together and crushed bernie sanders again even the fact that elizabeth warren stayed in the race was devastating to bernie and allowed sleepy joe to unthinkably win massachusetts it was a perfect storm with many good states remaining for joe thank you california   thank you utah   but they really knew who was going to win  elizabeth pocahontas warren other than mini mike was the loser of the night she didn't even come close to winning her home state of massachusetts well now she can just sit back with her
