lords and cartels the tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals mexico has taken advantage of the united states for decades because of the dems our immigration laws are bad mexico makes a fortune from the us have for decades they can easily fix this problem time for them to finally do what must be done hard to believe that with the crisis on the border the dems won't do the quick and

russia that's all you heard at the beginning of this witch hunt hoaxand now russia has disappeared because i had nothing to do with russia helping me to get elected it was a crime that didn't exist so

trouble and a do-over if they try to impeach president trump who has done nothing wrong no collusion they will end up getting him re-elected  impeachment is for high crimes and misdemeanors there were no high crimes and misdemeanors except for those committed by the other side i am on air force one with the first lady heading to japan and looking forward to honoring on behalf of the united states his majesty the emperor of japan i will also be discussing trade and military with my friend prime minister  intelligence agencies were used against an american president      this should never happen to a president again dems are furious at robert mueller for his findings no collusion no obstruction now they should go back to work and legislate when is twitter going to allow the very popular conservative voices that it has so viciously shut down back into the open it is time wow cnn ratings are way down record lows people are getting tired of so many fake stories and anti-trump lies chris cuomo was rewarded for lowest morning ratings with a prime time spot which is failing badly and not helping the dumbest man on television don lemon 71percent of voters rate the economy as excellent or good the highest number in more than 18 years  pelosi stammers through news conference  nancy pelosi should not be out there doing the kinds of things she is doing she will diminish herself and her membership she cannot put a subject with a predicate in the same sentence what's going on  ed rollins     today's action will help ensure that all americans learn the truth about the events that occurred and the actions that were taken during the last presidential election and will restore confidence in our public institutions  during the 2016 presidential election the attorney general has also been delegated full and complete authority to declassify information pertaining to this investigation in accordance with the long-established standards for handling classified information today at the request and recommendation of the attorney general of the united states president donald j trump directed the intelligence community to quickly and fully cooperate with the attorney general's investigation into surveillance activities  poll a majority of americans want the democrats to stop investigating president trump the mueller report said very strongly no collusion which led to no obstruction the dems can't get over 2016 or the conclusive mueller findings they are now the do nothing party the us senate has just approved a 19 billion dollar disaster relief bill with my total approval great we will never forget our fallen heroes it was our great honor to be with you today   congratulations to prime minister  and his bjp party on their big election victory great things are in store for the us-india partnership with the return of pm modi at the helm i look forward to continuing our important work together  and  are monitoring the damaging storms and flooding in oklahoma listen to the warnings of your local officials and stay safe we are with you our hearts go out to the people of missouri as they woke up to assess the damage from storms you are strong and resilient and we are here to assist  when the democrats in congress refinish for the 5th time their fake work on their very disappointing mueller report finding they will have the time to get the real work of the people done move quickly i was extremely calm yesterday with my meeting with pelosi and schumer knowing that they would say i was raging which they always do along with their partner the fake news media well so many stories about the meeting use the rage narrative anyway fake  corrupt press rex tillerson a man who is dumb as a rock and totally ill prepared and ill equipped to be secretary of state made up a story he got fired that i was out-prepared by vladimir putin at a meeting in hamburg germany i don't think putin would agree look how the us is doing the democrats have become known as the do nothing party drug prices pre-existing conditions and our great vets all they are geared up to do six committees is squander time day after day trying to find anything which will be bad for me a pure fishing expedition like this never happened before  it should never happen again the democrats are getting nothing done in congress all of their effort is about a re-do of the mueller report which didn't turn out the way they wanted it is not possible for them to investigate and legislate at the same time their heart is not into infrastructure lower democrats don't want to fix the loopholes at the border they don't want to do anything open borders and crime zero is getting done with the democrats in charge of the house all they want to do is put the mueller report behind them and start all over again no do-overs in a letter to her house colleagues nancy pelosi said president trump had a temper tantrum for us all to see this is not true i was purposely very polite and calm much as i was minutes later with the press in the rose garden can be easily proven it is all such a lie i want to welcome you all to the  as we award our very bravest law enforcement officers and firefighters our nation's highest public safety award  the medal of valor democrat leadership is tearing the united states apart but i will continue to set records for the american people  and nancy thank you so much for your prayers i know you truly mean it in the meantime my administration is achieving things that have never been done before including unleashing perhaps the greatest economy in our country's history but they really want a do-over you can't investigate and legislate simultaneously it just doesn't work that way you can't go down two tracks at the same time let chuck nancy jerry adam and all of the rest finish playing their games so sad that nancy pelosi and chuck schumer will never be able to see or understand the great promise of our country they can continue the witch hunt which has already cost $40m and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in america or get back to work as i have long been saying and has now been proven out this is a witch hunt against the republican party and myself and it was the other side that caused the problem not us between russia and the trump campaign mr mcgahn can be forgiven for declining the honor of appearing in mr nadler's pseudo-impeachment drama wall street journal editorial boardtoday may 21 2019 he jerry nadler wants a show he wants to use mr mcgahn as a prop to spend three hours claiming that mr trump tried to obstruct the mueller investigation yet mr mueller wasn't obstructed in any way his copious report was released for all to see  there was no collusion the democrats are in danger of becoming irrelevant because of their decision to keep taking the country on wild goose chases they ought to start governing you know for a change  michael goodwin  everybody including me thought that when the 40 million dollar mueller report was released with no collusion and no obstruction of a crime caused by others that was the end but no the democrats want to keep it going in an effort to help them in 2020 bad for the country also tremendous work is being done on pure renovation fixing existing walls that are in bad condition and ineffective and bringing them to a very high standard much of the wall being built at the southern border is a complete demolition and rebuilding of old and worthless barriers with a brand new wall and footings problem is the haters say that is not a new wall but rather a renovation wrong and we must build where most needed without the illegal witch hunt my poll numbers especially because of our historically great economy would be at 65percent too bad the greatest hoax in american history presidential harassment the democrats are getting zero work done in congress all they are focused on is trying to prove the mueller report wrong the witch hunt after two years of an expensive and comprehensive witch hunt the democrats don't like the result and they want a do over in other words the witch hunt continues everything the democrats are asking me for is based on an illegally started investigation that failed for them especially when the mueller report came back with a no collusion finding now they say impeach president trump even though he did nothin wrong while they fish congratulations to governor  on winning the republican primary for governor tonight in the great state of kentucky matt you are doing a fantastic job great news for republicans fred keller has just won the hard fought for pennsylvania congressional contest in a landslide over 70percent of the vote thanks to the thousands who showed up for the rally last night congratulations to fred and his wonderful family john brennan on the mueller probe i don't know if i received bad information but i think i suspected that there was more than there actually was wow he admits he was wrong congress should go back to work on drug prices etc the democrats are on a fishing expedition wanting to interview the same people and see the same things as we just went through for two years with robert mueller and the 18 angry dems never happened to a president before never even happened to president obama after spending 40 million dollars reviewing 14 million pages of documents  interviewing 500 people with the total support of the white house the mueller report was a big disappointment to the democrats so they want a do over it doesn't work that way-so bad for our country shahira knight has done a wonderful job as my legislative affairs director at the white house she was outstanding for us and for our country will be a tremendous success in the private sector wow mark levin's new book opened at  it is great  keep it there for a long time  johnny we will miss you  you did a great job  at a conclusion of no collusion and no obstruction the dems were unhappy with the outcome of the $40m mueller report so now they want a do-over so even though i didn't have to do it with presidential privilege i allowed everyone to testify including white house counsel don mcgahn for over 30 hours to robert mueller and the 18 angry trump-hating democrats and they arrived i am pleased to announce my nomination of barbara barrett of arizona and former chairman of the aerospace corporation to be the next secretary of the air force she will be an outstanding secretary  pennsylvania don't forget to get out and vote today for republican fred keller for congress fred

iran will call us if and when they are ever ready in the meantime their economy continues to collapse very sad for the iranian people the fake news put out a typically false statement without any knowledge that the united states was trying to set up a negotiation with iran this is a false report on this cuban independence day we stand by the people of cuba in their quest for freedom democracy and prosperity the cuban regime must end its repression of cubans  venezuelans the united states will not stand idly by as cuba continues to subvert democracy in the americas looks like bernie sanders is history sleepy joe biden is pulling ahead and think about it i'm only here because of sleepy joe and the man who took him off the 1percent trash heap president o china wants sleepy joe badly why are the democrats not looking into all of the crimes committed by crooked hillary and the phony russia investigation they would get back their credibility jerry nadler schiff  would have a whole new future open to them perhaps they could even run for president we have a booming economy and working people are making gains that they haven't seen in decades  stuart varney  two tweets missing from last batch probably a twitter error no time for a redo only the dems get redos was very good and highly professional to deal with and if for any reason i didn't like them i would have gone elsewherethere was always plenty of money around and banks to choose from they would be very happy to take my money fake news now the new big story is that trump made a lot of money and buys everything for cash he doesn't need banks but where did he get all of that cash could it be russia no i built a great business and don't need banks but if i did they would be thereand deutschebank the mainstream media has never been as corrupt and deranged as it is today fake news is actually the biggest story of all and is the true enemy of the people that's why they refuse to cover the real russia hoax but the american people are wise to what is going on fashioned but true when you don't need or want money you don't need or want banks banks have always been available to me they want to make money fake media only says this to disparage and always uses unnamed sources because their sources don't even exist the failing new york times it will pass away when i leave office in 6 years and others of the fake news media keep writing phony stories about how i didn't use many banks because they didn't want to do business with me wrong it is because i didn't need money very old the

media should be ashamed of itself but the good news is that the usa is wise to your game of dishonesty and deception he would see that it was nevertheless strong on no collusion and ultimately no obstructionanyway how do you obstruct when there is no crime and in fact the crimes were committed by the other side justin is a loser who sadly plays right into our opponents hands never a fan of  a total lightweight who opposes me and some of our great republican ideas and policies just for the sake of getting his name out there through controversy if he actually read the biased mueller report

long before was common knowledge it would have been impossible for me to know this but if that was the case and with me being one of two people who would become president why was i not told so that i could make a change the fake news media is hurting our country with its fraudulent and highly inaccurate coverage of iran it is scattershot poorly sourced made up and dangerous at least iran doesn't know what to think which at this point may very well be a good thing will jerry nadler ever look into the fact that crooked hillary deleted and acid washed 33000 emails after getting a most powerful demand notice for them from congress my campaign for president was conclusively spied on nothing like this has ever happened in american politics a really bad situation treason means long jail

patriot farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now hopefully china will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product the best but if not your country will be making up the difference based on a very high china buy of the tremendous ground we have lost to china on trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the wto it will all happen and much faster than people think when the time is right we will make a deal with china my respect and friendship with president xi is unlimited but as i have told him many times before this must be a great deal for the united states or it just doesn't make any sense we have to be allowed to make up some billions of dollars and moving jobs back to the usa where they belong other countries are already negotiating with us because they don't want this to happen to them they must be a part of usa action this should have been done by our leaders many years ago enjoy we can make a deal with china tomorrow before their companies start leaving so as not to lose usa business but the last time we were close they wanted to renegotiate the deal no way we are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made will be taking in so that they will be more competitive for usa buyers we are now a much bigger economy than china and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 election we are the piggy bank that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of no more china buys much less from us than we buy from them by almost 500 billion dollars so we are in a fantastic position make your product at home in the usa and there is no tariff you can also buy from a non-tariffed country instead of china many companies are leaving china in one year tariffs have rebuilt our steel industry it is booming we placed a 25percent tariff on dumped steel from china  other countries and we now have a big and growing industry we had to save steel for our defense and auto industries both of which are coming back strong i met marine sgt john peck a quadruple amputee who has received a double arm transplant at walter reed in 2017 today it was my honor to welcome john hero to the oval with his wonderful wife jessica he also wrote a book that i highly recommend rebuilding sergeant peck  wishing former president jimmy carter a speedy recovery from his hip surgery earlier today he was in such good spirits when we spoke last month he will be fine great to welcome chairman shin from lotte group to the wh they just invested $31 billion into louisiana-biggest

this year congress needs to help us complete the world's largest intergovernmental watershed restoration project asap good for florida and good for the environment there will be nobody left in china to do business with very bad for china very good for usa but china has taken so advantage of the us for so many years that they are way ahead our presidents did not do the job therefore china should not retaliate-will only get worse completely avoided if you buy from a non-tariffed country or you buy the product inside the usa the best idea that's zero tariffs many tariffed companies will be leaving china for vietnam and other such countries in asia that's why china wants to make a deal so badly there is no reason for the us consumer to pay the tariffs which take effect on china today this has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the us 21 points by china because china subsidizes product to such a large degree also the tariffs can be democrat rep tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the holocaust she obviously has tremendous hatred of israel and the jewish people can you imagine what would happen if i ever said what she said and says bernie sanders the economy is doing well and i'm sure i don't have to give trump any credit i'm sure he'll take all the credit that he wants wrong bernie the economy is doing great and would have crashed if my opponent and yours crooked hillary clinton had ever won has anyone noticed that all the boston  have done is win since coming to the white house others also have done very well the white house visit is becoming the opposite of being on the cover of sports illustrated by the way the boston players were great guys the unexpectedly good first quarter 32percent gdp was greatly helped by tariffs from china some people just don't get it also congratulations to  on the great job you are doing and the big ratings jump thank you president trump thank you  great show this morning and congratulations on your number one by far rating well deserved i say openly to president xi  all of my many friends in china that china will be hurt very badly if you don't make a deal because companies will be forced to leave china for other countries too expensive to buy in china you had a great deal almost completed  you backed out there will be nobody left in china to do business with very bad for china very good for usa but china has taken so advantage of the us for so many years that they are way ahead our presidents did not do the job therefore china should not retaliate-will only get worse completely avoided if you by from a non-tariffed country or you buy the product inside the usa the best idea that's zero tariffs many tariffed companies will be leaving china for vietnam and other such countries in asia that's why china wants to make a deal so badly their is no reason for the us consumer to pay the tariffs which take effect on china today this has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the us 21 points by china because china subsidizes product to such a large degree also the tariffs can be information as long as president trump is president his opposition will use every tool and misuse every tool available to make his life miserable     sadly this proves i am doing a great job also best economy and employment numbers ever it's the attack strategy of harass this is not about the attorney general who is very sophisticated  knows it isn't about him it's about trying to destroy president trump through an assault on his ag for upholding the rule of law he released a massive amount of overthrow the president through an illegal coup recommended by previous doj   and the democrat national committee-the democrat party apparatus-has been caught using donor dollars to collude with russian intelligence to attack a domestic political opponent me the fbi has no leadership the director is protecting the same gangthat tried to just another abuse of power in a long series of abuses of power by the democrats that began during the obama administration continued through the mueller fbi operation  now the baton has been passed to jerry nadler to continue to abuse power to harass president trump even director james clapper admits that the fbi actions against the trump presidential campaign do in fact meet the definition of spying perhaps fbi director christopher wray will be the next to do so  china is dreaming that sleepy joe biden or any of the others gets elected in 2020 they love ripping off america the constitutional crisis is the democrats refusing to work let them start by fixing the mess that their immigration laws have caused at the southern border when the mueller report came out showing no collusion with russia of course it was supposed to be over back to work for the people but the dems have gone nuts and it has actually gotten worse hope the republicans win back the house in 2020 or little will get done ever since the mueller report showed no collusion  no obstruction the dems have been working overtime to damage me and the republican party by issuing over 80 demands for documents and testimonies and with no reason that's all they want to do don't care about anything else despite two years and millions of dollars spent the democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the mueller report were made public but they knew there was nothing even before the report was started it is all a big hoax the biggest in american history employment numbers ever low taxes  regulations a rebuilt military  va many great new judges  so much more but we have had a giant scam perpetrated upon our nation a witch hunt a treasonous hoax that is the constitutional crisis  hopefully guilty people will pay the democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a constitutional crisis they and their partner the fake news media are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible they are a sad joke we may have the strongest economy in our history best we will then spend match or better the money that china may no longer be spending with our great patriot farmers agriculture which is a small percentage of total tariffs received and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world great  we are right where we want to be with china remember they broke the deal with us  tried to renegotiate we will be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from china buyers of product can make it themselves in the usa ideal or buy it from non-tariffed countries really sad  big attacks on republicans and conservatives by social media not good hoax my campaign was being seriously spied upon by intel agencies and the democrats this never happened before in american history and it all turned out to be a total scam a witch hunt that yielded no collusion no obstruction this must never be allowed to happen again think of it i became president of the united states in one of the most hard fought and consequential elections in the history of our great nation from long before i ever took office i was under a sick  unlawful investigation concerning what has become known as the russian president who is willing to have the battle and we have a great attorney general who is willing to lead the battle and they are going to get to the bottom of it    the democrats have nothing just want to distract from this president the fbi was not doing its job the state department was covering things up everyday for hillary at the end of the day they're fearful of what they did and should be fearful this is a tough rt   discusses what she wrote about in her column today re how very powerful people in dc are panicking because ag i was not going to fire bob mueller and did not fire bob mueller in fact he was allowed to finish his report with unprecedented help from the trump administration actually lawyer don mcgahn had a much better chance of being fired than mueller never a big fan the only problem is that they know i am going to win best economy  employment numbers in us history  much more and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term would be wise for them to act now but love collecting big tariffs i think that china felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election 2020 to see if they could get lucky  have a democrat win in which case they would continue to rip-off the usa for $500 billion a year so now the radical left dems don't talk about collusion anymore because the mueller report said there was no collusion they only want to talk about obstruction even though there was no obstruction or no crime except for the crimes committed by the other side i won the 2016 election partially based on no tax returns while i am under audit which i still am and the voters didn't care now the radical left democrats want to again relitigate this matter make it a part of the 2020 election such an easy way to avoid tariffs make or produce your goods and products in the good old usa it's very simple rt  trump economy vs obama economymanufacturing jobs created:trump 470000obama -206000under obama unemployment decli rt   today twitter crossed the line  suspended

honor our nation's military spouses and express our deep appreciation for all that they do  into the future will continue in the meantime the united states has imposed tariffs on china which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations over the course of the past two days the united states and china have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries the relationship between president xi and myself remains a very strong one and conversations great republican vote today on disaster relief bill we will now work out a bipartisan solution that gets relief for our great states and farmers thank you to all get me a bill that i can quickly sign we have been engaged in an unfair relationship with

slow down and we would automatically speed up build your products in the united states and there are no tariffs the average 401k balance has soared since the bottom of the market 466percent wow tariffs will make our country much stronger not weaker just sit back and watch in the meantime china should not renegotiate deals with the us at the last minute this is not the obama administration or the administration of sleepy joe who let china get away with murder tariffs will bring in far more wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind also much easier  quicker to do our farmers will do better faster and starving nations can now be helped waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source talks with china continue in a very congenial manner there is absolutely no need to rush as tariffs are now being paid to the united states by china of 25percent on 250 billion dollars worth of goods  products these massive payments go directly to the treasury of the us agricultural products from our great farmers in larger amounts than china ever did and ship it to poor  starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance in the meantime we will continue to negotiate with china in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal the process has begun to place additional tariffs at 25percent on the remaining 325 billion dollars the us

to happen china has just informed us that they vice-premier are now coming to the us to make a deal we'll see but i am very happy with over $100 billion a year in tariffs filling us coffersgreat for us not good for china the reason for the china pullback  attempted renegotiation of the trade deal is the sincere hope that they will be able to negotiate with joe biden or one of the very weak democrats and thereby continue to ripoff the united states $500 billion a year for years to come you would get it by building or even buying you always wanted to show losses for tax purposesalmost all real estate developers did and often re-negotiate with banks it was sport additionally the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate fake news hit job real estate developers in the 1980's  1990's more than 30 years ago were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would if one was actively building show losses and tax losses in almost all cases much was non monetary

more money by congress for hurricane disaster relief 91 billion dollars than any state in the history of the us as an example florida got $12 billion  texas $39 billion for their monster hurricanes now the democrats are saying no relief to scott walker is 100percent correct when he says that the republicans must wake up to the democrats state by state power grab they play very dirty actually like never before don't allow them to get away with what they are doing the united states has been losing for many years 600 to 800 billion dollars a year on trade with china we lose 500 billion dollars sorry we're not going to be doing that anymore also there are no high crimes  misdemeanors no collusion no conspiracy no obstruction all the crimes are on the other side and that's what the dems should be looking at but they won't nevertheless the tables are turning democrat texas congressman al green says impeachment is the only thing that can prevent president trump from re-election in 2020   in other words dems can't win the election fairly you can't impeach a president for creating the best economy in our country's history the witch hunt is over but we will never forget make america great again despite the tremendous success that i have had as president including perhaps the greatest economy and most successful first two years of any president in history they have stolen two years of my our presidency collusion delusion that we will never be able to get back to the gazan people  these terrorist acts against israel will bring you nothing but more misery end the violence and work towards peace it can happen once again israel faces a barrage of deadly rocket attacks by terrorist groups hamas and islamic jihad we support israel 100percent in its defense of its citizens pending the confirmation of mark morgan as our nation's new ice director matt albence will serve in the role of acting director matt is tough and dedicated and has my full support to deploy ice to the maximum extent of the law  this is not congressional oversight this is bullying jason riley the wall street journal the report sounded an awful lot as being comeyesque in other words i'm not going to charge this person there wasn't even close to being a crime but i'm going to criticize him on the way out the door that's unfortunate because it's stepping outside of the role robert ray to testify are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong no collusion conclusion there was no crime except on the other side incredibly not covered in the report and no obstruction bob mueller should not testify no redos for the dems after spending more than $35000000 over a two year period interviewing 500 people using 18 trump hating angry democrats  49 fbi agents all culminating in a more than 400 page report showing no collusion why would the democrats in congress now need robert mueller of additional goods sent to us by china remain untaxed but will be shortly at a rate of 25percent the tariffs paid to the usa have had little impact on product cost mostly borne by china the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate no for 10 months china has been paying tariffs to the usa of 25percent on 50 billion dollars of high tech and 10percent on 200 billion dollars of other goods these payments are partially responsible for our great economic results the 10percent will go up to 25percent on friday 325 billions dollars the kentucky derby decision was not a good one it was a rough  tumble race on a wet and sloppy track actually a beautiful thing to watch only in these days of political correctness could such an overturn occur the best horse did not win the kentucky derby not even close i am pleased to inform all of

and american patriot he will do a great job the witch hunt is over but we will never forget make america great again despite the tremendous success that i have had as president including perhaps the greatest economy and most successful first two years of any president in history they have stollen two years of my our presidency collusion delusion that we will never be able to get back mike has been a fantastic senator  the kentuky derby decision was not a good one it was a rough and tumble race on a wet and sloppy track actually a beautiful thing to watch only in these days of political correctness could such an overturn occur the best horse did not win the kentucky derby not even close how can it be possible that james woods and many others a strong but responsible conservative voice is banned from twitter social media  fake news media together with their partner the democrat party have no idea the problems they are causing for themselves very unfair today may 4th is

  very good call yesterday with president putin of russia tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with russia despite what you read and see in the fake news media look how they have misled

north korea  will do nothing to interfere or end it he also knows that i am with him  does not want to break his promise to me deal will happen when will the radical left wing media apologize to me

about a usa infrastructure plan especially when our great country has spent an astounding 7 trillion dollars in the middle east over the last 19 years but i am looking hard at a bipartisan plan of 1

immigration border infrastructure much lower drug prices  much more and do it now ok so after two years of hard work and each party trying their best to make the other party look as bad as possible

to wage a successful primary campaign it will be nasty you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick  demented ideas but if you make it i will see you at the starting gate despite the fact that the mueller report was composed by trump haters and angry democrats who had unlimited funds and human resources the end result was no collusion no obstruction amazing mueller was not fired and was respectfully allowed to finish his work on what i and many others say was an illegal investigation there was no crime headed by a trump hater who was highly conflicted and a group of 18 very angry democrats drain the swamp as has been incorrectly reported by the fake news media i never told then white house counsel don mcgahn to fire robert mueller even though i had the legal right to do so if i wanted to fire mueller i didn't need mcgahn to do it i could have done it myself nevertheless the great state of tennessee is so close to passing school choice all of our nation's children regardless of background deserve a shot at achieving the american dream time to get this done so important  of the great state of utah has written a wonderful new book entitled our lost declaration

call bob costa of the washington post he called me returned his call  just more fake news congress has no time to legislate they only want to continue the witch hunt which i have already won they should start looking at the criminals who are already very well known to all this was a rigged system we will drain the swamp no collusion no obstruction there has never been a president who has been more transparent millions of pages of documents were given to the mueller angry dems plus i allowed everyone to testify including wh counsel i didn't have to do this but now they want more can anyone comprehend what a great job border patrol and law enforcement is doing on our southern border so far this year they have apprehended 418000 plus illegal immigrants way up from last year mexico is doing very little for us dems in congress must act now are there no high crimes and misdemeanors there are no crimes by me at all all of the crimes were committed by crooked hillary the dems the dnc and dirty cops and we caught them in the act we waited for mueller and won so now the dems look to congress as last hope the mueller report despite being written by angry democrats and trump haters and with unlimited money behind it $35000000 didn't lay a glove on me i did nothing wrong if the partisan dems ever tried to impeach i would first head to the us supreme court not only mexico's soldiers recently pulled guns on our national guard soldiers probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the border better not happen again we are now sending armed soldiers to the border mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending  returning a very big caravan of over 20000 people started up through mexico it has been reduced in size by mexico but is still coming mexico must apprehend the remainder or we will be forced to close that section of the border  call up the military the coyotes  cartels have weapons the american people deserve to know who is in this country yesterday the supreme court took up the census citizenship question a really big deal make america great again former cia analyst larry johnson accuses united kingdom intelligence of helping obama administration spy on the 2016 trump presidential campaign  wow it is now just a question of time before the truth comes out and when it does it will be a beauty rep occasio-cortez is correct the va

veterans of america thanks rush   you mean the stock market hit an all-time record high today and they're actually talking impeachment will i ever be given credit for anything by the fake news media

keeping an open dialogue  i will be in green bay wisconsin this saturday april 27th at the resch center  7:00pm cdt big crowd expected   great golf champion  friend ernie els  has done a tremendous job in assisting those w/ autism through his els for autism fdn focusing on education research global outreach recreation services therapy services  adult services  great interview by jared nice to have extraordinarily smart people serving our country  keep america great the wall is being rapidly built the economy is great our country is respected again but should be much higher than that if twitter wasn't playing their political games no wonder congress wants to get involved and they should must be more and fairer companies to get out the word the best thing ever to happen to twitter is donald trump   so true but they don't treat me well as a republican very discriminatory hard for people to sign on constantly taking people off list big complaints from many people different names-over 100 m harley davidson has struggled with tariffs with the eu currently paying 31percent they've had to move production overseas to try and offset some of that tariff that they've been hit with which will rise to 66percent in june of 2021  so unfair to us we will reciprocate dumb and sick a really bad show with low ratings and will only get worse cnn has been a proven and long term ratings and beyond disaster in fact it rewarded chris cuomo with a now unsuccessful prime time slot despite his massive failure in the morning only on cnn sorry to say but  is by far the best of the morning political shows on television it rightfully has by far the highest  ratings not even close morning psycho joe who helped get me elected in 2016 by having me on free all the time has nosedived too angry in the old days if you were president and you had a good economy you were basically immune from criticism remember it's the economy stupid today i have as president perhaps the greatest economy in historyand to the mainstream media it means nothing but it will the radical left democrats together with their leaders in the fake news media have gone totally insane i guess that means that the republican agenda is working stay tuned for more i will be going to green bay wisconsin for a really big rally on saturday evening big crowd expected much to talk about make america great again i wonder if the new york times will apologize to me a second time as they did after the 2016 election but this one will have to be a far bigger   better apology on this one they will have to get down on their knees  beg for forgiveness-they are truly the enemy of the people paul krugman of the fake news new york times has lost all credibility as has the times itself with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me he is obsessed with hatred just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is he said market would crash only record highs presidential harassment  this should never happen to another president again  just spoke to  will be doing a very interesting show tonight at 7:00 pm eastern on  today  melania and i are honored to host the 2019  easter egg roll  isn't it amazing that the people who were closest to me by far and knew the campaign better than anyone were never even called to testify before mueller the reason is that the 18 angry democrats knew they would all say ‘no collusion' and only very good things a very exculpatory section of the mueller report no conspiracy coordination or collusion with the trump campaign and the russians you can't be more clear than that   the obama administration did not do itself proud in this   southern border crisis   spoke to the prime minister of italy giuseppe conte mostly concerning immigration taxes trade and the economy of both of our countries very good call spoke to prime minister ranil wickremesinghe of sri lanka this morning to inform him that the united states stands by him and his country in the fight against terrorism also expressed condolences on behalf of myself and the people of the united states my friend herman cain a truly wonderful man has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the federal reserve board i will respect his wishes herman is a great american who truly loves our country congratulations  thank you    only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment there were no crimes by me no collusion no obstruction so you can't impeach it was the democrats that committed the crimes not your republican president tables are finally turning on the witch hunt saudi arabia and others in opec will more than make up the oil flow difference in our now full sanctions on iranian oil iran is being given very bad advice by  and people who helped him lead the us into the very bad iran nuclear deal big violation of logan act so true thanks    spoke to president maithripala sirisena of sri lanka yesterday to inform him that the united states stands by him and his country in the fight against terrorism also expressed condolences on behalf of myself and the people of the united states how do you impeach a republican president for a crime that was committed by the democrats make america great again can you believe that i had to go through the worst and most corrupt political witch hunt in the history of the united states no collusion when it was the other side that illegally created the diversionary  criminal event and even spied on my campaign disgraceful jobless claims in the united states have reached their lowest best level in over 50 years despite no collusion no obstruction the radical left democrats do not want to go on to legislate for the good of the people but only to investigate and waste time this is costing our country greatly and will cost the dems big time in 2020 the trump haters and angry democrats who wrote the mueller report were devastated by the no collusion finding nothing but a total hit job which should never have been allowed to start in the first place do you believe this the new york times op-ed media and democrats owe trump an apology well they got that one right 138 people have been killed in sri lanka with more that 600 badly injured in a terrorist attack on churches and hotels the united states offers heartfelt condolences to the great people of sri lanka we stand ready to help happy easter i have never been happier or more content because your country is doing so well with an economy that is the talk of the world and may be stronger than it has ever been before have a great day heartfelt condolences from the people of the united states to the people of sri lanka on the horrible terrorist attacks on churches and hotels that have killed at least 138 million people and badly injured 600 more we stand ready to help rt  prior reporting confirmed that some fbi agents were fed up with comey  thank you  and   good night of television 8:00 pm   9:00 pm  with interview of  followed by greg g honest commentary is always nice check out  life liberty  levin on  now 7pm if  spent the same energy fighting barack obama as he does fighting donald trump he could have won the race maybe  the end result of the greatest witch hunt in us political history is no collusion with russia and no obstruction pretty amazing united states weekly jobless claims just hit a 50 year low the economy is doing great the fake news media is doing everything possible to stir up and anger the pols and as many people as possible seldom mentioning the fact that the mueller report had as its principle conclusion the fact that there was no collusion with russia the russia hoax is dead despite the fact that the mueller report should not have been authorized in the first place  was written as nastily as possible by 13 18 angry democrats who were true trump haters including highly conflicted bob mueller himself the end result is no collusion no obstruction wishing a happy passover to all those celebrating in america israel and around the world  trump has been totally vindicated  time for democrats to accept reality  the washington post and new york times are in my opinion two of the most dishonest media outlets around truly the enemy of the people  big fat waste of time energy and money $30000000 to be exact it is now finally time to turn the tables and bring justice to some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes perhaps even spying or treason this should never happen again agreed to testify it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the report about me some of which are total bullshit  only given to make the other person look good or me to look bad this was an illegally started hoax that never should have happened a statements are made about me by certain people in the crazy mueller report in itself written by 18 angry democrat trump haters which are fabricated  totally untrue watch out for people that take so-called notes when the notes never existed until needed because i never rt  mueller's final report ‘completely vindicates' president trump 👇  kimberley strassel should get the pulitzer she is a treasure and i don't know her who correctly called the russia hoax right from the start others who were soooo wrong will get the prize fake news  the mueller report is perhaps the single most humiliating thing that has ever happened to the white house press in the history of this country they know they liedmany reporters lied about russia collusion and so much more clapper  brennan all lies  if dozens of federal prosecutors spent two years trying to charge you with a crime and found they couldn't it would mean there wasn't any evidence you did it and that's what happened here that's what we just learned from the mueller report   when there is not an underlying crime with regard to collusion in fact the whole thing was a made up fraud it is difficult to say that someone is obstructing something there was no underlying crime    anything the russians did concerning the 2016 election was done while obama was president he was told about it and did nothing most importantly the vote was not affected donald trump was being framed he fought back that is not obstruction   i had the right to end the whole witch hunt if i wanted i could have fired everyone including mueller if i wanted i chose not to i had the right to use executive privilege i didn't today i was thrilled to host the  soldier ride once again at the  we were all deeply honored to be in the presence of true american heroes as i have been saying all along no collusion no obstruction  no collusion no obstruction  attorney general william barr's press conference today at 9:30 am et watch on   presidential harassment the greatest

author trump hater christopher steele     the witch hunt has been a total fraud on your president and the american people it was brought to you by dirty cops crooked hillary and the dnc on trumps icc win dems and republicans see eye to eye | realclearpolitics  i believe it will be crazy bernie sanders vs sleepy joe biden as the two finalists to run against maybe the best economy in the history of our country and many other great things i look forward to facing whoever it may be may god rest their soul bernie sanders and wife should pay the pre-trump taxes on their almost $600000 in income he is always complaining about these big tax cuts except when it benefits him they made a fortune off of trump but so did everyone else and that's a good thing not a bad thing many trump fans  signs were

history if the mainstream media were honest which they are not this story would be bigger and more important than watergate someday god bless the people of france the forgotten voters of the 2016 election are now doing great the steel industry is rebuilding and expanding at a pace that it hasn't seen in decades our country has one of the best economies in many years perhaps ever unemployment

him on the great victory he had in yesterday's   to inform him that because of his incredible success  comeback in sports golf and more importantly life i will be presenting him with the presidential medal of freedom heading to the great state of minnesota since there was no collusion why was there an investigation in the first place answer dirty cops dems and crooked hillary the mueller report which was written by 18 angry democrats who also happen to be trump haters and clinton supporters should have focused on the people who spied on my 2016 campaign and others who fabricated the whole russia hoax that is never forget the crime those illegal immigrants who can no longer be legally held congress must fix the laws and loopholes will be subject to homeland security given to sanctuary cities and states mark morgan president obama's border patrol chief gave the following message to me president trump stay the course i agree and believe it or not we are making great progress with a system that has been broken for many years i finally agree with   the radical left democrats will never be satisfied with anything we give them they will always resist and obstruct they spied on my campaign we will never forget before nancy who has lost all control of congress and is getting nothing done decides to defend her leader rep omar she should look at the anti-semitic anti-israel and ungrateful us hate statements omar has made she is out of control except for her control of nancy congress should come back to dc now and fix the immigration laws mueller and the ag based on mueller findings and great intelligence have already ruled no collusion no obstruction these were crimes committed by crooked hillary the dnc dirty cops and others investigate the investigators what do i know about branding maybe nothing but i did become president but if i were boeing i would fix the boeing 737 max add some additional great features  rebrand the plane with a new nameno product has suffered like this one but again what the hell do i know chinese telecom giant huawei hires former obama cyber security official as a lobbyist this is not good or acceptable     this is president trump trying to deliver on his promises while the bureaucratic machine fights his agenda he needs populist allies these changes are not chaos but rather progress all this is president trump at his absolute best thank you steve such a puff piece on nancy pelosi by  yet her leadership has passed no meaningful legislation all they do is investigate as it turns out crimes that they instigated  committed the mueller no collusion decision wasn't even discussed-and she was a disaster at wh love people who are great under pressure what a fantastic life comeback for a really great guy  congratulations to  a truly great champion watching final hole of   is looking great great masters going on right now  is leading with 2 holes left to play very exciting tune in if the fed had done its job properly which it has not the stock market would have been up 5000 to 10000 additional points and gdp would have been well  over 4percent instead of 3percentwith almost no inflation quantitative tightening was a killer should have done the exact opposite just out the usa has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to sanctuary cities we hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level especially by the state of california which is well known or its poor management  high taxes democrats must change the immigration laws fast if not sanctuary cities must immediately act to take care of the illegal immigrants and this includes gang members drug dealers human traffickers and criminals of all shapes sizes and kinds change the laws now so interesting to see the mayor of oakland and other sanctuary cities not want our currently detained immigrants after release due to the ridiculous court ordered 20 day rule if they don't want to serve our nation by taking care of them why should other cities  towns i never offered pardons to homeland security officials never ordered anyone to close our southern border although i have the absolute right to do so and may if mexico does not apprehend the illegals coming to our border and am not frustrated it is all fake  corrupt news when i won the election in 2016 the  had to beg their fleeing subscribers for forgiveness in that they covered the election and me so badly they didn't have a clue it was pathetic they even apologized to me but now they are even worse really corrupt reporting the new york times sanctuary cities/immigration story today was knowingly wrong on almost every fact they never call to check for truth their sources often don't even exist a fraud they will lie  cheat anyway possible to make me look bad in 6 years they will be gone great playing by  at the  tomorrow will be a big and exciting day for golf and for sports many fantastic players in the hunt ratings gold good luck to all why should radical left democrats in congress have a right to retry and examine the $35000000 two years in the making no collusion mueller report when the crime committed was by crooked hillary the dnc and dirty cops attorney general barr will make the decision extraordinary growth economic success and riches under the leadership of chairman kim i look forward to the day which could be soon when nuclear weapons and sanctions can be removed and then watching north korea become one of the most successful nations of the world i agree with kim jong un of north korea that our personal relationship remains very good perhaps the term excellent would be even more accurate and that a third summit would be good in that we fully understand where we each stand north korea has tremendous potential for rt  we will never forget  in new york state democrats blocked a bill expanding college tuition for gold star families after approving aid for illegal immigrants no wonder so many people are leaving ny very sad another fake story on  that i offered pardons to homeland securiy personnel in case they broke the law regarding illegal immigration and sanctuary cities of course this is not true mainstream media is corrupt and getting worse if that is possible every day a fake story by politico made up sources thank you mount vernon  finally great news at the border  finally great news at the border  thank you jeh so well stated  if the radical left democrats all of a sudden don't want the illegal migrants in their sanctuary cities no more open arms why should others be expected to take them into their communities go home and come into our country legally and through a system of merit wsj's strassel barr 'right' to say 'spying' occurred on trump campaign | breitbart  via  we will never forget  the radical left always seems to have an open borders open arms policy  so this should make them very happy due to the fact that democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws we are indeed as reported giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only even the democrats now say that our southern border is a crisis and a national emergency hopefully we will not be getting any more bad outrageous court decisions democrats don't like the results of the mueller report so now they're trying everything else    they should stop wasting time and money and get back to real legislating especially on the border president obama's top white house lawyer gregory b craig was indicted yesterday on very serious charges this is a really big story but the fake news new york times didn't even put it on page one rather page 16  not much better tiny page one corrupt news i don't need to know any more we're done absolutely done he mueller tried the case there's no collusion     no matter what we do or give to the radical left it will never be enough great heroes  jobless claims at 50 year low and the radical dems reeling in disarray as the president continues to win win and win again the left is pretending to be shocked by ag william barr's testimony before congress in which he said spying did occur on the trump 2016 campaign    house democrats want to negotiate a $2 trillion spending increase but can't even pass their own plan we can't afford it anyway and it's not happening beautiful afternoon in the oval office today with a few great american heroes  biggest scandal of our time the coup that failed   spy games time for answers  rt  wow  got a well deserved ass kicking shame on you ted   great news   too bad that the european union is being so tough on the united kingdom and brexit the eu is likewise a brutal trading partner with the united states which will change sometimes in life you have to let people breathe before it all comes back to bite you i think what the democrats are doing with the border is treasonous their open border mindset is putting our country at risk will not let this happen congratulations to  and  on the great news so proud thank you texas i love you  join me in crosby texas as i deliver remarks and sign executive orders on energy and infrastructure  so it has now been determined by 18 people that truly hate president trump that there was no collusion with russia in fact it was an illegal investigation that should never have been allowed to start i fought back hard against this phony  treasonous hoax spoke to bibi  to congratulate him on a great and hard-fought win the united states is with him and the people of israel all the way  trump flags being waived at the bibi  victory celebration last night  everybody is now acknowledging that right from the time i announced my run for president i was 100percent correct on the border remember the heat i took democrats should now get rid of the loopholes the border is being fixed mexico will not let people through the democrats must end the loopholes on immigration so easy to solve the underlying issue remains the same without a single american being indicted for collusion with russia  that is a stunning end considering we were led to believe fake news that something much more dramatic would happen why did people fall for this  molly h thank you working hard  check this out truth  today it was my great honor to welcome president  of the arab republic of egypt to the   she congresswoman omar keeps on assaulting jews jeff ballabon b2 strategic ceo  what's completely unacceptable is for congesswoman omar to target jews in this case stephen miller jeff ballabon b2 strategic ceo   on national former prisoner of war recognition day we honor the americans captured and imprisoned by foreign powers while carrying out their duties to defend this great nation the mainstream media has never been more inaccurate or corrupt than it is today it only seems to get worse so much fake news i got along very well with jerry during the zoning and building process then i changed course slightly became president and now i am dealing with congressman nadler again some things never end but hopefully it will all go well for everyone only time will tell congressman jerry nadler fought me for years on a very large development i built on the west side of manhattan he wanted a rail yard built underneath the development or even better to stop the job he didn't get either  the development became very successful nevertheless the world trade organization finds that the european union subsidies to airbus has adversely impacted the united states which will now put tariffs on $11 billion of eu products the eu has taken advantage of the us on trade for many years it will soon stop make america great again  congratulations to virginia great game a 9th circuit judge just ruled that mexico is too dangerous for migrants so unfair to the us out of control  congratulations to the baylor lady bears on their amazing win last night against notre dame to become the 2019 ncaa women's basketball national champions  the democrats will never be satisfied no matter what they get how much they get or how many pages they get it will never end but that's the way life goes uganda must find the kidnappers of the american tourist and guide before people will feel safe in going there bring them to justice openly and quickly jerry nadler is not entitled to this information he is doing this to get it to the democrat 2020 nominee  the reason the whole process seems so politicized is that democrats made up this complete lie about collusion and none of it happened charles hurt the russian hoax never happened it was a fraud on the american people mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the united states or we will have no other choice than to close the border and/or institute tariffs our country is full more apprehensions capturesat the southern border than in many years border patrol amazing country is full system has been broken for many years democrats in congress must agree to fix loopholes no open borders crimes  drugs will close southern border if necessary i am pleased to announce that kevin mcaleenan the current us customs and border protection commissioner will become acting secretary for  i have confidence that kevin will do a great job secretary of homeland security kirstjen nielsen will be leaving her position and i would like to thank her for her service pleased to report that the american tourist and tour guide that were abducted in uganda have been released god bless them and their families looks like bob mueller's team of 13 trump haters  angry democrats are illegally leaking information to the press while the fake news media make up their own stories with or without sources sources no longer matter to our corrupt  dishonest mainstream media they are a joke in the meantime the democrats in congress must help the republicans we need their votes to end the horrible costly and foolish loopholes in our immigration laws once that happens all will be smooth we can never allow open borders it's powerful common sense immigration laws to stop illegals from coming through mexico into the us and removing them back to their country of origin until mexico cleans up this ridiculous  massive migration we will be focusing on border security not ports of entry we have redeployed 750 agents at the southern border's specific ports of entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the united states this will cause traffic  commercial delays until such time as mexico is able to use give up trump-haters  why should i be defending a fraudulent russian witch hunt it's about time the perpetrators of this fraud on me and the american people start defending their dishonest and treasonous acts how and why did this terrible event begin never forget to every member of the  thank you for your incredible support and your outstanding commitment to our country to our safety and to electing more republicans over the next 19 months i know that the  will help lead our party to another historic victory    against something i knew never existed collusion with russia so ridiculous no obstruction this russia hoax must never happen to another president and law enforcement must find out how did it start so let's get this straight there was no collusion and in fact the phony dossier was a con job that was paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc so the 13 angry democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up fraud i just fought back will be speaking today at the republican jewish coalition  meeting in las vegas nevada see everyone soon  years and $30 million and they found no collusion no obstruction but the democrats no matter what we give them will never be satisfied a total waste of time as  has just stated enough america has had enough what have you accomplished public is fed up i have not read the mueller report yet even though i have every right to do so only know the conclusions and on the big one no collusion likewise recommendations made to our great ag who found no obstruction 13 angry trump hating dems later brought to 18 given two thank you to two great people  collusion was a hoax from day one    the lowest average jobs number for any president since 1951 41percent economy doing great if the democrats win it is all over     i agree so let's get this straight there was no collusion and in fact the phony dossier was a con job that was paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc so the 13 angry democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up fraud i just fought back thank you   and   congratulations david a very big deal  just checked out the new wall on the border great leaving now for la join me in california for a roundtable on immigration and border security  just arrived in calexico california  will soon be landing in calexico california to look at a portion of the new wall being built on our southern border within two years we will have close to 400 miles built or under construction  keeping our country safe  not easy when the dems are always fighting to stop you the press is doing everything within their power to fight the magnificence of the phrase make america great again they can't stand the fact that this administration has done more than virtually any other administration in its first 2yrs they are truly the enemy of the people america created 196000 jobs in march beating expectations for 170000  i've employed thousands of electrical workers they will be voting for me congratulations to brian hagedorn on his big surprise win over a well funded liberal democrat in the great state of wisconsin for a very important supreme court seat republicans are producing big for wisconsin jobs jobs jobs  heading to the southern border to show a section of the new wall being built leaving now this will supersede usmca likewise i am looking at an economic penalty for the 500 billion dollars in illegal drugs that are shipped and smuggled through mexico and across our southern border over 10000 americans die each year sooo many families destroyed however if for any reason mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from the us will be forced to tariff at 25percent all cars made in mexico and shipped over the border to us if that doesn't work which it will i will close the border the crazed and dishonest washington post again purposely got it wrong mexico for the first time in decades is meaningfully apprehending illegals at their southern border before the long march up to the us this is great and the way it should be the big flow will stop trolling the mueller report democrats lost on collusion now they're inventing a coverup   james freeman  i am pleased to announce that jovita carranza will be nominated as the new  administrator she will be replacing linda mcmahon who has done an outstanding job jovita was a great treasurer of the united states  and i look forward to her joining my cabinet  how bad does border have to be for democrats to admit it's an emergency  conservative support for trump wall soars to 99 percent  democrats need to help fix the border crisis or get out of trump's way  thank you   welcome back joe  the new york times had no legitimate sources which would be totally illegal concerning the mueller report in fact they probably had no sources at all they are a fake news paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me there is nothing we can ever give to the democrats that will make them happy this is the highest level of presidential harassment in the history of our country according to polling few people seem to care about the russian collusion hoax but some democrats are fighting hard to keep the witch hunt alive they should focus on legislation or even better an investigation of how the ridiculous collusion delusion got started so illegal despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the fed the economy is looking very strong the china and usmca deals are moving along nicely there is little or no inflation and usa optimism is very high the republican party is the party of the american dream the first step act proves that our country can achieve amazing breakthroughs when we put politics aside and put the interests of all americans first   congress must get together and immediately eliminate the loopholes at the border if no action border or large sections of border will close this is a national emergency this will be a great campaign issue i never asked mitch mcconnell for a vote before the election as has been incorrectly reported as usual in the  but only after the election when we take back the house etc republicans will always support pre-existing conditions i was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 election on the wonderful healthcare package that some very talented people are now developing for me  the republican party it will be on full display during the election as a much better  less expensive alternative to obamacare today it was my great honor to welcome  secretary general  to the   today we celebrate the tremendous accomplishments of americans with asd and reaffirm our commitment to work together to ensure that every member of our society is afforded equal opportunities to reach their full potential  i haven't seen any democrats down here at the border working with us or asking to speak to any of us they have an open invitation we are getting overrun our facilities are overcapacity we are at an emergency crisis art del cueto national border patrol council after many years decades mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their southern border mostly from guatemala honduras and el salvador they have all been taking us money for years and doing absolutely nothing for us just like the democrats in congress there is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy jerry nadler or shifty adam schiff it is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great country robert mueller was a god-like figure to the democrats until he ruled no collusion in the long awaited $30000000 mueller report now the dems don't even acknowledge his name have become totally unhinged and would like to go through the whole process again it won't happen world autism awareness day 2019 significance history and theme via   in 1998 repjerry nadler strongly opposed the release of the starr report on bill clinton no information whatsoever would or could be legally released but with the no collusion mueller report which the dems hate he wants it all nothing will ever satisfy them  the best thing that ever happened to puerto rico is president donald j trump so many wonderful people but with such bad island leadership and with so much money wasted cannot continue to hurt our farmers and states with these massive payments and so little appreciation puerto rico got 91 billion dollars for the hurricane more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before  all their local politicians do is complain  ask for more money the pols are grossly incompetent spend the money foolishly or corruptly  only take from usa the crazed and incompetent mayor of san juan have done such a poor job  of bringing the island back to health 91 billion dollars to puerto rico and now the dems want to give them more taking dollars away from our farmers and so many others disgraceful are great but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt puerto rico got far more money than texas  florida combined yet their government can't do anything right the place is a mess nothing works fema  the military worked emergency miracles but politicians like the democrats today killed a bill that would have provided great relief to farmers and yet more money to puerto rico despite the fact that puerto rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any place in history the people of puerto rico back the house it will be truly great healthcare that will work for america also republicans will always support pre-existing conditions the republican party will be known as the party of great healtcare meantime the usa is doing better than ever  is respected again are developing a really great healthcare plan with far lower premiums cost  deductibles than obamacare in other words it will be far less expensive  much more usable than obamacare vote will be taken right after the election when republicans hold the senate  win everybody agrees that obamacare doesn't work premiums  deductibles are far too high really bad healthcare even the dems want to replace it but with medicare for all which would cause 180 million americans to lose their beloved private health insurance the republicans democrats should stop fighting sen david perdue's disaster relief bill they are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural america no matter what information is given to the crazed democrats from the no collusion mueller report it will never be good enough behind closed doors the dems are laughing the cost of obamacare is far too high for our great citizens the deductibles in many cases way over $7000 make it almost worthless or unusable good things are going to happen       can you believe that the radical left democrats want to do our new and very important census report without the all important citizenship question report would be meaningless and a waste of the $billions ridiculous that it costs to put together democrats working with republicans in congress can fix the asylum and other loopholes quickly we have a major national emergency at our border get it done now now that the long awaited mueller report conclusions have been released most democrats and othershave gone back to the pre-witch hunt phase of their lives before collusion delusion took over others are pretending that their former hero bob mueller no longer exists the democrats are allowing a ridiculous asylum system and major loopholes to remain as a mainstay of our immigration system mexico is likewise doing nothing a very bad combination for our country homeland security is being sooo very nice but not for long outrageous it's the adam schiff problem people abusing the access to classified data to then go out in public and make allegations that didn't prove to be true you look at a decision to essentially investigate a political rival who made it james freeman  everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the no collusion no obstruction trump campaign began we need to know for future generations to understand this hoax should never be allowed to happen to another president or administration again the trump administration has succeeded in dramatically raising the costs to iran for its sinister behavior at no cost to the us or our allies that's the definition of a foreign-policy achievement bret stephens   we are getting stronger all over the world watch mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the usa our detention areas are maxed out  we will take no more illegals next step is to close the border this will also help us with stopping the drug flow from mexico it would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid democrat inspired immigration laws in less than one hour and then a vote the problem would be solved but the dems don't care about the crime they don't want any victory for trump and the republicans even if good for usa in honor of his past service to our country navy seal  will soon be moved to less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court process should move quickly   a huge thanks to  for serving america at the  great work i'm proud to have you join the fulbright board  so funny that the new york times  the washington post got a pulitzer prize for their coverage 100percent negative and fake of collusion with russia and there was no collusion so they were either duped or corrupt in any event their prizes should be taken away by the committee the problem is no matter what the radical left democrats get no matter what we give them it will never be enough just watch they will harass  complain  resist the theme of their movement so maybe we should just take our victory and say no we've got a country to run robert mueller was a hero to the radical left democrats until he ruled that there was no collusion with russia so ridiculous to even say after more than two years since the insurance policy statement was made by a dirty cop i got the answers i wanted the truth had the fed not mistakenly raised interest rates especially since there is very little inflation and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening the 30percent gdp  stock market would have both been much higher  world markets would be in a better place the border or large sections of the border next week this would be so easy for mexico to do but they just take our money and talk besides we lose so much money with them especially when you add in drug trafficking etc that the border closing would be a good thing through their country and our southern border mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the us far greater than border costs if mexico doesn't immediately stop all illegal immigration coming into the united states throug our southern border i will be closing the democrats have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the world mexico has the strongest  they make more than $100 billion a year on the us therefore congress must change our weak immigration laws now  mexico must stop illegals from entering the us this has been an incredible couple of weeks for america  on this vietnam war veterans day we celebrate the brave vietnam veterans and all of america's veterans thank you for your service to our great nation working hard thank you   make america great again   massive overflow crowds in grand rapids michigan tonight thank you for joining us tonight   beautiful  tonight in grand rapids michigan thank you i love you make america great again  on my way to grand rapids michigan right now see you all very soon   we have a national emergency at our southern border the dems refuse to do what they know is necessary amend our immigration laws would immediately solve the problem mexico with the strongest immigration laws in the world refuses to help with illegal immigration  drugs the republican party will become the party of great healthcare obamacare is a disaster far too expensive and deductibility ridiculously high virtually unusable moving forward in courts and legislatively very important that opec increase the flow of oil world markets are fragile price of oil getting too high thank you wow ratings for morning joe which were really bad in the first place just tanked with the release of the mueller report likewise other shows on msnbc and cnn have gone down by as much as 50percent just shows fake news never wins congressman adam schiff who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking should be forced to resign from congress fbi  doj to review the outrageous jussie smollett case in chicago it is an embarrassment to our nation mexico is doing nothing to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our country they are all talk and no action likewise honduras guatemala and el salvador have taken our money for years and do nothing the dems don't care such bad laws may close the southern border the fake news media is going crazy they are suffering a major breakdown have zero credibility or respect  must be thinking about going legit i have learned to live with fake news which has never been more corrupt than it is right now someday i

illegal democrat witch hunt of your all time favorite duly elected president me tv ratings of cnn  msnbc tanked last night after seeing the mueller report statement  up big i think this is probably the most consequential media screwup of the last 25 to 50 years it is difficult to comprehend or overstate the damage that the media did to the country to their own reputation or to the constitution an absolute catastrophe sean davis   proclamation on recognizing the golan heights as part of the state of israel   thank you to the house republicans for sticking together and the big win today on the border today's vote simply reaffirms congressional democrats are the party of open borders drugs and crime a catastrophic media failure  the republican party will become the party of healthcare what we're seeing on capitol hill right now is that the democrats are walking back any charges of collusion against the president   should never have been started a disgrace the mainstream media is under fire and being scorned all over the world as being corrupt and fake for two years they pushed the russian collusion delusion when they always knew there was no collusion they truly are the enemy of the people and the real opposition party what we're seeing on capital hill right now is that the democrats are walking back any charges of collusion against the president    should never have been

democrats are getting very strange they now want to change the voting age to 16 abolish the electoral college and increase significantly the number of supreme court justices actually you've got to win it at the ballot box not a good situation  just the large states the cities would end up running the country smaller states  the entire midwest would end up losing all power  we can't let that happen i used to like the idea of the popular vote but now realize the electoral college is far better for the usa campaigning for the popular vote is much easier  different than campaigning for the electoral college it's like training for the 100 yard dash vs a marathon the brilliance of the electoral college is that you must go to many states to win with the popular vote you go to thank you  could not have said it any better myself  amazingly cnn just released a poll at 71percent saying that the economy is in the best shape since 2001 18 years wow is cnn becoming a believer i will be

christopher steele backed up his democrat  crooked hillary paid for fake  unverified dossier with information he got from send in watchers of low ratings cnn this is the info that got us the witch

for france after 18 weeks of rioting by the yellow vest protesters i guess not so well in the meantime the united states has gone to the top of all lists on the environment google is helping china and their military but not the us terrible the good news is that they helped crooked hillary clinton and not trumpand how did that turn out because the economy is so good general motors must get their lordstown ohio plant open maybe in a different form or with a new owner fast toyota is investing 135 $billion in us others likewise gm must act quickly time is of the essence spreading the fake and totally discredited dossier is unfortunately a very dark stain against john mccain ken starr former independent counsel he had far worse stains than this including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace this is a national emergency mark morgan former border patrol chief with great experience in law enforcement really understands the subjects of immigration and the border thank you mark   veto message to the house of representatives for hj res 46   on the recent non-binding vote 420-0 in congress about releasing the mueller report i told leadership to let all republicans vote for transparency makes us all look good and doesn't matter play along with the game just spoke w/  the people of nebraska  across the midwest especially the farmers  ranchers are feeling the impacts from severe weather the first responders  emergency response teams have done a great job dealing w/ record flooding high winds  road closures that we stand in solidarity with new zealand  and that any assistance the usa can give we stand by ready to help we love you new zealand just spoke with jacinda ardern the prime minister of new zealand regarding the horrific events that have taken place over the past 24 hours i informed the prime minister i'd like to thank all of the great republican senators who bravely voted for strong border security and the wall this will help stop crime human trafficking and drugs entering our country watch when you get back to your state they will love you more than ever before this should never happen to a president again should never have been appointed and there should be no mueller report this was an illegal  conflicted investigation in search of a crime russian collusion was nothing more than an excuse by the democrats for losing an election that they thought they were going to win so if there was knowingly  acknowledged to be zero crime when the special counsel was appointed and if the appointment was made based on the fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary and now disgraced andrew mccabe he  all stated no crime then the special counsel new evidence that the obama era team of the fbi doj  cia were working together to spy on and take out president trump all the way back in 2015 a transcript of peter strzok's testimony is devastating hopefully the mueller report will be covering this   the ‘jexodus' movement encourages jewish people to leave the democrat party total disrespect republicans are waiting with open arms remember jerusalem us embassy and the horrible iran nuclear deal    my warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of new zealand after the horrible massacre in the mosques 49 innocent people have so senselessly died with so many more seriously injured the us stands by new zealand for anything we can do god bless all breitbart news network  via  i look forward to vetoing the just passed democrat inspired resolution which would open borders while increasing crime drugs and trafficking in our country i thank all of the strong republicans who voted to support border security and our desperately needed wall veto congratulations  big news for us auto workers the usmca is already fixing the broken nafta deal  a vote for today's resolution by republican senators is a vote for nancy pelosi crime and the open border democrats if at a later date congress wants to update the law i will support those efforts but today's issue is border security and crime don't vote with pelosi prominent legal scholars agree that our actions to address the national emergency at the southern border and to protect the american people are both constitutional and expressly authorized by congress happy national ag day  the three very weak and untalented late night hosts are fighting over table scraps carson did a great job it wasn't political i don't know what they're going to do in 2024 when he's no longer president  will be wacky in the unemployment line michael loftus  the democrats are border deniers they refuse to see or acknowledge the death crime drugs and human trafficking at our southern border my administration looks forward to negotiating a large scale trade deal with the united kingdom the potential is unlimited a big national emergency vote today by the united states senate on border security  the wall which is already under major construction i am prepared to veto if necessary the southern border is a national security and humanitarian nightmare but it can be easily fixed democrats are frantic to throw something else at the president that's why you saw those 81 subpoenas it's ridiculous just because your still upset over an election that happened 2 1/2 years ago you should not be allowed to ruin people's lives like this lara trump  i agree with rand paul this is a total disgrace and should never happen to another president  the lisa page fbi transcript also confirms earlier reporting that page testified russian collusion was still unproven when special counsel robert mueller was appointed catherine herridge   in other words they appointed someone when there was and is no crime bad double standard former fbi lawyer lisa page admits being told to go easy on clinton  very unfair   republican senators are overthinking tomorrow's vote on national emergency it is very simply border security/no crime should not be thought of any other way we have a major national emergency at our border and the people of our country know it very well democrats will have a unanimous vote on a 20percent issue in opposing republican senators tomorrow the dems are for open borders and crime comey testified under oath that it was a unanimous decision on crooked hillary lisa page transcripts show he lied  the fake news photoshopped pictures of melania then propelled conspiracy theories that it's actually not her by my side in alabama and other places they are only getting more deranged with time the just revealed fbi agent lisa page transcripts make the obama justice department look exactly like it was a broken and corrupt machine hopefully justice will finally be served much more to come defying voters the governor of california will halt all death penalty executions of 737 stone cold killers friends and families of the always forgotten victims are not thrilled and neither am i keep america great make america great again jay leno points out that comedy on the very boring late night shows is totally one-sided it's tough when there's only one topic   actually the one-sided hatred on these shows is incredible and for me unwatchable but remember we are number one president a man who is considered by many to be the president with the most successful first two years in history especially when he has done nothing wrong and impeachment is for high crimes and misdemeanors i greatly appreciate nancy pelosi's statement against impeachment but everyone must remember the minor fact that i never did anything wrong the economy and unemployment are the best ever military and vets are great and many other successes how do you impeach so many records being set with respect to our economy unemployment numbers among best ever a beautiful thing to watch all part of the witch hunt hoax started by little eric schneiderman  cuomo so many leaving new york  all part of the witch hunt hoax started by little eric schneiderman  coumo so many leaving new york  rt  the ny attorney general called president trump an illegitimate president she has proven to have a vendetta against  all part of the witch hunt  new york state and its governor andrew cuomo are now proud members of the group of presidential harassers no wonder people are fleeing the state in record numbers the witch hunt continues needed and the complexity creates danger all of this for great cost yet very little gain i don't know about you but i don't want albert einstein to be my pilot i want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly pilots are no longer needed but rather computer scientists from mit i see it all the time in many products always seeking to go one unnecessary step further when often old and simpler is far better split second decisions are patrick moore co-founder of greenpeace the whole climate crisis is not only fake news it's fake science there is no climate crisis there's weather and climate all around the world and in fact carbon dioxide is the main building block of all life   wow jewish people are leaving the democratic party we saw a lot of anti israel policies start under the obama administration and it got worsts  worse there is anti-semitism in the democratic party they don't care about israel or the jewish people elizabeth pipko jexodus republican senators have a very easy vote this week it is about border security and the wall stopping crime drugs etc not constitutionality and precedent it is an 80percent positive issue the dems are 100percent united as usual on a 20percent issue open borders and crime get tough r's making daylight saving time permanent is ok with me at a recent round table meeting of business executives  long after formally introducing tim cook of apple i quickly referred to tim + apple as tim/apple as an easy way to save time  words the fake news was disparagingly all over this  it became yet another bad trump story there's not one shred of evidence that president trump has done anything wrong  one america news  so true a total witch hunt all started illegally by crooked hillary clinton the dnc and others more people are working today in the united states 158000000 than at any time in our country's history that is a big deal despite the most hostile and corrupt media in the history of american politics the trump administration has accomplished more in its first two years than any other administration judges biggest tax  regulation cuts va choice best economy lowest unemployment  much more donald trump's approval rating is at or near his highest level ever the media is not being honest about what is happening in this country jesse watters will soon be 145 judges  this is just the beginning  the witch hunt continues  and renovated with much more to follow shortly tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended captured at the border and not allowed into our country with another president millions would be pouring in i am stopping an invasion as the wall gets built  wacky nut job  who still hasn't figured out that despite all odds and an entire democrat party of far left radicals against me not to mention certain republicans who are sadly unwilling to fight i am winning on the border major sections of wall are being built i hope the grandstanding governor of california is able to spend his very highly taxed citizens money on asylum holds more efficiently than money has been spent on the so-called fast train which is $billions over budget  in total disarray time to reduce taxes in california border patrol and law enforcement has apprehended captured large numbers of illegal immigrants at the border they won't be coming into the us the wall is being built and will greatly help us in the future and now   the only time that michael cohen told the truth is when he pled that he is guilty  also when he said no collusion and i did not tell him to lie unimaginable loss such great people  sessions didn't have a clue  aluminum prices are down 12percent since i instituted tariffs on aluminum dumping and the us will be taking in billions plus jobs nice as secretary of the air force and i know she will be equally great in the very important world of higher education a strong thank you to heather for her service congratulations to heather wilson who is the sole finalist to become the next president of university of texas at el paso effective september 1 2019 heather has done an absolutely fantastic job bad lawyer and fraudster michael cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a pardon his lawyers totally contradicted him he lied additionally he directly asked me for a pardon i said no he lied again he also badly wanted to work at the white house he lied heading now to the great state of alabama on international women's day we honor women worldwide for their vital role in shaping and strengthening our communities families governments and businesses women's unemployment rate is down to 36percent was 79percent in january 2011 things are looking good we are apprehending record numbers of illegal immigrants but we need the wall to help our great border patrol agents this is as good a time as i can remember to be an american worker we have the strongest economy in the world  stuart varney   so true both the judge and the lawyer in the paul manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was no collusion with russia but the witch hunt hoax continues as you now add these statements to house  senate intelligence  senator burr so bad for our country presidential harassment i cannot believe the level of dishonesty in the media it is totally out of control but we are winning thank you  great show the wall is being built and is well under construction big impact will be made many additional contracts are close to being signed far ahead of schedule despite all of the democrat obstruction and fake news breaking news  cohen's lawyer contradicts cohen's testimony about never seeking a presidential pardon we are on track to apprehend more than one million people coming across the southern border this year great job by border patrol and others who are working in a broken system can be fixed by congress so easily and quickly if only the democrats would get on board it was not a campaign contribution and there were no violations of the campaign finance laws by me fake news democrats just blocked  from holding a debate good then i think i'll do the same thing with the fake news networks and the radical left democrats in the general election debates wall street journal more migrant families crossing into the us illegally have been arrested in the first five months of the federal fiscal year than in any prior full year we are doing a great job at the border but this is a national emergency congressman chris stewart no one is accusing the president of a crime and yet they the democrats are issuing hundreds of subpoenas this is unprecedented they are desperately trying to find anything they can even a punctuation mistake in a document american workforce policy advisory board meeting at the   it is shameful that house democrats won't take a stronger stand against anti-semitism in their conference anti-semitism has fueled atrocities throughout history and it's inconceivable they will not act to condemn it senate republicans are not voting on constitutionality or precedent they are voting on desperately needed border security  the wall our country is being invaded with drugs human traffickers  criminals of all shapes and sizes that's what this vote is all about stay united weirdo tom steyer doesn't have the guts or money to run for president he's all talk  hans von spakovsky i haven't seen any evidence of actual violations of the law which is usually a basis before you start an investigation adam schiff seems to be copying joseph mccarthy in wanting to open up investigations when they don't have any evidence of wrongdoing presidential harassment  crooked hillary clinton confirms she will not run in 2020 rules out a third bid for white house aw-shucks does that mean i won't get to run against her again she will be sorely missed scott has helped us to lower drug prices get a record number of generic drugs approved and onto the market and so many other things he and his talents will be greatly missed scott gottlieb who has done an absolutely terrific job as commissioner of the fda plans to leave government service sometime next month just a few moments ago i signed an eo addressing one of our nation's most heartbreaking tragedies veterans suicide to every veterani want you to know that you have an entire nation of more than 300 million people behind you you will never be forgotten our great first lady  will be doing a live show today at 1:00 pm pt with the terrific  at the  resort she's on her  tour helping address the  free admission for the first 1500 people republican approval rating just hit 93percent sorry haters make america great again presidential harassment the greatest overreach in the history of our country the dems are obstructing justice and will not get anything done a big fat fishing expedition desperately in search of a crime when in fact the real crime is what the dems are doing and have done hiv is cured in 2nd patient doctors report   such great news for so many tremendous progress being made now that they realize the only collusion with russia was done by crooked hillary clinton  the democrats nadler schiff and the dem heads of the committees have gone stone cold crazy 81 letter sent to innocent people to harass them they won't get anything done for our country  is indeed a star thank you center for urban renewal  ed   representative ilhan omar is again under fire for her terrible comments concerning israel jewish groups have just sent a petition to speaker pelosi asking her to remove omar from foreign relations committee a dark day for israel we the people will now be subjected to the biggest display of modern day mccarthyismwhich is the widest fishing net expeditionevery aspect of the presidents lifeall in order to get power back so they can institute socialism  we the people will now be subjected to the biggest display of modern day mccathyismwhich is the widest fishing net expeditionevery aspect of the presidents lifeall in order to get power back so they can institute socialism   amazon like the washington post it's hard to remember that not so long ago america had prestige media outlets but not anymore    the fake news media is the true enemy of the people the american media has changed forever news organizations that seemed like a big deal are now extinct  those that remain have now degraded themselves beyond recognition like the new yorker or they've been purchased by jeff bezos to conduct unregistered lobbying for presidential harassment  there is no collusion all of these investigations are in search of a crime democrats have no evidence to impeach president trump ridiculous   now that the dems are going to try  switch from collusion to some other reason it makes them continue to look like sore losers who didn't accept the will of the people in the last election they will do anything to get rid of the president  it will never work the military drills or war games as i call them were never even discussed in my mtg w/ kim jong un of nkfake news i made that decision long ago because it costs the us far too much money to have those games especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost fema has been told directly by me to give the a plus treatment to the great state of alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the tornadoes  one of the best in our country has been so informed she is working closely with fema and me to the great people of alabama and surrounding areas please be careful and safe tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming to the families and friends of the victims and to the injured god bless you all fema has been told directly by me to give the a plus treatment to the great state of alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the tornadoes  one of the best in our country has been so informed she is working closely with fema and me and also illegally leaking to fake news cnn  others  schumer  the democrats are hurting our country senate republicans must take bold action  rt   president trump made america great again  now it's up to us to help him keep america great  for the democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar  fraudster at the same time as the very important nuclear summit with north korea is perhaps a new low in american politics and may have contributed to the walk never done when a president is overseas shame president we are winning big the envy of the world but just think what it could be presidential harassment by crazed democrats at the highest level in the history of our country likewise the most vicious and corrupt mainstream media that any president has ever had to endure yet the most successful first two years for any the reason i do not want military drills with south korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the us for which we are not reimbursed that was my position long before i became president also reducing tensions with north korea at this time is a good thing my wonderful daughter ivanka will be interviewed tonight by steve hilton on the next revolution  9:00 pm she works so hard and has achieved so much for the usaand gets so little credit then watch mark levin at 10:00 pm a great show look how they're acting now and how we act when we're in the majority what the democrats are doing is an abuse of power they couldn't find anythingthey took a fake dossier  couldn't find any collusion now they have a fake witness in cohen congressman mark green r-tn after more than two years of presidential harassment the only things that have been proven is that democrats and other broke the law the hostile cohen testimony given by a liar to reduce his prison time proved no collusion his just written book manuscript showed what he said was a total lie but fake media won't show it i am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad conflicted  corrupt people in a witch hunt that is illegal  should never have been allowed to start and only because i won the election despite this great success we've got nasa rocking again great activity and success congrats to spacex and all the brand new manuscript for a new book by failed lawyer michael cohen shows his testimony was a total lie pundits should only use it virtually everything failed lawyer michael cohen said in his sworn testimony last week is totally contradicted in his just released manuscript for a book about me it's a total new love letter to trump and the pols must now use it rather than his lies for sentence reduction thank you    it was a 3 day train ride to vietnam not 3 hours will be speaking at cpac at 11:30 this morning record crowd live broadcast enjoy very proud of perhaps the greatest golf course anywhere in the world also furthers uk relationship  and i did not increase their second traunch of tariffs to 25percent on march 1st this is very important for our great farmers and me i have asked china to immediately remove all tariffs on our agricultural products including beef pork etc based on the fact that we are moving along nicely with trade discussions for otto's mistreatment and death most important otto warmbier will not have died in vain otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength which will last for many years into the future i love otto and think of him often i never like being misinterpreted but especially when it comes to otto warmbier and his great family remember i got otto out along with three others the previous administration did nothing and he was taken on their watch of course i hold north korea responsible michael cohen's book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before he must have forgotten about his book when he testified what does hillary clinton's lawyer lanny davis say about this one is he being paid by crooked hillary using her lawyer and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on wednesday no way it's time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought witch hunt time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed republicans have been abused long enough must end now oh' i see now that the 2 year russian collusion case has fallen apart there was no collusion except bye crooked hillary and the democrats they say gee i have an idea let's look at trump's finances and every deal he has ever done let's follow discredited michael cohen congress must demand the transcript of michael cohen's new book given to publishers a short time ago your heads will spin when you see the lies misrepresentations and contradictions  against his thursday testimony like a different person he is totally discredited wow just revealed that michael cohen wrote a love letter to trump manuscript for a new book that he was pushing written and submitted long after charlottesville and helsinki his phony reasons for going rogue book is exact opposite of his fake testimony which now is a lie great to be back from vietnam an amazing place we had very substantive negotiations with kim jong un we know what they want and they know what we must have relationship very good let's see what happens today in alaska it was my great honor to visit with our brave men and
