blumenthal the third rate senator from connecticut how is connecticut doing his war stories of his heroism in vietnam were a total fraud he was never even there we talked about it today with vietnamese leaders the democrats should stop talking about what i should do with north korea and ask themselves instead why they didn't do it during eight years of the obama administration vietnam is thriving like few places on earth north korea would be the same and very quickly if it would denuclearize the potential is awesome a great opportunity like almost none other in history for my friend kim jong un we will know fairly soon very interesting just arrived in vietnam thank you to all of the people for the great reception in hanoi tremendous crowds and so much love this will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of congress if there is one thing we should all agree on it's protecting the lives of innocent babies senate democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children the democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don't mind executing babies after birth if a deal is made with china our great american farmers will be treated better than they have ever been treated before heading over to vietnam for my meeting with kim jong un looking forward to a very productive summit china trade deal and more in

with us be strong and smart don't fall into the democrats trap of open borders and crime former senator harry reid he got thrown out is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career he led through lies and deception only to be replaced by another beauty cryin' chuck schumer some things just never change meeting for breakfast with our nation's governors then off to vietnam for a very important summit with kim jong un with complete denuclearization north korea will rapidly become an economic powerhouse without it just more of the same chairman kim will make a wise decision oil

racist hit on your president who has done more for african americans criminal justice reform lowest unemployment numbers in history tax cutsetc than almost any other pres we have a state of emergency

important structural issues including intellectual property protection technology transfer agriculture services currency and many other issues as a result of these very so funny to watch people who

committeeand where's the server that the dnc refused to give to the fbi  where are the new texts between agent lisa page and her agent lover peter s we want them now 93percent approval rating in the

in the world because of its location and people and him it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation president xi of china has been very helpful in his support of my meeting with kim jong un the last thing china wants are large scale nuclear weapons right next door sanctions placed on the border by china and russia have been very helpful great relationship with chairman kim very productive talks yesterday with china on trade will continue today i will be leaving for hanoi vietnam early tomorrow for a summit with kim jong un of north korea where we both expect a continuation

anything else wrong graham ledger  thank you graham so true the people of venezuela stand at the threshold of history ready to reclaim their country  and their future  there is far more energy on the right than there is on the left that's why we just won the senate and why we will win big in 2020 the fake news just doesn't want to report the facts border security is a big factor the under construction wall will stop gangs drugs and crime god bless the people of venezuela great new book the case for trump by victor davis hanson hoover senior fellow kelly has done an outstanding job

border the second amendment and loves our military and vets john has my complete and total endorsement make america great again  what about maga and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments  the wall is under construction right now  something that is so obviously the future i want the united states to win through competition not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies we must always be the leader in everything we do especially when it comes to the very exciting world of technology i want 5g and even 6g technology in the united states as soon as possible it is far more powerful faster and smarter than the current standard american companies must step up their efforts or get left behind there is no reason that we should be lagging behind on i have instructed secretary of state mike pompeo and he fully agrees not to allow hoda muthana back into the country we have just built this powerful wall in new mexico completed on january 30 2019  47 days ahead of schedule many miles more now under construction   california now wants to scale back their already failed fast train project by substantially shortening the distance so that it no longer goes from la to san francisco a different deal and record cost overruns send the federal government back the billions of dollars wasted the new york times reporting is false they are a true enemy of the people if thinking that james comey is not a good fbi director is tantamount to being an agent of russia than just list all the people that are agents of russia chuck schumer nancy pelosi rod rosenstein who wrote the memo to get rid of comey the inspector general trey gowdy the washington post ignored basic journalistic standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented biased agenda against president donald j trump covington student suing wapo go get them nick fake news the press has never been more dishonest than it is today stories are written that have absolutely no basis in fact the writers don't even call asking for verification they are totally out of control sadly i kept many of them in business in six years they all go bust crazy bernie has just entered the race i wish him well andrew mccabe gave absolutely no evidence of any threat to substantiate his absurd claim  i never said anything bad about andrew mccabe's wife other than she they should not have taken large amounts of campaign money from a crooked hillary source when clinton was under investigation by the fbi i never called his wife a loser to him another mccabe made up lie the washington post is a fact checker only for the democrats for the republicans and for your all time favorite president it is a fake fact checker the failed fast train project in california where the cost overruns are becoming world record setting is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed wall as i predicted 16 states led mostly by open border democrats and the radical left have filed a lawsuit in of course the 9th circuit california the state that has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control fast train with no hope of completion seems in charge the failed fast train project in california were the cost overruns are becoming world record setting is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed wall as i predicted 16 cities led mostly by open border democrats and the radical left have filed a lawsuit in of course the 9th circuit california the state that has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control fast train with no hope of completion seems in charge had the opposition party no not the media won the election the stock market would be down at least 10000 points by now we are heading up up up the witch hunt in time likely will become recognized as the greatest scandal in american political history marking the first occasion in which the us government bureaucrats sought to overturn an election presidential victor davis hanson  and got caught  remember this andrew mccabe didn't go to the bathroom without the approval of leakin' james comey thank you andrew we all miss beautiful meadow  thank you jt  amazing  the biggest abuse of power and corruption scandal in our history and it's much worse than we thought andrew mccabe fbi admitted to plotting a coup government overthrow when he was serving in the fbi before he was fired for lying  leaking    treason today more than 50 countries around the world now recognize the rightful government of venezuela the venezuelan people have spoken and the world has heard their voice they are turning the page on socialism and dictatorship and there will be no going back  i ask every member of the maduro regime end this nightmare of poverty hunger and death let your people go set your country free now is the time for all venezuelan patriots to act together as one united people nothing could be better for the future of venezuela the

venezuela and across the western hemisphere socialism is dying and liberty prosperity and democracy are being reborn hope you are enjoying your president's day our country is making unprecedented progress this was an illegal coup attempt on the president of the united states dan bongino on   true great analysis by  there is a lot of explaining to do to the millions of people who had just elected a president who they really like and who has done a great job for them with the military vets economy and so much more this was the illegal and treasonous insurance policy in full action wow so many lies by now disgraced acting fbi director andrew mccabe he was fired for lying and now his story gets even more deranged he and rod rosenstein who was hired by jeff sessions another beauty look like they were planning a very illegal act and got caught after two years and interviewing more than two hundred witnesses the senate intelligence committee has not discovered any direct evidence of a conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia  ken dilanian  william barr is arriving at a justice department that desperately needs an infusion of credibility writes   via  the mueller investigation is totally conflicted illegal and rigged should never have been allowed to begin except for the collusion and many crimes committed by the democrats witch hunt these guys the investigators ought to be in jail what they have done working with the obama intelligence agencies is simply unprecedented this is one of the greatest political hoaxes ever perpetrated on the people of this country and mueller is a coverup  rush limbaugh the rigged and corrupt media is the enemy of the people nothing funny about tired saturday night live on fake news nbc question is how do the networks get away with these total republican hit jobs without retribution likewise for many other shows very unfair and should be looked into this is the real collusion 52percent approval rating 93percent in republican party  a record  pretty amazing considering that 93percent also of my press is really bad the people are smart democrats in the senate are still slow walking hundreds of highly qualified people wanting to come into government never been such an abuse in our country's history mitch should not let senate go home until all are approved we need our ambassadors and all others now rt   important meetings and calls on china trade deal and more today with my staff big progress being made on soooo many different fronts our country has such fantastic potential for future growth and greatness on an even higher level the us does not want to watch as these isis fighters permeate europe which is where they are expected to go we do so much and spend so much time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing we are pulling back after 100percent caliphate victory the united states is asking britain france germany and other european allies to take back over 800 isis fighters that we captured in syria and put them on trial the caliphate is ready to fall the alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them trade negotiators have just returned from china where the meetings on trade were very productive now at meetings with me at mar-a-lago giving the details in the meantime billions of dollars are being paid to the united states by china in the form of trade tariffs building the wall great job by law enforcement in aurora illinois heartfelt condolences to all of the victims and their families america is with you trying to use the 25th amendment to try and circumvent the election is a despicable act of unconstitutional power grabbingwhich happens in third world countries you have to obey the law this is an attack on our system  constitution alan dershowitz  after the flight 93 election the vote that saved america and what we still have to lose by very talented michael anton is a terrific read check it out one year ago today a horrific act of violence took the lives of 14 students and 3 educators in parkland florida on this somber anniversary we honor their memory and recommit to ensuring the safety of all americans especially our nation's children   reviewing the funding bill with my team at the  many of the top fbi brass were fired forced to leave or left mccabe's wife received big dollars from clinton people for her campaign he gave hillary a pass mccabe is a disgrace to the fbi and a disgrace to our country make america great again disgraced fbi acting director andrew mccabe pretends to be a poor little angel when in fact he was a big part of the crooked hillary scandal  the russia hoax a puppet for leakin' james comey ig report on mccabe was devastating part of insurance policy in case i won funding bill california has been forced to cancel the massive bullet train project after having spent and wasted many billions of dollars they owe the federal government three and a half billion dollars we want that money back now whole project is a green disaster today it was my great honor to address the  association and  conference in washington dc we will never forget your service and we will never ever let you down we love you and we thank god for you each and every day  the gallup poll just announced that 69percent of our great citizens expect their finances to improve next year a 16 year high nice the senate intelligence committee there is no evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and russia i want to thank all republicans for the work you have done in dealing with the radical left on border security not an easy task but the wall is being built and will be a great achievement and contributor toward life and safety within our country rt  they are soooo beautiful and magnificent ❤️❤️❤️❤️  thank you to   will be getting almost $23 billion for border security regardless of wall money it is being built as we speak was just presented the concept and parameters of the border security deal by hard working senator richard shelby looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources beautiful evening in el paso texas last night god bless the usa  we are fighting for all americans from all backgrounds of every age race religion birthplace color  creed our agenda is not a partisan agenda  it is the mainstream common sense agenda of the american people thank you el paso texas i love you  coal is an important part of our electricity generation mix and  should give serious consideration to all factors before voting to close viable power plants like paradise  in kentucky ۴۰ سال فساد ۴۰ سال سرکوب ۴۰ سال ترور رژیم ایران فقط موجب #چهل_سال_شکست شده است مردم ایران که مدتهاست در رنجند شایسته آینده روشن تری هستند  40 years of corruption 40 years of repression 40 years of terror the regime in iran has produced only  the long-suffering iranian people deserve a much brighter future  will be heading to el paso very soon big speech on border security and much else tonight tremendous crowd see you later the democrats are so self righteous and angry loosen up and have some fun the country is doing well the democrats do not want us to detain or send back criminal aliens this is a brand new demand crazy no president ever worked harder than me cleaning up the mess i inherited fact checkers have become fake news    so true the us will soon control 100percent of isis territory in syria  do you believe this well it happened again amy klobuchar announced that she is running for president talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow ice and freezing temperatures bad timing by the end of her speech she looked like a snowmanwoman the border committee democrats are behaving all of a sudden irrationally not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed wall they overrode recommendations of border patrol experts but they don't even want to take muderers into custody what's going on president is on sound legal ground to declare a national emergency there have been 58 national emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976 and 31 right now that are currently active so this is hardly unprecedented congressman  the fact is when i took over as president our country was a mess depleted military endless wars a potential war with north korea va high taxes  too many regulations border immigration  healthcare problems  much more i had no choice but to work very long hours the media was able to get my work schedule something very easy to do but it should have been reported as a positive not negative when the term executive time is used i am generally working not relaxing in fact i probably work more hours than almost any past president it was a very bad week for the democrats with the great economic numbers the virginia disaster and the state of the union address now with the terrible offers being made by them to the border committee i actually believe they want a shutdown they want a new subject i don't think the dems on the border committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal they are offering very little money for the desperately needed border wall  now out of the blue want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention gallup poll open borders will potentially attract 42 million latin americans this would be a disaster for the us we need the wall now african americans are very angry at the double standard on full display in virginia senator richard burr the chairman of the senate intelligence committee just announced that after almost two years more than two hundred interviews and thousands of documents they have found no collusion between trump and russia is anybody really surprised by this i think it is very important for the democrats to press forward with their green new deal it would be great for the so-called carbon footprint to permanently eliminate all planes cars cows oil gas  the military even if no other country would do the same brilliant today elizabeth warren sometimes referred to by me as pocahontas joined the race for president will she run as our first native american presidential candidate or has she decided that after 32 years this is not playing so well anymore see you on the campaign trail liz the democrats just don't seem to want border security they are fighting border agents recommendations if you believe news reports they are not offering much for the wall they look to be making this a campaign issue the wall will get built one way or the other we have a great economy despite the obama administration and all of its job killing regulations and roadblocks if that thinking prevailed in the 2016 election the us would be in a depression right now we were heading down and don't let the democrats sound bites fool you the democrats in congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see when the republicans had the majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn the dems are trying to win an election in 2020 that they know they cannot legitimately win it was great meeting some of our outstanding young military personnel who were wounded in both syria and afghanistan their wounds are deep but their spirit is sooo high they will recoverer  be back very soon america loves them walter reed hospital is amazing thank you all rt  adam schiff glenn simpson and their forrest gump-like encounter in aspen  rt   rt  trump not only did senator burr's committee find no collusion by the trump campaign and russia it's important because t north korea under the leadership of kim jong un will become a great economic powerhouse he may surprise some but he won't surprise me because i have gotten to know him  fully understand how capable he is north korea will become a different kind of rocket an economic one my representatives have just left north korea after a very productive meeting and an agreed upon time and date for the second summit with kim jong un it will take place in hanoi vietnam on february 27  28 i look forward to seeing chairman kim  advancing the cause of peace i was a big fan of frank robinson both as a great player and man he was the first african american manager in baseball and was highly respected at everything he did he will he missed deepest sympathies to congresswoman debbie dingell and the entire family of john dingell longest serving congressman in country's history which if people understand politics means he was very smart a great reputation and highly respected man working hard thank you  it is all a giant and illegal hoax developed long before the election itself but used as an excuse by the democrats as to why crooked hillary clinton lost the election someday the fake news media will turn honest  report that donald j trump was actually a great candidate the mainstream media has refused to cover the fact that the head of the very important senate intelligence committee after two years of intensive study and access to intelligence that only they could get just stated that they have found no collusion between trump  russia now we find out that adam schiff was spending time together in aspen with glenn simpson of gps fusion who wrote the fake and discredited dossier even though simpson was testifying before schiff john solomon of  not only did senator burr's committee find no collusion by the trump campaign and russia it's important because they interviewed 200 witnesses and 300000 pages of documents  the committee has direct access to intelligence information that's classified  highly respected senator richard burr chairman of senate intelligence said today that after an almost two year investigation he saw no evidence of russia collusion we don't have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the trump campaign and russia  thank you so nice how well my state of the union speech was received thank you to all each year america pauses to remember its fallen astronaut heroes and the great accomplishments for which they strived  melania and i mourn their passing and take to heart the lessons of their lives and the greater human potential to which they continue to inspire  today it was my great honor to sign a presidential memorandum launching the women's global development and prosperity initiative  read more   2019 national prayer breakfast  presidential harassment it should never be allowed to happen again democrats at the top are killing the great state of virginia if the three failing pols were republicans far stronger action would be taken virginia will come back home republican in 2020 the dems and their committees are going nuts the republicans never did this to president obama there would be no time left to run government i hear other committee heads will do the same thing even stealing people who work at white house a continuation of witch hunt so now congressman adam schiff announces after having found zero russian collusion that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life both financial and personal even though there is no reason to be doing so never happened before unlimited presidential harassment rt    looking forward to tonight   melania and i send our greetings to those celebrating the lunar new year today people across the united states and around the world mark the beginning of the lunar new year with spectacular fireworks displays joyful festivals and family gatherings i see schumer is already criticizing my state of the union speech even though he hasn't seen it yet he's just upset that he didn't win the senate after spending a fortune like he thought he would too bad we weren't given more credit for the senate win by the media tremendous numbers of people are coming up through mexico in the hopes of flooding our southern border we have sent additional military we will build a human wall if necessary if we had a real wall this would be a non-event i am pleased to announce that david bernhardt acting secretary of the interior will be nominated as secretary of the interior david has done a fantastic job from the day he arrived and we look forward to having his nomination officially confirmed with caravans marching through mexico and toward our country republicans must be prepared to do whatever is necessary for strong border security dems do nothing if there is no wall there is no security human trafficking drugs and criminals of all dimensions keep out everyone is asking how tiger played yesterday the answer is great he was long straight  putted fantastically well he shot a 64 tiger is back  will be winning majors again not surprisingly jack also played really well his putting is amazing jack  tiger like each other with caravans marching through mexico and toward our country republicans must be prepared to do whatever is necessary for strong border security dems do nothing if there is no wall there is no security human trafficking drugs and criminals of all dimensionns keep out i will be interviewed sunday morning on  and prior to the super bowl on  at 3:30 pm enjoy ed gillespie who ran for governor of the great state of virginia against ralph northam must now be thinking malpractice and dereliction of duty with regard to his opposition research staff if they find that terrible picture before the election he wins by 20 points democrat governor ralph northam of virginia just stated i believe that i am not either of the people in that photo this was 24 hours after apologizing for appearing in the picture and after making the most horrible statement on super late term abortion unforgivable great morning at trump national golf club in jupiter florida with  and   national african american history month is an occasion to rediscover the enduring stories of african americans and the gifts of freedom purpose and opportunity they have bestowed on future generations thank you to senator rob portman and senator cory gardner for the early and warm endorsement we will all win in 2020 together great news on foxconn in wisconsin after my conversation with terry gou  jobs jobs jobs  best january for the dow in over 30 years we have by far the strongest economy in the world after 18 long years syria was loaded with isis until i came along we will soon have destroyed 100percent of the caliphate but will be watching them closely it is now time to start coming home and after many years spending our money wisely certain people must get smart i inherited a total mess in syria and afghanistan the endless wars of unlimited spending and death during my campaign i said very strongly that these wars must finally end we spend $50 billion a year in afghanistan and have hit them so hard that we are now talking peace this witch hunt must end  nellie ohr the wife of doj official bruce ohr was long ago investigating for pay gps fusion members of my family feeding it to her husband who was then giving it to the fbi even though it was created by ousted  discredited christopher steele illegal witch hunt just out the big deal very mysterious don jr telephone calls after the innocent trump tower meeting that the media  dems said were made to his father me were just conclusively found not to be made to me they were made to friends  business associates of don really sad our great us border patrol agents made the biggest fentanyl bust in our country's history thanks as always for a job well done i would suggest you read the complete testimony from tuesday a false narrative is so bad for our country i value our intelligence community happily we had a very good meeting and we are all on the same page just concluded a great meeting with my intel team in the oval office who told me that what they said on tuesday at the senate hearing was mischaracterized by the media and we are very much in agreement on iran isis north korea etc their testimony was distorted press  very sadly murder cases in mexico in 2018 rose 33percent from 2017 to 33341 this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crisis taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout our country worse even than afghanistan much caused by drugs wall is being built schumer and the democrats are big fans of being weak and passive with iran they have no clue as to the danger they would be inflicting on our country iran is in financial chaos now because of the sanctions and iran deal termination dems put us in a bad place but now good looking for china to open their markets not only to financial services which they are now doing but also to our manufacturing farmers and other us businesses and industries without this a deal would be unacceptable more troops being sent to the southern border to stop the attempted invasion of illegals through large caravans into our country we have stopped the previous caravans and we will stop these also with a wall it would be soooo much easier and less expensive being built democrats are becoming the party of late term abortion high taxes open borders and crime republicans on the homeland security committee are wasting their time democrats despite all of the evidence proof and caravans coming are not going to give money to build the desperately needed wall i've got you covered wall is already being built i don't expect much help china's representatives and i are trying to do a complete deal leaving nothing unresolved on the table all of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully resolved tariffs on china increase to 25percent on march 1st so all working hard to complete by that date meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in the oval office no final deal will be made until my friend president xi and i meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the long standing and more difficult points very comprehensive transaction china's top trade negotiators are in the us meeting with our representatives meetings are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides china does not want an increase in tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal they are correct i will be with murders up 33percent in mexico a record why wouldn't any sane person want to build a wall construction has started and will not stop until it is finished   very sadly murder cases in mexico in 2018 rose 33percent from 2017 to 33341 this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crises taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout our country worse even than afghanistan much caused by drugs wall is being built lets just call them walls from now on and stop playing political games a wall is a wall large sections of wall have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go renovation of existing walls is also a very big part of the plan to finally after many decades properly secure our border the wall is getting done one way or the other so great to watch  listen to all these people who write books  talk about my presidential campaign and so many others things related to winning and how i should be doing it as i take it all in i then sit back look around  say gee i'm in the white house  they're not large protests all across venezuela today against maduro the fight for freedom has begun spoke today with venezuelan interim president juan guaido to congratulate him on his historic assumption of the presidency and reinforced strong united states support for venezuela's fight to regain its democracy dow just broke 25000 tremendous news a source of potential danger and conflict they are testing rockets last week and more and are coming very close to the edge there economy is now crashing which is the only thing holding them back be careful of iran perhaps intelligence should go back to school the intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of iran they are wrong when i became president iran was making trouble all over the middle east and beyond since ending the terrible iran nuclear deal they are much different but three separate caravans marching to our border the numbers are tremendous  if the committee of republicans and democrats now meeting on border security is not discussing or contemplating a wall or physical barrier they are wasting their time time will tell what will happen with north korea but at the end of the previous administration relationship was horrendous and very bad things were about to happen now a whole different story i look forward to seeing kim jong un shortly progress being made-big difference fighting continues but the people of afghanistan want peace in this never ending war we will soon see if talks will be successful north korea relationship is best it has ever been with us no testing getting remains hostages returned decent chance of denuclearization when i became president isis was out of control in syria  running rampant since then tremendous progress made especially over last 5 weeks caliphate will soon be destroyed unthinkable two years ago negotiating are

the opposite we are not even into february and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18959495168 cost friday was $603331392 there are at least 25772342 illegal aliens not the 11000000 that have been reported for years in our country so ridiculous dhs 58000 non-citizens voted in texas with 95000 non-citizens registered to vote these numbers are just the tip of the iceberg all over the country especially in california voter fraud is rampant must be stopped strong voter id  rt  strong people stand up for themselvesbut stronger people stand up for othersthank you president  for stan witch hunt about all of the one sided fake media coverage collusion with crooked h that i had to endure during my very successful presidential campaign what about the now revealed bias by facebook and many others roger stone didn't even work for me anywhere near the election cbs reports that in the roger stone indictment data was released during the 2016 election to damage hillary clinton oh really what about the fake and unverified dossier a total phony conjob that was paid for by crooked hillary to damage me and the trump campaign what ax falls quickly at buzzfeed and huffpost headline new york post fake news and bad journalism have caused a big downturn sadly many others will follow the people want the truth only fools or people with a political agenda don't want a wall or steel barrier to protect our country from crime drugs and human trafficking it will happen it always does build a wall  crime will fall  we absolutely need a physical barrier or wall whatever you want to call it the president yesterday laid all that out we need to do it all including the wall i provided the same information to the previous administration  it was ignored mark morgan border chief for o thank you to the republican national committee the rnc who voted unanimously yesterday to support me in the upcoming 2020 election considering that we have done more than any administration in the first two years this should be easy more great things now in the works we have turned away at great expense two major caravans but a big one has now formed and is coming at least 8000 people if we had a powerful wall they wouldn't even try to make the long and dangerous journey build the wall and crime will fall 21 days goes very quickly negotiations with democrats will start immediately will not be easy to make a deal both parties very dug in the case for national security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the border  through dialogue we will build the wall i like the fact that the president is making the case border security  crime to the american people now we know where nancy pelosi chuck schumer  the democrats stand which is no border security will be big 2020 issue matt schlapp chair acu bigger than anyone knows if roger stone was indicted for lying to congress what about the lying done by comey brennan clapper lisa page  lover baker and soooo many others what about hillary to fbi and her 33000 deleted emails what about lisa  peter's deleted texts  wiener's laptop much more i wish people would read or listen to my words on the border wall this was in no way a concession it was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days if no deal is done it's off to the races greatest witch hunt in the history of our country no collusion border coyotes drug dealers and human traffickers are treated better who alerted cnn to be there a third rate conman who interviewed me many years ago for just a short period of time has been playing his biggest con of all on fake news cnn michael d'antonio a broken down hack who knows nothing about me goes on night after night telling made up trump stories disgraceful great earnings coming out of stock market too bad media doesn't devote much time to this nancy just said she just doesn't understand why very simply without a wall it all doesn't work our country has a chance to greatly reduce crime human trafficking gangs and drugs should have been done for decades we will not cave without a wall there cannot be safety and security at the border or for the usa build the wall and crime will fall back home where they belong no more rockets or m's being fired over japan or anywhere else and most importantly no nuclear testing this is more than has ever been accomplished with north korea and the fake news knows it i expect another good meeting soon much potential the fake news media loves saying so little happened at my first summit with kim jong un wrong after 40 years of doing nothing with north korea but being taken to the cleaners  with a major war ready to start in a short 15 months relationships built hostages  remains so interesting that bad lawyer michael cohen who sadly will not be testifying before congress is using the lawyer of crooked hillary clinton to represent him gee how did that happen remember july 4th weekend when crooked went before fbi  wasn't sworn in no tape nothing the economy is doing great more people working in usa today than at any time in our history media barely covers  this is everything fdr dreamed about the new deal to put america back to work think of lbj he gave people food stamps  welfare donald trump's giving them a job he's got a lot of good things to talk about news stories do not accurately cover him should correct  a great new book just out game of thorns by doug wead presidential historian and best selling author the book covers the campaign of 2016 and what could be more exciting than that alternative venue for the sotu address because there is no venue that can compete with the history tradition and importance of the house chamber i look forward to giving a great state of the union address in the near future as the shutdown was going on nancy pelosi asked me to give the state of the union address i agreed she then changed her mind because of the shutdown suggesting a later date this is her prerogative i will do the address when the shutdown is over i am not looking for an the historic results of president donald j trump's first two years in office  even trump haters like msnbc acknowledge you build a wall  crime will fall  the citizens of venezuela have suffered for too long at the hands of the illegitimate maduro regime today i have officially recognized the president of the venezuelan national assembly juan guaido as the interim president of venezuela  build a wall  crime will fall build a wall  crime will fall this is the new theme for two years until the wall is finished under construction now of the republican party use it and pray great unity in the republican party want to once and for all put an end to stoppable crime and drugs border security and wall no doubt deroy murdock national review we are now exporting oil which is the first time in my lifetime we are right now the largest producer of oil and gas this is not good if you're vladimir putin where your chief export is oil wh agent not good for kremlin  congratulations to mariano rivera on unanimously being elected to the national baseball hall of fame not only a great player but a great person i am thankful for mariano's support of the opioid drug abuse commission and   💯  big crooked hillary law firm represented by her lawyer michael sussmann do you believe this who worked baker hard  gave him oppo research for a russia probe this meeting now exposed is the subject of senate inquiries and much more an unconstitutional hoax  former fbi top lawyer james baker just admitted involvement in fisa warrant and further admitted there  were irregularities in the way the russia probe was handled they relied heavily on the unverified trump dossier paid for by the dnc  clinton campaign  funded through a the reason sarah sanders does not go to the podium much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely  inaccurately in particular certain members of the press i told her not to bother the word gets out anyway most will never cover us fairly  hence the term fake news the united states has a great economic story to tell number one in the world by far last time i went to davos the fake news said i should not go there this year because of the shutdown i decided not to go and the fake news said i should be there the fact is that the people understand the media better than the media understands them never seen  and republicans so united on an issue as they are on the humanitarian crisis  security on our southern border if we create a wall or barrier which prevents criminals and drugs from flowing into our country crime will go down by record numbers marist/npr/pbs poll shows president trump's approval rating among latinos going to 50percent an increase in one year of 19percent thank you working hard fbi top lawyer confirms unusual steps they relied on the clinton campaign's fake  unverified dossier which is illegal that has corrupted them that has enabled them to gather evidence by unconstitutional means and that's what they did to the president judge napolitano without a wall our country can never have border or national security with a powerful wall or steel barrier crime rates and drugs will go substantially down all over the us the dems know this but want to play political games must finally be done correctly no cave the democrats are playing politics with border security   nick sandmann and the students of covington have become symbols of fake news and how evil it can be they have captivated the attention of the world and i know they will use it for the good maybe even to bring people together it started off unpleasant but can end in a dream looking like nick sandman  covington catholic students were treated unfairly with early judgements proving out to be false smeared by media not good but making big comeback new footage shows that media was wrong about teen's encounter with native american  democrats are kidding themselves they don't really believe it if they say you can stop crime drugs human trafficking and caravans without a wall or steel barrier stop playing games and give america the security it deserves a humanitarian crisis four people in nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our country 26 people killed on the border in a drug and gang related fight two large caravans from honduras broke into mexico and are headed our way we need a powerful wall if nancy pelosi thinks that walls are immoral why isn't she requesting that we take down all of the existing walls between the us and mexico even the new ones just built in san diego at their very strong urging let millions of unchecked strangers just flow into the us china posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to us trade tensions and new policies makes so much sense for china to finally do a real deal and stop playing around today it was my great honor to visit the martin luther king jr memorial with  mike pence in honor of   democrats campaigned on working within washington and getting things done how is that working out  today we celebrate dr martin luther king jr for standing up for the self-evident truth americans hold so dear that no matter what the color of our skin or the place of our birth we are all created equal by god   last year was the best year for american manufacturing job growth since 1997 or 21 years the previous administration said manufacturing will not come back to the us you would need a magic wand i guess i found the magic wand and it is only getting better no president in modern times has kept more promises than donald trump thank you bill bennett  curt schilling deserves to be in the baseball hall of fame great record especially when under pressure and when it mattered most do what everyone in baseball knows is right  congratulations to bob kraft bill belichick tom brady and the entire new england patriots team on a great game and season will be a fantastic super bowl to all of the great people who are working so hard for your country and not getting paid i say thank you you are great patriots we must now work together after decades of abuse to finally fix the humanitarian criminal  drug crisis at our border we will win big a truly great first lady who doesn't get the credit she deserves  thanks james  will do a fantastic job  the media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with north korea think of where we were at the end of the obama administration compared to now great meeting this week with top reps looking forward to meeting with chairman kim at end of february thank you david  don't forget we are building and renovating big sections of wall right now moving quickly and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible building after all is what i do best even when money is not readily available wow just heard that my poll numbers with hispanics has gone up 19percent to 50percent that is because they know the border issue better than anyone and they want security which can only be gotten with a wall nancy i am still thinking about the state of the union speech there are so many options including doing it as per your written offer made during the shutdown security is no problem and my written acceptance while a contract is a contract i'll get back to you soon nancy pelosi has behaved so irrationally  has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a radical democrat she is so petrified of the lefties in her party that she has lost controland by the way clean up the streets in san francisco they are disgusting no amnesty is not a part of my offer it is a 3 year extension of daca amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal whether on immigration or something else likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11000000 plus people who are here illegally-but be careful nancy nancy pelosi and some of the democrats turned down my offer yesterday before i even got up to speak they don't see crime  drugs they only see 2020 which they are not going to win best economy they should do the right thing for the country  allow people to go back to work be careful and try staying in your house large parts of the country are suffering from  tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold amazing how big this system is wouldn't be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned global warming right now always heard that as president it's all about the economy well we have one of the best economies in the history of our country big gdp lowest unemployment companies coming back to the us in big numbers great new trade deals happening  more but little media mention i will be live from the white house at 4:00 pm mexico is doing nothing to stop the caravan which is now fully formed and heading to the united states we stopped the last two many are still in mexico but can't get through our wall but it takes a lot of border agents if there is no wall not easy many people are saying that the mainstream media will have a very hard time restoring credibility because of the way they have treated me over the past 3 years including the election lead-up as highlighted by the disgraceful buzzfeed story  the even more disgraceful coverage the economy is one of the best in our history with unemployment at a 50 year low and the stock market ready to again break a record set by us many times  all you heard yesterday based on a phony story was impeachment you want to see a stock market crash impeach trump  just stated that there has been no president since abraham lincoln who has been treated worse or more unfairly by the media than your favorite president me at the same time there has been no president who has accomplished more in his first two years in office will be leaving for dover to be with the families of 4 very special people who lost their lives in service to our country fake news is truly the enemy of the people remember it was buzzfeed that released the totally discredited dossier paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the democrats as opposition research on which the entire russian probe is based a very sad day for journalism but a great day for our country rt  by the time their fake news campaigns are fully exposed they've already moved on to their next fake news campaigna g rt  the buzzfeed bombshell bombed it blew up in their face and the rest of the fake news are casualties too rt  dear godthank you for answering our prayersa grateful nation🇺🇸   https:// just a son who loves his dad nice  i will be making a major announcement concerning the humanitarian crisis on our southern border and the shutdown tomorrow afternoon at 3 pm live from the  america first make america great again never seen the republican party so unified no cave on the issue of border and national security a beautiful thing to see especially when you hear the new rhetoric spewing from the mouths of the democrats who talk open border high taxes and crime stop criminals  drugs now kevin corke  don't forget michael cohen has already been convicted of perjury and fraud and as recently as this week the wall street journal has suggested that he may have stolen tens of thousands of dollars  lying to reduce his jail time watch father-in-law another big caravan heading our way very hard to stop without a wall it's the democrats keeping everything closed   so true why would nancy pelosi leave the country with other democrats on a seven day excursion when 800000 great people are not getting paid also could somebody please explain to nancy  her big donors in wine country that people working on farms grapes will have easy access in border rancher we've found prayer rugs out here it's unreal  washington examiner   people coming across the southern border from many countries some of which would be a big surprise gregg jarrett mueller's prosecutors knew the dossier was the product of bias and deception it was a fake just like so much news coverage in our country nothing but a witch hunt from beginning to end in 2018 alone 20000 illegal aliens with criminal records were apprehended trying to cross the border and there was a 122percent increase in fentanyl being smuggled between ports of entry last month alone more than 20000 minors were smuggled into the us  thank you to amy kremer women for trump co-founder for doing such a great interview with martha maccallumand by the way women have the lowest unemployment numbers in many decades at the highest pay ever proud of that so funny to watch schumer groveling he called for the firing of bad cop james comey many times until i fired him the left has become totally unhinged they no longer care what is right for our countrty it is becoming more and more obvious that the radical democrats are a party of open borders and crime they want nothing to do with the major humanitarian crisis on our southern border  there are now 77 major or significant walls built around the world with 45 countries planning or building walls over 800 miles of walls have been built in europe since only 2015 they have all been recognized as close to 100percent successful stop the crime at our southern border great being with the national champion clemson tigers last night at the white house because of the shutdown i served them massive amounts of fast food i paid over 1000 hamburgers etc within one hour it was all gone great guys and big eaters congratulations   why is nancy pelosi getting paid when people who are working are not great being with the national champion clemson tigers last night at the white

barrier will keep our country safe stop playing political games and end the shutdown volkswagen will be spending 800 million dollars in chattanooga tennessee they will be making electric cars congratulations to chattanooga and tennessee on a job well done a big win just announced that veterans unemployment has reached an 18 year low really good news for our vets and their families will

about lyin' james comey and the so-called leaders of the fbi twelve have been fired or forced to leave they got caught spying on my campaign and then called it an investigation bad i am doing exactly what i pledged to do and what i was elected to do by the citizens of our great country just as i promised i am fighting for you for decades politicians promised to secure the border fix our trade deals bring back our factories get tough on china move the embassy to jerusalem make nato pay their fair share and so much else only to do nothing or worse spoke w/ president erdogan of turkey to

potential to substantially expand getting ready to go on stage at the  in new orleans packed house i will try and match the great game played yesterday by the new orleans saints and their incredible qb drew brees people here are very excited by the team going on stage now  the fake news gets crazier and more dishonest every single day amazing to watch as certain people covering me and the tremendous success of this administration have truly gone mad their fake reporting creates anger and disunity take two weeks off and come back rested chill dems in puerto rico as shutdown hits day 24

15 minutes at this point it has become their and the democrats fault i've been waiting all weekend democrats must get to work now border must be secured gas prices drop across the united states because president trump has deregulated energy and we are now  producing a great deal more oil than ever before   but this is bad news for russia why would president trump do such a thing thought he worked for kremlin border is eventually going to be militarized and defended or the united states as we have known it is going to cease to existand americans will not go gentle into that good night patrick buchanan  the great people of our country demand proper border security now the trump portrait of an unsustainable border crisis is dead on in the last two years ice officers made 266000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of 100000 assaults 30000 sex crimes  4000 violent killings america's southern best line in the elizabeth warren beer catastrophe is to her husband thank you for being here i'm glad you're here it's their house he's supposed to be there if elizabeth warren often referred to by me as pocahontas did this commercial from bighorn or wounded knee instead of her kitchen with her husband dressed in full indian garb it would have been a smash  if elizabeth warren often referred to by me as pocahontas did this commercial from bighorn or wounded knee instead of her kitchen with her husband dressed in full indian garb it would have been a smash  so sorry to hear the news about jeff bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting i understand is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper the amazon washington post hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better  more responsible hands likewise do not want the kurds to provoke turkey russia iran and syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term us policy of destroying isis in syria natural enemies we also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home stop the endless wars starting the long overdue pullout from syria while hitting the little remaining isis territorial caliphate hard and from many directions will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms will devastate turkey economically if they hit kurds create 20 mile safe zone wish i could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the white house and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and rose garden really is something special country special place thousands of illegal aliens who have committed sexual crimes against children are right now in texas prisons most came through our southern border we can end this easily we need a steel barrier or wall walls work john jones texas department of public safety   the damage done to our country from a badly broken border drugs crime and so much that is bad is far greater than a shutdown which the dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to washington i'm in the white house waiting the democrats are everywhere but washington as people await their pay they are having fun and not even talking the building of the wall on the southern border will bring down the crime rate throughout the entire country democrats are saying that daca is not worth it and don't want to include in talks many hispanics will be coming over to the republican side watch i will be interviewed by jeanine pirro at 9:00 pm on  watch  before and  after all terrific people i am in the white house waiting for cryin' chuck and nancy to call so we can start helping our country both at the border and from within we have a massive humanitarian crisis at our southern border we will be out for a long time unless the democrats come back from their vacations and get back to work i am in the white house ready to sign i do have a plan on the shutdown but to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that i won the election and i promised safety and security for the american people part of that promise was a wall at the southern border elections have consequences i just watched a fake reporter from the amazon washington post say the white house is chaotic there does not seem to be a strategy for this shutdown there is no plan the fakes always like talking chaos there is none in fact there's almost nobody in the wh but me and democrats could solve the shutdown in 15 minutes call your dem senator or congresswoman/man tell them to get it done humanitarian crisis 23percent of federal inmates are illegal immigrants border arrests are up 240percent in the great state of texas between 2011  2018 there were a total of 292000 crimes by illegal aliens 539 murders 32000 assaults 3426 sexual assaults and 3000 weapons charges democrats come

lyin' james comey andrew mccabe peter s and his lover agent lisa page  more all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act these are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your president part of the witch hunt remember the insurance policy this is it i have been far tougher on russia than obama bush or clinton maybe tougher than any other president at the same time  as i have often said getting along with russia is a good thing not a bad thing i fully expect that someday we will have good relations with russia again who is being totally protected by his best friend bob mueller  the 13 angry democrats leaking machines who have no interest in going after the real collusion and much more by crooked hillary clinton her campaign and the democratic national committee just watch the fbi was in complete turmoil see ny post because of comey's poor leadership and the way he handled the clinton mess not to mention his usurpation of powers from the justice department my firing of james comey was a great day for america he was a crooked cop funny thing about james comey everybody wanted him fired republican and democrat alike after the rigged  botched crooked hillary investigation where she was interviewed on july 4th weekend not recorded or sworn in and where she said she didn't know anything a lie wow just learned in the failing new york times that the corrupt former leaders of the fbi almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons opened up an investigation on me for no reason  with no proof after i fired lyin' james comey a total sleaze  called a san diego news station  for negative reports on the wall when the station said that walls work cnn no longer had interest   drug prices declined in 2018 the first time in nearly half a century during the first 19 months of my administration americans saved $26 billion on prescription drugs our policies to get cheaper generic drugs to market are working i look forward to hosting right out of the great state of south carolina the 2019 ncaa football champion clemson tigers at the white house on monday january 14th what a game what a coach what a team the fake news media keeps saying we haven't built any new wall below is a section just completed on the border anti-climbing feature included very high strong and beautiful also many miles already renovated and in service  the steel barrier or wall should have been built by previous administrations long ago they never got it done i will without it our country cannot be safe criminals gangs human traffickers drugs  so much other big trouble can easily pour in it can be stopped cold humanitarian crisis at our southern border i just got back and it is a far worse situation than almost anyone would understand an invasion i have been there numerous times the democrats cryin' chuck and nancy don't know how bad and dangerous it is for our entire country h1-b holders in the united states can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay including a potential path to citizenship we want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the us i often said during rallies with little variation that mexico will pay for the wall we have just signed a great new trade deal with mexico it is billions of dollars a year better than the very bad nafta deal which it replaces the difference pays for wall many times over when i took the oath of office  we lose 300 americans a week 90percent of which comes through the southern border these numbers will be drastically reduced if we have a wall will be interviewed at the border by  on  tonight at 9:00 enjoy dear diary  from the southern border  because of the democrats intransigence on

to the  president obama thank you for your great support  i have been saying this all along  make america great again getting ready to leave for the great state of texas  great support for border security and the wall   even greater than anyone would know presidents supporters do not want him to cave  i won't there is great unity with the republicans in the house and senate despite the fake news media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise the opposition party  the dems know we must have strong border security but don't want to give trump another one of many wins cryin chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that i slammed the table  walked out of the room he had a temper tantrum because i knew he would say that and after nancy said no to proper border security i politely said bye-bye and left no slamming rt  just received my newest voter score tracking from my team  has reached his highest national approval rating gave an off the record luncheon somewhat of a white house tradition or custom to network anchors yesterday and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media which has gone totally bonkers the mainstream media has never been more dishonest than it is now nbc and msnbc are going crazy they report stories purposely the exact opposite of the facts they are truly the opposition party working with the dems may even be worse than fake news cnn if that is possible just left a meeting with chuck and nancy a total waste of time i asked what is going to happen in 30 days if i quickly open things up are you going to approve border security which includes a wall or steel barrier nancy said no i said bye-bye nothing else works thank you to all of america's brave police deputies sheriffs and federal law enforcement on national law enforcement appreciation day we love you and will always support you  billions of dollars are sent to the state

team a big win also for the great state of south carolina look forward to seeing the team and their brilliant coach for the second time at the wh talks with china are going very well the president is the biggest and best supporter of the steel industry in many years we are now doing really well the tariffs let us compete was unfair that the steel industry lost its jobs to unfair trade laws very positive outcome mark glyptis united steelworkers economic numbers looking really good can you imagine if i had long term zero interest rates to play with like the past administration rather than the rapidly raised normalized rates we have today that would have been so easy still markets up big since 2016 election endless wars especially those which are fought out of judgement mistakes that were made many years ago  those where we are getting little financial or military help from the rich countries that so greatly benefit from what we are doing will eventually come to a glorious end i am pleased to inform you that i will address the nation on the humanitarian and national security crisis on our southern border tuesday night at 9:00 pm eastern the failing new york times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on syria no different from my original statements we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight isis and doing all else that is prudent and necessary congressman adam smith the new chairman of the house armed services committee just stated yes there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency it's been done a number of times no doubt but let's get our deal done in congress the fake news media in our country is the real opposition party it is truly the enemy of the people we must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting the fake news will knowingly lie and demean in order make the tremendous success of the trump administration and me look as bad as possible they use non-existent sources  write stories that are total fiction our country is doing so well yet this is a sad day in america with all of the success that our country is having including the just released jobs numbers which are off the charts the fake news  totally dishonest media concerning me and my presidency has never been worse many have become crazed lunatics who have given up on the truth vp mike pence and group had a productive meeting with the schumer/pelosi representatives today many details of border security were discussed we are now planning a steel barrier rather than concrete it is both stronger  less obtrusive good solution and made in the usa our great military has delivered justice for the heroes lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the uss cole we have just killed the leader of that attack jamal al-badawi our work against al qaeda continues we will never stop in our fight against radical islamic terrorism excited to see our friends in egypt opening the biggest cathedral in the middle east president el-sisi is moving his country to a more inclusive future the only reason they do not want to build a wall is that walls work 99percent of our illegal border crossings will end crime in our country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year a properly planned and constructed wall will pay for itself many times a year we simply cannot allow people to pour into the united states undetected undocumented unchecked barrack obama 2005 i voted when i was a senator to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in hillary clinton 2015 will be going to camp david tomorrow morning for meetings on border security and many other topics with  senior staff ap-norc poll immigration among the top concerns in 2019 people want to stop drugs and criminals at the border want border security tell the dems to do the inevitable now rather than later the wait is costly and dangerous the number of employed americans has now set a 14th record under president trump over the year average hourly earnings have increased by 84 cents or 32percent participation rate hits trump-era high cns news  and we will do even better with new trade deals and all else jobs up big plus 312000 record number working manufacturing best in 20 years previous administration said this could not happen hispanic unemployment lowest ever dow plus 747 for day  vp mike pence and team just left the white house briefed me on their meeting with the schumer/pelosi representatives not much headway made today second meeting set for tomorrow after so many decades must finally and permanently fix the problems on the southern border drug makers and companies are not living up to their commitments on pricing not being fair to the consumer or to our country former  editor jill abramson rips paper's ‘unmistakably anti-trump' biasms abramson is 100percent correct horrible and totally dishonest reporting on almost everything they write hence the term fake news enemy of the people and opposition party great tweet today by tyler q houlton  on the  being put out by  a proud member of the opposition party  is doing a great job the democrats want billions of dollars for foreign aid but they don't want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our border figure that one out we are working hard at the border but we need a wall  in 2018 17 million pounds of narcotics seized 17000 adults arrested with criminal records and 6000 gang members including ms-13 apprehended a big human trafficking problem i don't care that most of the workers not getting paid are democrats i want to stop the shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on strong border security i am in the white house ready to go where are the dems many people currently a part of my opposition including president obama  the dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money these are civil cases they paid a fine  settled while no big deal i did not commit a campaign violation the democrats could solve the shutdown problem in a very short period of time all they have to do is approve real border security including a wall something which everyone other than drug dealers human traffickers and criminals want very badly this would be so easy to do great support coming from all sides for border security including wall on our very dangerous southern border teams negotiating this weekend washington post and nbc reporting of events including fake sources has been very inaccurate to put it mildly thank you to kanye west for your nice words criminal justice reform is now law passed in a very bipartisan way great new book by dr robert jeffress choosing the extraordinary life get it and enjoy   the story in the new york times regarding jim webb being considered as the next secretary of defense is fake news i'm sure he is a fine man but i don't know jim and never met him patrick shanahan who is acting secretary of defense is doing a great job job growth surges by 312000 in december  great jobs numbers just announced how do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time done nothing wrong no collusion with russia it was the dems that colluded had the most successful first two years of any president and is the most popular republican in party history 93percent as i have stated many times if the democrats take over the house or senate there will be disruption to the financial markets we won the senate they won the house things will settle down they only want to impeach me because they know they can't win in 2020 too much success president trump deserves a lot of credit but again you have the anti-trump people who are not going to give him a lot of credit michael pillsbury interviewed by  they have the motive of making the president look bad  instead of president trump being portrayed as a hero the first president to take china on it's 20 years overdue the rnc has a great chairwoman in ronna mcdaniel and the  has never been stronger we achieved historic wins with her help last year 🇺🇸 the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on at some point this had to be done the shutdown is only because of the 2020 presidential election the democrats know they can't win based on all of the achievements of trump so they are going all out on the desperately needed wall and border security and presidential harassment for them strictly politics maga list 205 ‘historic results' help trump make case for 2020 re-election  sadly there can be no real border security without the wall i remain ready and willing to work with democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders supports the agents and officers on the ground and keeps america safe let's get it done important meeting today on border security with republican and democrat leaders in congress both parties must work together to pass a funding bill that protects this nation and its people  this is the first and most important duty of government mexico is paying for the wall through the new usmca trade deal much of the wall has already been fully renovated or built we have done a lot of work $56 billion dollars that house has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of national security quick payback here we go with mitt romney but so fast question will be is he a flake  i hope not would much prefer that mitt focus on border security and so many other things where he can be helpful i won big and he didn't he should be happy for all republicans be a team player  win for far too long senate democrats have been obstructing more than 350 nominations these great americans left their jobs to serve our country but can't because dems are blocking them some for two years-historic record passed committees but schumer putting them on hold bad do you think it's just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut kim jong un says north korea will not make or test nuclear weapons or give them to others  he is ready to meet president trump anytime pbs news hour i also look forward to meeting with chairman kim who realizes so well that north korea possesses great economic potential washington examiner maga list 205 ‘historic results' help trump make case for 2020 re-election  true gas prices are low and expected to go down this year this would be good border security and the wall thing and shutdown is not where nancy pelosi wanted to start her tenure as speaker let's make a deal congratulations to president  who just made a great inauguration speech the usa is with you one thing has now been proven the democrats do not care about open borders and all of the crime and drugs that open borders bring general mcchrystal got fired like a dog by obama last assignment a total bust known for big dumb mouth hillary lover  the democrats much as i suspected have allocated no money for a new wall so imaginative the problem is without a wall there can be no real border security and our country must finally have a strong and secure southern border happy new year happy new year to everyone including the haters and the fake news media 2019 will be a fantastic year for those not suffering from trump derangement syndrome just calm down and enjoy the ride great things are happening for our country dr sebastian gorka a very good and talented guy has a great new book just out why we fight lots of insight enjoy remember this throughout the ages some things never get better and never change you have walls and you have wheels it was always that way and it will always be that way please explain to the democrats that there can never be a replacement for a good old fashioned wall the democrats will probably submit a bill being cute as always which gives everything away but gives nothing to border security namely the wall you see without the wall there can be no border security the tech stuff is just by comparison meaningless bells  whistles mexico is paying for the wall through the many billions of dollars a year that the usa is saving through the new trade deal the usmca that will replace the horrendous nafta trade deal which has so badly hurt our country mexico  canada will also thrive good for all happy new year  senator schumer more than a year longer than any other administration in history these are people who have been approved by committees and all others yet schumer continues to hold them back from serving their country very unfair heads of countries are calling wanting to know why senator schumer is not approving their otherwise approved ambassadors likewise in government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace 360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from it's incredible how democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a wall doesn't work it does and properly built almost 100percent they say it's old technology but so is the wheel they now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying i'm in the oval office democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security including the wall you voted yes in 2006 and 2013 one more yes but with me in office i'll get it built and fast i am the only person in america who could say that i'm bringing our great troops back home with victory and get bad press it is fake news and pundits who have failed for years that are doing the complaining if i stayed in endless wars forever they would still be unhappy i campaigned on border security which you cannot have without a strong and powerful wall our southern border has long been an open wound where drugs criminals including human traffickers and illegals would pour into our country dems should get back here an fix now except the results are far better than i ever said they were going to be i campaigned against the never ending wars remember i campaigned on getting out of syria and other places now when i start getting out the fake news media or some failed generals who were unable to do the job before i arrived like to complain about me  my tactics which are working just doing what i said i was going to do if anybody but donald trump did what i did in syria which was an isis loaded mess when i became president they would be a national hero isis is mostly gone we're slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families while at the same time fighting isis remnants an all concrete wall was never abandoned as has been reported by the media some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides makes sense to me i'm in the oval office democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security including the wall you voted yes in 2006 and 3013 one more yes but with me in office i'll get it built and fast president and mrs obama built/has a ten foot wall around their dc mansion/compound i agree totally necessary for their safety and security the us needs the same thing slightly larger version great work by my administration over the holidays to save coast guard pay during this  no thanks to the democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of americans veterans on president trump's handling of border security 62percent approval rating on being a strong leader 59percent  ap poll thank you it turns out to be true now that the department of justice and the fbi under president obama rigged the investigation for hillary and really turned the screws on trump and now it looks like in a corrupt  illegal way the facts are out now whole hoax exposed  absolutely nothing on russian collusion kimberley strassel the wall street journal the russian collusion fabrication is the greatest hoax in the history of american politics the only russian collusion was with hillary and the democrats 2018 is being called the year of the worker by steve moore co-author of trumponomics it was indeed a great year for the american worker with the best job market in 50 years and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and hispanics and all workers big wage gains for those that naively ask why didn't the republicans get approval to build the wall over the last year it is because in the senate we need 10 democrat votes and they will gives us none for border security now we have to do it the hard way with a shutdown too bad  children in question were very sick before they were given over to border patrol the father of the young girl said it was not their fault he hadn't given her water in days border patrol needs the wall and it will all end they are working so hard  getting so little credit any deaths of children or others at the border are strictly the fault of the democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally they can't if we had a wall they wouldn't even try the two just had a long and very good call with president xi of china deal is moving along very well if made it will be very comprehensive covering all subjects areas and points of dispute big progress being made i am in the white house waiting for the democrats to come on over and make a deal on border security from what i hear they are spending so much time on presidential harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military the mueller angry democrats recently deleted approximately 19000 text messages between fbi agent lisa page and her lover agent peter s these texts were asked for and invaluable to the truth of the witch hunt hoax this is a total obstruction of justice all texts demanded thank you to sean parnell for the nice comments on  about the troops wonderful reaction to melania and i in iraq and germany great things are happening honduras guatemala and el salvador are doing nothing for the united states but taking our money word is that a new caravan is forming in honduras and they are doing nothing about it we will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries taking advantage of us for years close the southern border bring our car industry back into the united states where it belongs go back to pre-nafta before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to mexico either we build finish the wall or we close the border the united states looses soooo much money on trade with mexico under nafta over 75 billion dollars a year not including drug money which would be many times that amount that i would consider closing the southern border a profit making operation we build a wall or we will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall  also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with hard to believe there was a congress  president who would approve cnn  others within the fake news universe were going wild about my signing maga hats for our military in iraq and germany if these brave young people ask me to sign their hat i will sign can you imagine my saying no we brought or gave no hats as the fake news first reported this isn't about the wall everybody knows that a wall will work perfectly in israel the wall works 999percent this is only about the dems not letting donald trump  the republicans have a win they may have the 10 senate votes but we have the issue border security 2020 brad blakeman the american people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them the president says look this is your neighborhood you've got to stand up to protect yourselves don't always look to america i totally agree  there is right now a full scale manhunt going on in california for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop time to get tough on border security build the wall border patrol agents want the wall democrat's say they don't want the wall even though they know it is really needed and they don't want ice they don't have much to campaign on do they an open southern border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity the reason the daca for wall deal didn't get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th circuit allowed daca to remain thereby setting up a supreme court case after ruling dems dropped deal and that's where we are today democrat obstruction of the needed wall the democrats obstruction of the desperately needed wall where they almost all recently agreed it should be built is exceeded only by their obstruction of 350 great people wanting  expecting to come into government after being delayed for more than two years a us record have the democrats finally realized that we desperately need border security and a wall on the southern border need to stop drugs human traffickinggang members  criminals from coming into our country do the dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are democrats just returned from visiting our troops in iraq and germany one thing is certain we have incredible people representing our country people that know how to win brad blakeman the american people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them the pesident says look this is your neighborhood you've got to stand up to protect yourselves don't always look to america the reason the daca for wall deal didn't get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th circuit allowed daca to remain thereby setting up a supteme court case after ruling dems dropped deal and that's where we are today democrat obstruction of the needed wall  melania and i were honored to visit our incredible troops at al asad air base in iraq god bless the usa  i hope everyone even the fake news media is having a great christmas our country is doing very well we are securing our borders making great new trade deals and bringing our troops back home we are finally putting america first merry christmas   merry christmas i am in the oval office  just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the wall in texas we are already building and renovating many miles of wall some complete democrats must end shutdown and finish funding billions of dollars  lives will be saved christmas eve briefing with my team working on north korea  progress being made looking forward to my next summit with chairman kim  i am all alone poor me in the white house waiting for the democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed border security at some point the democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our country more money than the border wall we are all talking about crazy saudi arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild syria instead of the united states see isn't it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a great country the us that is 5000 miles away thanks to saudi a the wall is different than the 25 billion dollars in border security the complete wall will be built with the shutdown money plus funds already in hand the reporting has been inaccurate on the point the problem is without the wall much of the rest of dollars are wasted i never lashed out at the acting attorney general of the us a man for whom i have great respect this is a made up story one of many by the fake news media the only problem our economy has is the fed they don't have a feel for the market they don't understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars or even democrat shutdowns over borders the fed is like a powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch he can't putt america is respected again for all of the sympathizers out there of brett mcgurk remember he was the obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 18 billion dollars in cash   sending it to iran as part of the horrific iran nuclear deal now terminated approved by little bob corker we are substantially subsidizing the militaries of many very rich countries all over the world while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the us and our taxpayers on trade general mattis did not see this as a problem i do and it is being fixed to those few senators who think i don't like or appreciate being allied with other countries they are wrong i do what i don't like however is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the united states both in military protection and trade virtually every democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a border wall or fence it was only when i made it an important part of my campaign because people and drugs were pouring into our country unchecked that they turned against it desperately needed president  of turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of isis in syriaand he is a man who can do it plus turkey is right next door our troops are coming home the president has been remarkable i do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is thank you to tammy bruce and steve hilton presidential harassment has been with me from the beginning the most important way to stop gangs drugs human trafficking and massive crime is at our southern border we need border security and as everyone knows you can't have border security without a wall the drones  technology are just bells and whistles safety for america mitch mcconnell just told a group of people and me that he has been in the us senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best  most productive of his career tax  regulation cuts va choice farm bill criminal justice reform judgeships  much more great it should not be the job of america to replace regimes around the world this is what president trump recognized in iraq that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades and he's rightthe generals still don't get the mistake   thanks   i am very proud of the president this is exactly what he promised and i think the people agree with him we've been at war too long and in too many placesspent several trillion dollars on these wars everywhere he's differentthat's why he got elected bob corker was responsible for giving us the horrible iran nuclear deal which i ended yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement i said no and the game was over  i love tennessee senator bob corker just stated that i'm so priveledged to serve in the senate for twelve years and that's what i told the people of our state that's what i'd do serve for two terms but that is not true wanted to run but poll numbers tanked when i wouldn't endorse him we signed two pieces of major legislation this week criminal justice reform and the farm bill these are two big deals but all the fake news media wants to talk about is the mistake of bringing our young people back home from the never ending wars it all began 19 years ago unthinkable devastation from the tsunami disaster in indonesia more than two hundred dead and nearly a thousand injured or unaccounted for we are praying for recovery and healing america is with you i just had a long and productive call with president  of turkey we discussed isis our mutual involvement in syria  the slow  highly coordinated pullout of us troops from the area after many years they are coming home we also discussed heavily expanded trade i am pleased to announce that our very talented deputy secretary of defense patrick shanahan will assume the title of acting secretary of defense starting january 1 2019 patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as deputy  previously boeing he will be great the only way to stop drugs gangs human trafficking criminal elements and much else from coming into our country is with a wall or barrier drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun but it is only a good old fashioned wall that works when president obama ingloriously fired jim mattis i gave him a second chance some thought i shouldn't i thought i should interesting relationship-but i also gave all of the resources that he never really had allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of us if anybody but your favorite president donald j trump announced that after decimating isis in syria we were going to bring our troops back home happy  healthy that person would be the most popular hero in america with me hit hard instead by the fake news media crazy brett mcgurk who i do not know was appointed by president obama in 2015 was supposed to leave in february but he just resigned prior to leaving grandstander the fake news is making such a big deal about this nothing event i will not be going to florida because of the shutdown staying in the white house   senate adjourns until december 27th i won an election said to be one of the greatest of all time based on getting out of endless  costly foreign wars  also based on strong borders which will keep our country safe we fight for the borders of other countries but we won't fight for the borders of our own the crisis of illegal activity at our southern border is real and will not stop until we build a great steel barrier or wall let work begin will be having lunch in white house residence with large group concerning border security going to be there for three months and that was seven years ago we never left when i became president isis was going wild now isis is largely defeated and other local countries including turkey should be able to easily take care of whatever remains we're coming home i am in the white house working hard news reports concerning the shutdown and syria are mostly fake we are negotiating with the democrats on desperately needed border security gangs drugs human trafficking  more but it could be a long stay on syria we were originally our great country must have border security  wishing supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg a full and speedy recovery some of the many bills that i am signing in the oval office right now cancelled my trip on air force one to florida while we wait to see if the democrats will help us to protect america's southern border  a design of our steel slat barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautiful  today it was my honor to sign into law hr 7213 the countering weapons of mass destruction act of 2018 the act redesignates the  domestic nuclear detection office as the countering weapons of mass destruction office read more   today it was my great honor to sign the  a monumental bi-partisan win for the american people  i've done more damage to isis than all recent presidentsnot even close the democrats now own the shutdown general anthony tata author dark winter i think the president is making the exact right move in syria all the geniuses who are protesting the withdrawal of troops from syria are the same geniuses who cooked the books on isis intelligence and gave rise to isis there has never been a president who has been tougher but fair on china or russia never just look at the facts the fake news tries so hard to paint the opposite picture thank you  for being willing to go with the so-called nuclear option in order to win on desperately needed border security have my total support mitch use the nuclear option and get it done our country is counting on you even president ronald reagan tried for 8 years to build a border wall or fence and was unable to do so others also have tried we will get it done one way or the other shutdown today if democrats do not vote for border security house republican vote 217-185 the democrats whose votes we need in the senate will probably vote against border security and the wall even though they know it is desperately needed if the dems vote no there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time people don't want open borders and crime no matter what happens today in the senate republican house members should be very proud of themselves they flew back to washington from all parts of the world in order to vote for border security and the wall not one democrat voted yes and we won big i am very proud of you on a border is only effective in conjunction with a wall properly designed and built walls work and the democrats are lying when they say they don't in israel the wall is 999percent successful will not be any different on our southern border hundreds of $billions saved the democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a wall calling it old fashioned the fact is there is nothing else's that will work and that has been true for thousands of years it's like the wheel there is nothing better i know tech better than anyone  technology senator mitch mcconnell should fight for the wall and border security as hard as he fought for anything he will need democrat votes but as shown in the house good things happen if enough dems don't vote it will be a democrat shutdown house republicans were great yesterday soon to be speaker nancy pelosi said last week live from the oval office that the republicans didn't have the votes for border security today the house republicans voted and won 217-185 nancy does not have to apologize all i want is great border security thank you to our great republican members of congress for your vote to fund border security and the wall the final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before so proud of you all now on to the senate equipment general mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations a new secretary of defense will be named shortly i greatly thank jim for his service general jim mattis will be retiring with distinction at the end of february after having served my administration as secretary of defense for the past two years during jim's tenure tremendous progress has been made especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting democrats it is time to come together and put the safety of the american people before politics border security must become a  priority  farm bill signing in 15 minutes    so hard to believe that lindsey graham would be against saving soldier lives  billions of $$$ why are we fighting for our enemy syria by staying  killing isis for them russia iran  other locals time to focus on our country  bring our youth back home where they belong congress just passed the criminal justice reform bill known as the  congratulations this is a great bi-partisan achievement for everybody when both parties work together we can keep our country safer a wonderful thing for the usa when i begrudgingly signed the omnibus bill i was promised the wall and border security by leadership would be done by end of year now it didn't happen we foolishly fight for border security for other countries but not for our beloved usa not good with so much talk about the wall people are losing sight of the great job being done on our southern border by border patrol ice and our great military remember the caravans well they didn't get through and none are forming or on their way border is tight fake news silent the democrats who know steel slats wall are necessary for border security are putting politics over country what they are just beginning to realize is that i will not sign any of their legislation including infrastructure unless it has perfect border security usa wins russia iran syria  many others are not happy about the us leaving despite what the fake news says because now they will have to fight isis and others who they hate without us i am building by far the most powerful military in the world isis hits us they are doomed does the usa want to be the policeman of the middle east getting nothing but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who in almost all cases do not appreciate what we are doing do we want to be there forever time for others to finally fight getting out of syria was no surprise i've been campaigning on it for years and six months ago when i very publicly wanted to do it i agreed to stay longer russia iran syria  others are the local enemy of isis we were doing there work time to come home  rebuild  i'm proud of the president today to hear that he is declaring victory in syria senator rand paul  i couldn't agree more with the presidents decision by definition this is the opposite of an obama decision senator mike lee trump gets no credit for what he's done in the middle east    so true thank you laura col jim carafano on  trump has made the middle east a better place when trump came into office isis was running amuck in the middle east over a million refugees poured into western europe none of that is happening today that's all due to trump after historic victories against isis it's time to bring our great young people home  in any event it goes on and on  the new ag who is now being replaced by yet another ag who openly campaigned on a get trump agenda does little else but rant rave  politic against me will never be treated fairly by these people a total double standard of justice sleazebag ag eric schneiderman who has since resigned over horrific women abuse when i wanted to close the foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics shady eric was head of new yorkers for clinton and refused to even look at the corrupt clinton foundation the trump foundation has done great work and given away lots of money both mine and others to great charities over the years with me taking no fees rent salaries etc now as usual i am getting slammed by cuomo and the dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by we have defeated isis in syria my only reason for being there during the trump presidency mexico is paying indirectly for the wall through the new usmca the replacement for nafta far more money coming to the us because of the tremendous dangers at the border including large scale criminal and drug inflow the united states military will build the wall in our country so much money has been poured down the drain for so many years but when it comes to border security and the military the democrats fight to the death we won on the military which is being completely rebuilt one way or the other we will win on the wall in our country so much money has been poured down the drain for so many years but the democrats fight us like cats and dogs when it comes to spending on boarder security including a wall and the military we won on the military it is being completely rebuilt we will win this will keep our communities safer and provide hope and a second chance to those who earn it in addition to everything else billions of dollars will be saved i look forward to signing this into law america is the greatest country in the world and my job is to fight for all citizens even those who have made mistakes congratulations to the senate on the bi-partisan passing of a historic criminal justice reform bill it will be beautiful and at the same time give our country the security that our citizens deserve it will go up fast and save us billions of dollars a month once completed the democrats are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a concrete wall but we are not building a concrete wall we are building artistically designed steel slats so that you can easily see through it congratulations to  on her appointment by governor  as the great new senator from arizona i have no doubt she will do a fantastic job president donald j trump's commission on school safety examined ways to make our schools safe for all students and teachers read more   michael isikoff was the first to report dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the dossier claims the whole russian collusion thing was a hoax but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed will never be proven and are likely false  thank you to michael isikoff yahoo for honesty what this means is that the fisa warrants and the whole russian witch hunt is a fraud and a hoax which should be ended immediately also it was paid for by crooked hillary  dnc russia dossier reporter now doubts dopey christopher steele's claims when you get into the details of the steele dossier the specific allegations we have not seen the evidence to support them there's good grounds to think that some of the more sensational allegations illegal immigration costs the united states more than 200 billion dollars a year how was this allowed to happen facebook twitter and google are so biased toward the dems it is ridiculous twitter in fact has made it much more difficult for people to join  they have removed many names  greatly slowed the level and speed of increase they have acknowledged-done nothing i hope the people over at the fed will read today's wall street journal editorial before they make yet another mistake also don't let the market become any more illiquid than it already is stop with the 50 b's feel the market don't just go by meaningless numbers good luck good luck today in court to general michael flynn will be interesting to see what he has to say despite tremendous pressure being put on him about russian collusion in our great and obviously highly successful political campaign there was no collusion biggest outrage yet in the long winding and highly conflicted mueller witch hunt is the fact that 19000 demanded text messages between peter strzok and his fbi lover lisa page were purposely  illegally deleted would have explained whole hoax which is now under protest today i am making good on my promise to defend our farmers  ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations i have authorized secretary perdue to implement the 2nd round of market facilitation payments our economy is stronger than everwe stand with our farmers anytime you hear a democrat saying that you can have good border security without a wall write them off as just another politician following the party line time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have at the same time far greater safety and control it is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation the outside world blowing up around us paris is burning and china way down the fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike take the victory the deductible which comes with obamacare is so high that it is practically not even useable hurts families badly we have a chance working with the democrats to deliver great healthcare a confirming supreme court decision will lead to great healthcare results for americans anytime you hear a democrat saying that you can have good boarder security without a wall write them off as just another politician following the party line time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have at the same time far greater safety and control the russian witch hunt hoax started as the insurance policy long before i even got elected is very bad for our country they are entrapping people for misstatements lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago nothing to do with collusion a democrat scam a persecution of the president  daniel henninger the wall street journal thank you people are starting to see and understand what this witch hunt is all about jeff sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total hoax to get started in the first place it looks here as though general flynn's defenses are incidental to something larger which is for the prosecution to figure out if it can find a path to donald trump without quite knowing what that crime might be it stops looking like prosecution and more looking like required television watching is last weeks  interview with the wonderful wife of rod blagojevich and the  interview with a jerome corsi if that doesn't tell you something about what has been going on in our country nothing will very sad the democrats policy of child seperation on the border during the obama administration was far worse than the way we handle it now remember the 2014 picture of children in cages the obama years however if you don't separate far more people will come smugglers use the kids judge ken starr former solicitor generel  independent counsel just stated that after two years there is no evidence or proof of collusion  further that there is no evidence that there was a campaign financing violation involving the president thank you judge  at the request of many i will be reviewing the case of a us military hero major matt golsteyn who is charged with murder he could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a terrorist bomb maker while overseas   remember michael cohen only became a rat after the fbi did something which was absolutely unthinkable  unheard of until the witch hunt was illegally started they broke into an attorney's office why didn't they break into the dnc to get the server or crooked's office so where are all the missing text messages between fired fbi agents peter s and the lovely lisa page his lover just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean what an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted witch hunt moves ever so slowly forward want them a real scandal is the one sided coverage hour by hour of networks like nbc  democrat spin machines like saturday night live it is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and dem commercials should be tested in courts can't be legal only defame  belittle collusion required television watching is last weeks  interview with the wonderful wife of  and the  interview with a jerome corsi if that doesn't tell you something about what has been going on in our country nothing will very sad wow 19000 texts between lisa page and her lover peter s of the fbi in charge of the russia hoax were just reported as being wiped clean and gone such a big story that will never be covered by the fake news witch hunt the pathetic and dishonest weekly standard run by failed prognosticator bill kristol who like many others never had a clue is flat broke and out of business too bad may it rest in peace never in the history of our country has the press been more dishonest than it is today stories that should be good are bad stories that should be bad are horrible many stories like with the real story on russia clinton  the dnc seldom get reported too bad the trump administration will be announcing the new secretary of the interior next week secretary of the interior  will be leaving the administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and i want to thank him for his service to our nation wow but not surprisingly obamacare was just ruled unconstitutional by a highly respected judge in texas great news for america as i predicted all along obamacare has been struck down as an unconstitutional disaster now congress must pass a strong law that provides great healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions mitch and nancy get it done for the record there were many people who wanted to be the white house chief of staff mick m will do a great job i look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to make america great again john will be staying until the end of the year he is a great patriot and i want to personally thank him for his service i am pleased to announce that mick mulvaney director of the office of management  budget will be named acting white house chief of staff replacing general john kelly who has served our country with distinction mick has done an outstanding job while in the administration thank you to  for agreeing to expand operations in the us and thereby creating thousands of jobs  kim jong un sees it better than anyone and will fully take advantage of it for his people we are doing just fine many people have asked how we are doing in our negotiations with north korea i always reply by saying we are in no hurry there is wonderful potential for great economic success for that country china just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our trade war with them they have just suspended us tariff hikes us is doing very well china wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal it could happen and rather soon china just announce the there economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our trade war with them they have just suspended us tariff hikes us is doing very well china wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal it could happen and rather soon let's not do a shutdown democrats do what's right for the american people  today it was my honor to welcome our nation's newly elected governors to the   happy 382nd birthday  our entire nation is forever grateful for all you do 24/7/365 we love you   just did an interview with  on  airing now 1pme enjoy she will probably be given a pass despite their terrible ratings congratulations to  our great ambassador to germany for having the courage to take this horrible issue on if it was a conservative that said what crazed mika brzezinski stated on her show yesterday using a certain horrible term that person would be banned permanently from television witch hunt they gave general flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated the fbi said he didn't lie and they overrode the fbi they want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements sad guilty even on a civil basis those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook as a lawyer michael has great liability to me stated that i did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws if they even apply because this was not campaign finance cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me but he plead to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not i never directed michael cohen to break the law he was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law it is called advice of counsel and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made that is why they get paid despite that many campaign finance lawyers have strongly i often stated one way or the other mexico is going to pay for the wall this has never changed our new deal with mexico and canada the usmca is so much better than the old very costly  anti-usa nafta deal that just by the money we save mexico is paying for the wall guilty even on a civil bases those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook as a lawyer michael has great liability to me  melania will be interviewed by  tonight on  at 9:00pme the democrats and president obama gave iran 150 billion dollars and got nothing but they can't give 5 billion dollars for national security and a wall another very bad terror attack in france we are going to strengthen our borders even more chuck and nancy must give us the votes to get additional border security thanks to leader mcconnell for agreeing to bring a senate vote on criminal justice this week these historic changes will make communities safer and save tremendous taxpayers dollars it brings much needed hope to many families during the holiday season i don't care what you think of the presidentit cannot bleed over to the fbicomey is confirming there is bias in the fbi -chris swecker james comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow democrats to take back the white house in 2020 in other words he is and has been a democrat comey had no right heading the fbi at any time but especially after his mind exploded fake news has it purposely wrong many over ten are vying for and wanting the white house chief of staff position why wouldn't someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in washington please report news correctly thank you very productive conversations going on with china watch for some important announcements great job by michael anton on  a true national security expert people do not yet realize how much of the wall including really effective renovation has already been built if the democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country the military will build the remaining sections of the wall they know how important it is i look forward to my meeting with chuck schumer  nancy pelosi in 2006 democrats voted for a wall and they were right to do so today they no longer want border security they will fight it at all cost and nancy must get votes for speaker but the wall will get built however for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left do not want border security they want open borders for anyone to come in this brings large scale crime and disease our southern border is now secure and will remain that way ice border patrol and our military have done a fantastic job of securing our southern border a great wall would be however a far easier  less expensive solution we have already built large new sections  fully renovated others making them like new the democrats despite the large caravans that were forming and heading to our country people have not been able to get through our newly built walls makeshift walls  fences or border patrol officers  military they are now staying in mexico or going back to their original countries former fbi director james comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the democrats paid for that phony trump dossier   details on tuesday night james comey's behind closed doors testimony reveals that there was not evidence of campaign collusion with russia when he left the fbi in other words the witch hunt is illegal and should never have been started which it was not but even if it was it is only a civil case like obama's but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine lawyer's liability if he made a mistake not me cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced witch hunt democrats can't find a smocking gun tying the trump campaign to russia after james comey's testimony no smocking gunno collusion   that's because there was no collusion so now the dems go to a simple private transaction wrongly call it a campaign contribution i am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of white house chief of staff fake news has been saying with certainty it was nick ayers a spectacular person who will always be with our  agenda i will be making a decision soon the trump administration has accomplished more than any other us administration in its first two not even years of existence  we are having a great time doing it all of this despite the fake news media which has gone totally out of its mind-truly the enemy of the people leakin' james comey must have set a record for who lied the most to congress in one day his friday testimony was so untruthful this whole deal is a rigged fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that i could not become president they are now exposed on 245  occasions former fbi director james comey told house investigators he didn't know didn't recall or couldn't remember things when asked opened investigations on 4 americans not 2 didn't know who signed off and didn't know christopher steele all lies it was my honor to attend today's  in philadelphia a great game played all around by our heroes congratulations  on the win  🇺🇸  great honor to be headed to the army-navy game today will be there shortly landing now  left and right he then woke up from his dream screaming that he lied next time i go to vietnam i will ask the dick to travel with me watched da nang dick blumenthal on television spewing facts almost as accurate as his bravery in vietnam which he never saw as the bullets whizzed by da nang dicks head as he was saving soldiers very sad day  night in paris maybe it's time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive paris agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes the us was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year this is collusion illusion there is no smoking gun here at this late date after all that we have gone through after millions have been spent we have no russian collusion there is nothing impeachable here   time for the witch hunt to end i am thankful to both of these incredible men for their service to our country date of transition to be determined i am pleased to announce my nomination of four-star general mark milley chief of staff of the united states army  as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff replacing general joe dunford who will be retiring after two years and millions of pages of documents and a cost of over $30000000 no collusion the idea of a european military didn't work out too well in ww i or 2 but the us was there for you and always will be all we ask is that you pay your fair share of nato germany is paying 1percent while the us pays 43percent of a much larger gdp to protect europe fairness the paris agreement isn't working out so well for paris protests and riots all over france people do not want to pay large sums of money much to third world countries that are questionably run in order to maybe protect the environment chanting we want trump love france totally clears the president thank you it is being reported that leakin' james comey was told by department of justice attorneys not to answer the most important questions total bias and corruption at the highest levels of previous administration force him to answer the questions under oath hopefully mitch mcconnell will ask for a vote on criminal justice reform it is extremely popular and has strong bipartisan support it will also help a lot of people save taxpayer dollars and keep our communities safe go for it mitch mike pompeo is doing a great job i am very proud of him his predecessor rex tillerson didn't have the mental capacity needed he was dumb as a rock and i couldn't get rid of him fast enough he was lazy as hell now it is a whole new ballgame great spirit at state and one of the most highly respected lawyers and legal minds in the country he will be a great addition to our team i look forward to having him join our very successful administration i am pleased to announce that i will be nominating the honorable william p barr for the position of attorney general of the united states as the former ag for george hw bush i am pleased to announce that heather nauert spokeswoman for the united states department of state will be nominated to serve as united nations ambassador i want to congratulate heather and thank ambassador nikki haley for her great service to our country we will be doing a major counter report to the mueller report this should never again be allowed to happen to a future president of the united states today we honor those who perished 77 years ago at pearl harbor and we salute every veteran who served in world war ii over the 4 years that followed that horrific attack god bless america   it has been incorrectly reported that rudy giuliani and others will not be doing a counter to the mueller report that is fake news already 87 pages done but obviously cannot complete until we see the final witch hunt report china talks are going very well the lying and leaking by the people doing the report  also bruce ohr and his lovely wife molly comey brennan clapper  all of the many fired people of the fbi be listed in the report will the corruption within the dnc  clinton campaign be exposedand so much more foundation be listed at the top of the report will the scathing document written about lyin' james comey by the man in charge of the case rod rosenstein who also signed the fisa warrant be a big part of the report isn't rod therefore totally conflicted will all of overturned 9-0 in the united states supreme court doing same thing to people now will all of the substantial  many contributions made by the 17 angry democrats to the campaign of crooked hillary be listed in top of report will the people that worked for the clinton will robert mueller's big time conflicts of interest be listed at the top of his republicans only report will andrew weissman's horrible and vicious prosecutorial past be listed in the report he wrongly destroyed people's lives took down great companies only to be robert mueller and leakin' lyin' james comey are best friends just one of many mueller conflicts of interest and bye the way wasn't the woman in charge of prosecuting jerome corsi who i do not know in charge of legal at the corrupt clinton foundation a total witch hunt arizona together with our military and border patrol is bracing for a massive surge at a non-walled area we will not let them through big danger nancy and chuck must approve boarder security and the wall fake news the enemy of the people trish_regan  did the fbi follow protocol to obtain the fisa warrant i don't think so the dossier was opposition research funded by opponents don't use government resources to take down political foes weaponizing government for gain is this really america witch hunt jerome corsi this is not justice this is not america this is a political prosecution the special prosecutor counsel to get this plea deal demanded i lie and violate the law they're the criminals he is not alone 17 angry dems people forced to lie sad   statement from china the teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other we are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days i agree does the fake news media ever mention the fact that republicans with the very important help of my campaign rallies won the united states senate 53 to 47 all i hear is that the open border dems won the house senate alone approves judges  others big republican win my thoughts and prayers are with the  crew members who were involved in a mid-air collision off the coast of japan thank you to  for their immediate response and rescue efforts whatever you need we are here for you  without the phony russia witch hunt and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years tax  regulation cuts judge's military vets etc my approval rating would be at 75percent rather than the 50percent just reported by rasmussen it's called presidential harassment working hard thank you  doug wead a truly great presidential historian had a wonderful take on a very beautiful moment in history the funeral service today of president bush doug was able to brilliantly cover some very important and interesting periods of time  hopefully opec will be keeping oil flows as is not restricted the world does not want to see or need higher oil prices looking forward to being with the bush family this is not a funeral this is a day of celebration for a great man who has led a long and distinguished life he will be missed considered to be the worst and most dangerous addictive and deadly substance of them all last year over 77000 people died from fentanyl if china cracks down on this horror drug using the death penalty for distributors and pushers the results will be incredible one of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with president xi of china is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly fentanyl coming into the united states it will now be considered a controlled substance this could be a game changer on what is very strong signals being sent by china once they returned home from their long trip including stops from argentina not to sound naive or anything but i believe president xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting all subjects discussed china had agreed to start immediately buying us products  china officially echoed president donald trump's optimism over bilateral trade talks chinese officials have begun preparing to restart imports of us soybeans  liquified natural gas the first sign confirming the claims of president donald trump and the white house that china does not want tariffs we are either going to have a real deal with china or no deal at all at which point we will be charging major tariffs against chinese product being shipped into the united states ultimately i believe we will be making a deal either now or into the future in the world i want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving america's environment but american taxpayers  and american workers  shouldn't pay to clean up others countries' pollution i am glad that my friend  and the protestors in paris have agreed with the conclusion i reached two years ago the paris agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters could somebody please explain to the democrats we need their votes that our country losses 250 billion dollars a year on illegal immigration not including the terrible drug flow top border security including a wall is $25 billion pays for itself in two months get it done but if a fair deal is able to be made with china one that does all of the many things we know must be finally done i will happily sign let the negotiations begin make america great again i am a tariff man when people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our nation i want them to pay for the privilege of doing so it will always be the best way to max out our economic power we are right now taking in $billions in tariffs make america rich again on seeing whether or not a real deal with china is actually possible if it is we will get it done china is supposed to start buying agricultural product and more immediately president xi and i want this deal to happen and it probably will but if not remember the negotiations with china have already started unless extended they will end 90 days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with president xi in argentina bob lighthizer will be working closely with steve mnuchin larry kudlow wilbur ross and peter navarro looking forward to being with the wonderful bush family at blair house today the former first lady will be coming over to the white house this morning to be given a tour of the christmas decorations by melania the elegance  precision of the last two days have been remarkable   congratulations to newly inaugurated mexican president  he had a tremendous political victory with the great support of the mexican people we will work well together for many years to come looking forward to being with the bush family to pay my respects to president george hw bush bob mueller who is a much different man than people think and his out of control band of angry democrats don't want the truth they only want lies the truth is very bad for their mission i will never testify against trump this statement was recently made by roger stone essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about president trump nice to know that some people still have guts his wife and father-in-law who has the money off scott free he lied for this outcome and should in my opinion serve a full and complete sentence michael cohen asks judge for no prison time you mean he can do all of the terrible unrelated to trump things having to do with fraud big loans taxis etc and not serve a long prison term he makes up stories to get a great  already reduced deal for himself and get we would save billions of dollars if the democrats would give us the votes to build the wall either way people will not be allowed into our country illegally we will close the entire southern border if necessary also stop the drugs i am certain that at some time in the future president xi and i together with president putin of russia will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable arms race the us spent 716 billion dollars this year crazy president xi and i have a very strong and personal relationship he and i are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change on trade and far beyond between our two great nations a solution for north korea is a great thing for china and all farmers will be a a very big and fast beneficiary of our deal with china they intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately we make the finest and cleanest product in the world and that is what china wants farmers i love you my meeting in argentina with president xi of china was an extraordinary one relations with china have taken a big leap forward very good things will happen we are dealing from great strength but china likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed level the field china has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into china from the us currently the tariff is 40percent this week jews around the world will celebrate the miracles of hanukkah  melania and i send our very best wishes for a blessed and happy hanukkah   however out of respect for the bush family and former president george hw bush we will wait until after the funeral to have a press conference i was very much looking forward to having a press conference just prior to leaving argentina because we have had such great success in our dealing with various countries and their leaders at the g20 president george hw bush led a long successful and beautiful life  whenever i was with him i saw his absolute joy for life and true pride in his family his accomplishments were great from beginning to end he was a truly wonderful man and will be missed by all statement from president donald j trump and first lady melania trump on the passing of former president george hw bush  watch  on  now enjoy great day at the  in buenos aires argentina thank you
