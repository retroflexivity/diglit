ever for black and hispanic and all worker big wage gain for those that naively ask why do n't the republicans get approval to build the wall over the last year it be because in the senate we need 10 democrat vote and they will give we none for border security now we have to do it the hard way with a shutdown too bad   child in question be very sick before they be give over to border patrol the father of the young girl say it be not their fault he have n't give she water in day border patrol need the wall and it will all end they be work so hard   get so little credit any death of child or

loose soooo much money on trade with mexico under nafta over 75 billion dollar a year not include drug money which would be many time that amount that I would consider close the southern border a profit make operation we build a wall or we will be force to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist democrats do not give we the money to finish the wall   also change the ridiculous immigration law that our country be saddle with hard to believe there be a congress   president who would approve cnn   other within the fake news universe be go wild about my signing maga hat for our

time these country take total advantage of the us and our taxpayer on trade general mattis do not see this as a problem I do and it be be fix to those few senator who think I do n't like or appreciate be ally with other country they be wrong I do what I do n't like however be when many of these same country take advantage of their friendship with the united states both in military protection and trade virtually every democrat we be deal with today strongly support a border wall or fence it be only when I make it an important part of my campaign because people and drug be pour into our country unchecked that they turn against it desperately need president   of turkey have very strongly inform I that he will eradicate whatever be leave of isis in syriaand he be a man who can do it plus turkey be right next door our troop be come home the president have be remarkable I do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment and he will be a constant reminder of what populism be

border we need border security and as everyone know you ca n't have border security without a wall the drone   technology be just bell and whistle safety for america mitch mcconnell just tell a group of people and I that he have be in the us senate for 32 year and the last two have be by far the good   most productive of his career tax   regulation cut va choice farm bill criminal justice reform judgeship   much more great it should not be the job of america to replace regime around the world this be what president trump recognize in iraq that it be the big foreign policy disaster of the last several decade and he be rightthe general still do n't get the mistake    thank    I be very proud of the president this be exactly what he promise and I think the people agree with he we 've be at

which I end yet he badmouth I for want to bring our young people safely back home bob want to run and ask for my endorsement I say no and the game be over   I love tennessee senator bob corker just state that I be so priveledged to serve in the senate for twelve year and that be what I tell the people of our state that be what I 'd do serve for two term but that be not true want to run but poll number tank when I would n't endorse he we sign two piece of major legislation this week criminal justice reform and the farm bill these be two big deal but all the fake news medium want to talk about

be only a good old fashioned wall that work when president obama ingloriously fire jim mattis I give he a second chance some think I should n't I think I should interesting relationship - but I also give all of the resource that he never really have ally be very important - but not when they take advantage of we if anybody but your favorite president donald j trump announce that after decimate isis in syria we be go to bring our troop back home happy   healthy that person would be the most popular hero in america with I hit hard instead by the fake news medium crazy brett mcgurk who I do

import of we soybean   liquify natural gas the first sign confirm the claim of president donald trump and the white house that china do not want tariff we be either go to have a real deal with china or no deal at all at which point we will be charge major tariff against chinese product be ship into the united states ultimately I believe we will be make a deal either now or into the future in the world I want clean air and clean water and have be make great stride in improve america 's environment but american taxpayer   and american worker   should n't pay to clean up other country ' pollution I be glad that my friend   and the protestor in paris have agree with the conclusion I reach two year ago the paris agreement be fatally flawed because it raise the price of energy for

bad for their mission I will never testify against trump this statement be recently make by roger stone essentially state that he will not be force by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lie and story about president trump nice to know that some people still have gut his wife and father - in - law who have the money off scott free he lie for this outcome and should in my opinion serve

prison term he make up story to get a great   already reduce deal for himself and get we would save billion of dollar if the democrats would give we the vote to build the wall either way people will
