worked so well together in crafting this great document the terrible nafta will soon be gone the usmca will be fantastic for all 🇺🇸🇲🇽🇨🇦  lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in russia put up zero money zero guarantees and didn't do the project witch hunt oh i get it i am a very good developer happily living my life when i see our country going in the wrong direction to put it mildly against all odds i decide to run for president  continue to run my business-very legal  very cool talked about it on the campaign trail arrived in argentina with a very busy two days planned important meetings scheduled throughout our great country is extremely well represented will be very productive alan dershowitz these are not crimes he mueller has no authority to be a roving commissioner i don't see any evidence of crimes  this is an illegal hoax that should be ended immediately mueller refuses to look at the real crimes on the other side where is the ig report this demonstrates the robert mueller and his partisans have no evidence not a whiff of collusion between trump and the russians russian project legal trump tower meeting son don perfectly legal he wasn't involved with hacking     gregg jarrett  a total witch hunt just landed in argentina with  melania   as rnc chair ronna mcdaniel oversaw history defying gains in the senate and unprecedented fundraising strength i have asked her to serve another term for my 2020 re-elect because there is no one better for the job we have been working hard on this and it's only going to get better  with all of the new books coming out you can't forget two of the great originals written by  and  pirro their books both went to  go get them now the phony witch hunt is well explained  new book spygate the attempted sabotage of donald j trump is terrific he's tough he's smart and he really gets it his book is on sale now i highly recommend they have really done a great job in capturing my long-held views and ideas this book is on sale now a terrific read of a really interesting subject  and arthur laffer two very talented men have just completed an incredible book on my economic policies or as they call it   has written an absolutely fascinating book back in the game on the world of dc politics and more he has experienced so much in a short period of time few people have had his bravery or courage and he has come all the way back a big power and great person in argentina with president vladimir putin i look forward to a meaningful summit again as soon as this situation is resolved based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to ukraine from russia i have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting billions of dollars are pouring into the coffers of the usa because of the tariffs being charged to china and there is a long way to go if companies don't want to pay tariffs build in the usa otherwise lets just make our country richer than ever before when will this illegal joseph mccarthy style witch hunt one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever end-or will it just go on forever after wasting more than $40000000 is that possible it has proven only one thing-there was no collusion with russia so ridiculous did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime at the same time mueller and the angry democrats aren't even looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed by crooked hillary clinton and the democrats a total disgrace general motors is very counter to what other auto and other companies are doing big steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country auto companies are pouring into the us including bmw which just announced a major new plant the usa is booming so much happening with the now discredited witch hunt this total hoax will be studied for years sebastian gorka a very talented man who i got to know well while he was working at the white house has just written an excellent book why we fight much will be learned from this very good read on behalf of  melania and the entire trump family i want to wish you all a very merry christmas may this christmas season bring peace to your hearts warmth to your homes cheer to your spirits and joy to the world 🎄  steel dynamics announced that it will build a brand new 3 million ton steel mill in the southwest that will create 600 good-paying us jobs steel jobs are coming back to america just like i predicted congratulations to steel dynamics and gm would not be closing their plants in ohio michigan  maryland get smart congress also the countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the us for decades the president has great power on this issue because of the gm event it is being studied now the reason that the small truck business in the us is such a go to favorite is that for many years tariffs of 25percent have been put on small trucks coming into our country it is called the chicken tax if we did that with cars coming in many more cars would be built here while the disgusting fake news is doing everything within their power not to report it that way at least 3 major players are intimating that the angry mueller gang of dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts  they will get relief this is our joseph mccarthy era congratulations to senator cindy hyde-smith on your big win in the great state of mississippi we are all very proud of you brenda snipes in charge of voting in broward county florida was just spotted wearing a beautiful dress with 300 i voted signs on it just kidding she is a fine very honorable and highly respected voting tactician the mueller witch hunt is a total disgrace they are looking at supposedly stolen crooked hillary clinton emails even though they don't want to look at the dnc server but have no interest in the emails that hillary deleted  acid washed after getting a congressional subpoena for electric cars general motors made a big china bet years ago when they built plants there and in mexico don't think that bet is going to pay off i am here to protect america's workers very disappointed with general motors and their ceo mary barra for closing plants in ohio michigan and maryland nothing being closed in mexico  china the us saved general motors and this is the thanks we get we are now looking at cutting all  subsidies including polls are open in mississippi we need cindy hyde-smith in washington go out and vote thanks terrible gang of angry democrats look at their past and look where they come from the now $30000000 witch hunt continues and they've got nothing but ruined lives where is the server let these terrible people go back to the clinton foundation and justice department the fake news media builds bob mueller up as a saint when in actuality he is the exact opposite he is doing tremendous damage to our criminal justice system where he is only looking at one side and not the other heroes will come of this and it won't be mueller and his the phony witch hunt continues but mueller and his gang of angry dems are only looking at one side not the other wait until it comes out how horribly  viciously they are treating people ruining lives for them refusing to lie mueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue starts today election is on december 4th  is tough on crime and borders loves our military and vets he will be great for jobs brad raffensperger will be a fantastic secretary of state for georgia will work closely with  it is really important that you get out and vote for brad early voting and false way something has to be done including the possibility of the united states starting our own worldwide network to show the world the way we really are great while cnn doesn't do great in the united states based on ratings outside of the us they have very little competition throughout the world cnn has a powerful voice portraying the united states in an unfair on the ten-year anniversary of the mumbai terror attack the us stands with the people of india in their quest for justice the attack killed 166 innocents including six americans we will never let terrorists win or even come close to winning hundreds of people closely involved with my campaign who never met saw or spoke to a russian during this period so many campaign workers people inside from the beginning ask me why they have not been called they want to be there was no collusion  mueller knows it when mueller does his final report will he be covering all of his conflicts of interest in a preamble will he be recommending action on all of the crimes of many kinds from those on the other sidewhatever happened to podesta and will he be putting in statements from mexico should move the flag waving migrants many of whom are stone cold criminals back to their countries do it by plane do it by bus do it anyway you want but they are not coming into the usa we will close the border permanently if need be congress fund the wall children from parents as did bush etc because that is the policy and law i tried to keep them together but the problem is when you do that vast numbers of additional people storm the border so with obama seperation is fine but with trump it's not fake 60 minutes  did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the obama administration in fact a picture of children in jails was used by other fake media to show how bad cruel we are but it was in 2014 during o years obama separated clinton foundation donations drop 42percent which shows that they illegally played the power game they monetized their political influence through the foundation during her tenure the state department was put in the service of the clinton foundation  andrew mccarthy europe has to pay their fair share for military protection the european union for many years has taken advantage of us on trade and then they don't live up to their military commitment through nato things must change fast general anthony tata president trump is a man of his word  he said he was going to be tough on the border and he is tough on the border he has rightfully strengthened the border in the face of an unprecedented threat it's the right move by president trump thanks general mississippi vote for  on tuesday respected by all we need her in washington thanks so great that oil prices are falling thank you president t add that which is like a big tax cut to our other good economic news inflation down are you listening fed would be very smart if mexico would stop the caravans long before they get to our southern border or if originating countries would not let them form it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in us no longer dems created this problem no crossings the large and violent french protests don't take into account how badly the united states has been treated on trade by the european union or on fair and reasonable payments for our great military protection both of these topics must be remedied soon i will be in gulfport and tupelo mississippi on monday night doing two rallies for senator hyde-smith who has a very important election on tuesday she is an outstanding person who is strong on the border crime military our great vets healthcare  the 2nd a needed in dc victor davis hanson was a very good and interesting guest of mark levin on  he wrote a highly touted book called the second world wars and a new book will soon be coming out called the case for trump recommend both  all will stay in mexico if for any reason it becomes necessary we will close our southern border there is no way that the united states will after decades of abuse put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore migrants at the southern border will not be allowed into the united states until their claims are individually approved in court we only will allow those who come into our country legally other than that our very strong policy is catch and detain no releasing into the us i am extremely happy and proud of the job being done by  secretary  the fake news likes to write stories to the contrary quoting phony sources or jealous people but they aren't true they never like to ask me for a quote b/c it would kill their story really good criminal justice reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support  mitch mcconnell and  have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country already passed with big vote in house would be a major victory for all really good criminal justice reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support  mitch mcconnell and  have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country already past with big vote in house would be a major victory for all republicans and democrats must come together finally with a major border security package which will include funding for the wall after 40 years of talk it is finally time for action fix the border for once and for all now our highly trained security professionals are not allowed to do their job on the border because of the judicial activism and interference by the 9th circuit nevertheless they are working hard to make america a safer place though hard to do when anybody filing a lawsuit wins this is the coldest weather in the history of the thanksgiving day parade in nyc and one of the coldest thanksgivings on record will be speaking with our great military in different parts of the world through teleconference at 9:00 am eastern then it will be off to see our coast guard patriots  to thank them for the great job they have been doing especially with the hurricanes happy thanksgiving and safety at the border or anywhere else they know nothing about it and are making our country unsafe our great law enforcement professionals must be allowed to do their job if not there will be only bedlam chaos injury and death we want the constitution as written justice roberts can say what he wants but the 9th circuit is a complete  total disaster it is out of control has a horrible reputation is overturned more than any circuit in the country 79percent  is used to get an almost guaranteed result judges must not legislate security happy thanksgiving to all it's a mean  nasty world out there the middle east in particular this is a long and historic commitment  one that is absolutely vital to america's national security   i agree 100percent in addition many billions of dollars of purchases made in us big jobs  oil you just can't win with the fake news media a big story today is that because i have pushed so hard and gotten gasoline prices so low more people are driving and i have caused traffic jams throughout our great nation sorry everyone brutal and extended cold blast could shatter all records whatever happened to global warming 79percent of these decisions have been overturned in the 9th circuit   a terrible costly and dangerous disgrace it has become a dumping ground for certain lawyers looking for easy wins and delays much talk over dividing up the 9th circuit into 2 or 3 circuits too big there are a lot of criminals in the caravan we will stop them catch and detain judicial activism by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens is putting our country in great danger not good thank you to president trump on the border no american president has ever done this before hector garza national border patrol council are so many opposing view on border and safety cases filed there and why are a vast number of those cases overturned please study the numbers they are shocking we need protection and security these rulings are making our country unsafe very dangerous and unwise sorry chief justice john roberts but you do indeed have obama judges and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country it would be great if the 9th circuit was indeed an independent judiciary but if it is why great new book out mad politics keeping your sanity in a world gone crazy by  loudon go out and get your copy today  a great read ‘trump imitation syndrome' is afflicting the president's liberal enemies thank you   make america great again oil prices getting lower great like a big tax cut for america and the world enjoy $54 was just $82 thank you to saudi arabia but let's go lower america first so-called comedian michelle wolf bombed so badly last year at the white house correspondents' dinner that this year for the first time in decades they will have an author instead of a comedian good first step in comeback of a dying evening and tradition maybe i will go i hope the discovery and eventual recovery of the argentine submarine san juan brings needed closure to the wonderful families of those brave missing sailors i look forward to hearing more from my friend president  in argentina later this month the fake news is showing old footage of people climbing over our ocean area fence this is what it really looks like no climbers anymore under our administration  we no longer pay pakistan the $billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us bin laden being a prime example afghanistan being another they were just one of many countries that take from the united states without giving anything in return that's ending of course we should have captured osama bin laden long before we did i pointed him out in my book just before the attack on the world trade center president clinton famously missed his shot we paid pakistan billions of dollars  they never told us he was living there fools  loves mississippi and our great usa  from day one rick scott never wavered he was a great governor and will be even a greater senator in representing the people of florida congratulations to rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign catch and release is an obsolete term it is now catch and detain illegal immigrants trying to come into the usa often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for us asylum will be detained or turned away dems must approve border security  wall now the mayor of tijuana mexico just stated that the city is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants the backlog could last 6 months likewise the us is ill-prepared for this invasion and will not stand for it they are causing crime and big problems in mexico go home so funny to see little adam schitt d-ca talking about the fact that acting attorney general matt whitaker was not approved by the senate but not mentioning the fact that bob mueller who is highly conflicted was not approved by the senate i will be interviewed by chris wallace on  at 2:00 pm and 7:00 pm enjoy incredible to be with our great heroes today in california we will always be with you  heading to california with  kevin mccarthy  and  look forward to being with our brave firefighters first responders and  along with the many brave people of california we are with you all the way  god bless you all i can't imagine any president having a better or closer relationship with their vice president then the two of us just more fake news the enemy of the people the new york times did a phony story as usual about my relationship with  mike pence they made up sources and refused to ask me the only one that would know for a quote congratulations to andrew gillum on having run a really tough and competitive race for governor of the great state of florida he will be a strong democrat warrior long into the future a force to reckon with i can get nancy pelosi as many votes as she wants in order for her to be speaker of the house she deserves this victory she has earned it but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away she will win  thank you  look forward to joining you and  tomorrow in california we are with you  their country's flag can this be possible yes because it is all a big con and the american taxpayer is paying for it isn't it ironic that large caravans of people are marching to our border wanting usa asylum because they are fearful of being in their country yet they are proudly waving congratulations to brian kemp on becoming the new governor of georgia stacey abrams fought brilliantly and hard she will have a terrific political future brian was unrelenting and will become a great governor for the truly wonderful people of georgia congratulations to ron desantis on becoming the new governor of florida against all odds he fought  fought  fought the result being a historic victory he never gave up and never will he will be a great governor presidential medal of freedom  people are not being told that the

many others why didn't the fbi take the server from the dnc they still don't have it check out how biased facebook google and twitter are in favor of the democrats that's the real collusion universities will someday study what highly conflicted and not senate approved bob mueller and his gang of democrat thugs have done to destroy people why is he protecting crooked hillary comey mccabe lisa page  her lover peter s and all of his friends on the other side care how many lives the ruin these are angry people including the highly conflicted bob mueller who worked for obama for 8 years they won't even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side a total witch hunt like no other in american history the inner workings of the mueller investigation are a total mess they have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts they are screaming and shouting at people horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want they are a disgrace to our nation and don't the white house is running very smoothly and the results for our nation are obviously very good we are the envy of the world but anytime i even think about making changes the fake news media goes

new year   we mourn for the lives lost and we pray for the victims of the california wildfires i want to thank the firefighters and first responders for their incredible courage in the face of grave danger  the story in the new york times concerning north korea developing missile bases is inaccurate we fully know about the sites being discussed nothing new and nothing happening out of the normal just more fake news i will be the first to let you know if things go bad when will bill nelson concede in florida the characters running broward and palm beach voting will not be able to find enough votes too much spotlight on them now by the way when the helicopter couldn't fly to the first cemetery in france because of almost zero visibility i suggested driving secret service said no too far from airport  big paris shutdown speech next day at american cemetery in pouring rain little reported-fake news make france great again the problem is that emmanuel suffers from a very low approval rating in france 26percent and an unemployment rate of almost 10percent he was just trying to get onto another subject by the way there is no country more nationalist than france very proud people-and rightfully so on trade france makes excellent wine but so does the us the problem is that france makes it very hard for the us to sell its wines into france and charges big tariffs whereas the us makes it easy for french wines and charges very small tariffs not fair must change emmanuel macron suggests building its own army to protect europe against the us china and russia but it was germany in world wars one  two how did that work out for france they were starting to learn german in paris before the us came along pay for nato or not today we gathered for diwali a holiday observed by buddhists sikhs and jains throughout the united states  around the world hundreds of millions of people have gathered with family  friends to light the diya and to mark the beginning of a new year

production oil prices should be much lower based on supply american cable association has big problems with comcast they say that comcast routinely violates antitrust laws these guys are acting much worse and have much more potential for damage to consumers than anything att-time warner would do charlie gasparino the california fire fighters fema and  first responders are amazing and very brave thank you and god bless you all the prospect of presidential harassment by the dems is causing the stock market big headaches the florida election should be called in favor of rick scott and ron desantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere and many ballots are missing or forged an honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected must go with election night of money spent on protecting other countries and we get nothing but trade deficits and losses it is time that these very rich countries either pay the united states for its great military protection or protect themselvesand trade must be made free and fair hundreds of billions of dollars for the great privilege of losing hundreds of billions of dollars with these same countries on trade i told them that this situation cannot continue it is and always has been ridiculously unfair to the united states massive amounts just returned from france where much was accomplished in my meetings with world leaders never easy bringing up the fact that the us must be treated fairly which it hasn't on both military and trade we pay for large portions of other countries military protection exactly 100 years ago today on november 11th 1918 world war i came to an end we are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave americans

nation safe strong and free   with proper forest management we can stop the devastation constantly going on in california get smart these california fires are expanding very very quickly in some cases 80-100 acres a minute if people don't evacuate quickly they risk being overtaken by the fire please listen to evacuation orders from state and local officials more than 4000 are fighting the camp and woolsey fires in california that have burned over 170000 acres our hearts are with those fighting the fires the 52000 who have evacuated and the families of the 11 who have died the destruction is catastrophic god bless them all trying to steal two big elections in florida we are watching closely had very productive meetings and calls for our country today meeting tonight with world leaders happy 243rd birthday to our great us marine corps🇺🇸  i am in paris getting ready to celebrate the end of world war one is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war in particular that one which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time there is no reason for these massive deadly and costly forest fires in california except that forest management is so poor billions of dollars are given each year with so many lives lost all because of gross mismanagement of the forests remedy now or no more fed payments mr whitaker is very highly thought of by  senator  ambassador  leonard leo of federalist society and many more i feel certain he will make an outstanding acting attorney general matthew g whitaker is a highly respected former us attorney from iowa he was chosen by jeff sessions to be his chief of staff i did not know mr whitaker likewise as chief i did not know mr whitaker except primarily as he traveled with ag sessions no social contact president macron of france has just suggested that europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the us china and russia very insulting but perhaps europe should first pay its fair share of nato which the us subsidizes greatly just out  in arizona signatures don't match electoral corruption call for a new election we must protect our democracy thank you  for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to election theft in broward and palm beach counties the world is now watching closely in the 2016 election i was winning by so much in florida that broward county which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a number couldn't do it because not enough people live in broward for them to falsify a victory mayor gillum conceded on election day and now broward county has put him back into play bill nelson conceded election now he's back in play this is an embarrassment to our country and to democracy rick scott was up by 50000+ votes on election day now they found many votes and he is only up 15000 votes the broward effect how come they never find republican votes jeff flakey doesn't want to protect the non-senate confirmed special counsel he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in arizona for the crime of doing a terrible job a weak and ineffective guy as soon as democrats sent their best election stealing lawyer marc elias to broward county they miraculously started finding democrat votes don't worry florida i am sending much better lawyers to expose the fraud you mean they are just now finding votes in florida and georgia  but the election was on tuesday let's blame the russians and demand an immediate apology from president putin  ran a great race in georgia  he won it is time to move on presidential proclamation addressing mass migration through the southern border of the united states  law enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with election fraud in  and palm beach florida voted for rick scott great bravery shown by police california highway patrol was on scene within 3 minutes with first officer to enter shot numerous times that sheriff's sergeant died in the hospital god bless all of the victims and families of the victims thank you to law enforcement i have been fully briefed on the terrible shooting in california law enforcement and first responders together with the fbi are on scene 13 people at this time have been reported dead likewise the shooter is dead along with the first police officer to enter the bar we thank attorney general jeff sessions for his service and wish him well a permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date we are pleased to announce that matthew g whitaker chief of staff to attorney general jeff sessions at the department of justice will become our new acting attorney general of the united states he will serve our country well according to nbc news voters nationwide disapprove of the so-called mueller investigation 46percent more than they approve 41percent you mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting witch hunt led by 17 angry democrats is all about in all fairness nancy pelosi deserves to be chosen speaker of the house by the democrats if they give her a hard time perhaps we will add some republican votes she has earned this great honor if the democrats think they are going to waste taxpayer money investigating us at the house level then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of classified information and much else at the senate level two can play that game to any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great midterm election just remember two words fake news i will be doing a news conference at the white house 11:30 am will be discussing our success in the midterms those that worked with me in this incredible midterm election embracing certain policies and principles did very

other jurisdictions know how many people were killed fifty times last original number no way when trump visited the island territory last october officials told him in a briefing 16 people had died from maria the washington post this was long after the hurricane took place over many months it went to 64 people then like magic 3000 people killed they hired great job fema first responders and law enforcement not easy very dangerous tremendous talent america is proud of you keep it all going finish strong my thoughts and prayers are with evelyn rodriguez this evening along with her family and friends   the story of puerto rico is the rebuilding that has occurred the president has done an extraordinary job of cleanup rebuilding electrical stuff and everything else     the people of puerto rico have one of the most corrupt governments in our country  they say all these people died in the storm in puerto rico yet 70percent of the power was out before the storm so when did people start dying at what point do you recognize that what they are doing is a political agenda couched in the nice language of journalism   keep up the great work thank you  we love the  thank you   incredible job being done by fema first responders law enforcement and all thank you gina is great  john kerry had illegal meetings with the very hostile iranian regime which can only serve to undercut our great

products at home if we meet we meet this was done by the democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when i was successfully raising billions of dollars to help rebuild puerto rico if a person died for any reason like old age just add them onto the list bad politics i love puerto rico 3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit puerto rico when i left the island after the storm had hit they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths as time went by it did not go up by much then a long time later they started to report really large numbers like 3000 middle-class income hits all-time high   and will continue to rise unless the dems get in and destroy what we have built it is a cesspool of corruption and the people who did this need to be brought to justice   more text

demonstrated no wrongdoing whatsoever  that the special counsel has no evidence of any wrongdoing in other words it's time to end this witch hunt    russian collusion was just an excuse by the democrats for having lost the election crazy maxine waters after we impeach trump we'll go after mike pence we'll get him    where are the democrats coming from the best economy in the history of our country would totally collapse if they ever took control giving the information and causing the appointment of a special c without having the courage of his own convictions  alan dershowitz      in

is mostly anonymous sources in here why should anyone trust you general mattis general kelly said it's not true     bob woodward is a liar who is like a dem operative prior to the midterms he was caught cold even by nbc i'm taking this book with a grain of salt  everyone should do the same multiple sources but almost every one of them has come out and discredited the claims made by woodward you cannot take this book too seriously katelyn caralle washington examiner the white house is a smooth running machine we are making some of the biggest and most important deals in our country's history with many more to come the dems are going crazy the white house is running beautifully we are making some of the greatest and most important deals in our countries history with many more to come big progress the woodward book is a joke just another assault against me in a barrage of assaults using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources many have already come forward to say the quotes by them like the book are fiction dems can't stand losing i'll write the real book if the democrats had won the election in 2016 gdp which was about 1percent and going down would have been minus 4percent instead of up 42percent i opened up our beautiful economic engine with regulation and tax cuts our system was choking and would have been made worse still plenty to do the gdp rate 42percent is higher than the unemployment rate 39percent for the first time in over 100 years melania and i wish all jewish people shana tova and send our warmest greetings to those celebrating rosh

way down over an already really bad last year comparison viewership declined 13percent the lowest in over a decade if the players stood proudly for our flag and anthem and it is all shown on broadcast maybe ratings could come back otherwise worse trump has set economic growth on fire during his time in office the economy has achieved feats most experts thought impossible gdp is growing at a 3 percent-plus rate the unemployment rate is near a 50 year low cnbcalso the stock market is up almost 50percent since election if the us sells a car into china there is a tax of 25percent if china sells a car into the us there is a tax of 2percent does anybody think that is fair the days of the us being ripped-off by other nations is over ford has abruptly killed a plan to sell a chinese-made

nothing would get done also i question everybody  everything-which is why i got elected isn't it a shame that someone can write an article or book totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact and get away with it without retribution or cost don't know why washington politicians don't change libel laws secretary mattis nukes woodward allegations  jim mattis calls woodward book 'fiction' 'product of someone's rich imagination'  via  the already discredited woodward book so many lies and phony sources has me calling jeff sessions mentally retarded and a dumb southerner i said neither never used those terms on anyone including jeff and being a southerner is a great thing he made this up to divide sleepy eyes chuck todd of fake nbc news said it's time for the press to stop complaining and to start fighting back actually chuck they've been doing that from the day i announced for president they've gone all out and i won and now they're going crazy the woodward book has already been refuted and discredited by general secretary of defense james mattis and general chief of staff john kelly their quotes were made up frauds a con on the public likewise other stories and quotes woodward is a dem operative notice timing statement from white house  sarah sanders  statement from white house chief of staff general john kelly

news which is under intense scrutiny over their killing the harvey weinstein story is now fumbling around making excuses for their probably highly unethical conduct i have long criticized nbc and their journalistic standards-worse than even cnn look at their license president bashar al-assad of syria must not recklessly attack idlib province the russians and iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy hundreds of thousands of people could be killed don't let that happen according to the failing new york times the fbi started a major effort to flip putin loyalists in 2014-2016 it wasn't about trump he wasn't even close to a candidate yet  rigged witch hunt i see that john kerry the father of the now terminated iran deal is thinking of running for president i should only be so lucky although the field that is currently assembling looks really good for me the democrats none of whom voted for jeff sessions must love him now same thing with lyin' james comey the dems all hated him wanted him out thought he was disgusting until i fired him immediately he became a wonderful man a saint like figure in fact really sick two long running obama era investigations of  two very popular republican congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge just ahead of the mid-terms by the jeff sessions justice department two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time good job jeff the us is respected again  richard trumka the head of the afl-cio represented his union poorly on television this weekend some of the things he said were so against the working men and women of our country and the success of the us itself that it is easy to see why unions are doing so poorly a dem the worker in america is doing better than ever before celebrate labor day happy labor day our country is doing better than ever before with unemployment setting record lows the us has tremendous upside potential as we go about fixing some of the worst trade deals ever made by any country in the world big progress being made richard trumka the head of the afl-cio represented his union poorly on television this weekend some of the things he said were so againt the working men and women of our country and the success of the us itself that it is easy to see why unions are doing so poorly a dem the fact is that african/american unemployment is now the lowest in the history of our country same with asian hispanic and almost every other group the democrats have been all talk and no action my administration has already produced like no other and everyone sees it tiger woods showed great class in the way he answered the question about the office of the presidency and me now they say the so-called left is angry at him so sad but the center  right loves tiger kanye george foreman jim brown  so many other greats even more there is no possible way the trump tower meeting between don trump jr and a couple of russians who have very deep connections to both the clintons  fusion gps  where no information on the clintons was exchanged is a crime dems are blinded by their hatred of trump bongino no information was ever given by the trump team to russia yet the hillary clinton campaign paid for information from kremlin sources and just washed it through an intermediary christopher steele  jesse waters positions of power that's part of the story of the russia hoax christopher steele is on the payroll of hillary clinton  the fbi  when they fired him for lying they continued to use him violation of fbi regulations kept trying to verify the unverifiable  there's no fairness here if you're a democrat or a friend of hillary you get immunity or off scott free if you're connected to donald trump you get people like robert mueller  andrew weissman and his team of partisans coming after you with a vengeance and abusing their we shouldn't have to buy our friends with bad trade deals and free military protection make america great again no deal trade talks with canada conclude for the week with no agreement | breitbart  via  remember nafta was one of the worst trade deals ever made the us lost thousands of businesses and millions of jobs we were far better off before nafta should never have been signed even the vat tax was not accounted for we make new deal or go back to pre-nafta there is no political necessity to keep canada in the new nafta deal if we don't make a fair deal for the us after decades of abuse canada will be out congress should not interfere w/ these negotiations or i will simply terminate nafta entirely  we will be far better off donald trump and now we find out that there wasn't even a hearing that donald trump's 4th amendment right to privacy was signed awayand someone in there is swearing that this stuff is true when it wasn't this is the scandal here a police state  dan bongino you have a fake dossier gathered by steele paid by the clinton team to get information on trump the dossier is fake nothing in it has been verified it then filters into our american court system in order to spy on barrack obama and hillary clinton's political opponent of the doj  fbi are completely out to lunch in terms of exposing and holding those accountable who are responsible for that corruption   report there were no fisa hearings held over spy documentsit is astonishing that the fisa courts couldn't hold hearings on spy warrants targeting donald trump it isn't about carter page it's about the trump campaign you've got corruption at the doj  fbi the leadership i love canada but they've taken advantage of our country for many years i think today what has happened is that news reporting has become part of the adversary system alan dershowitz  it has become tainted and corrupt djt there is no political necessity to keep canada in the new nafta deal if we don't make a fair deal for the us after decade of abuse canada will be out congress should not interfere with these negotiations or i will simply terminate nafta entirely  we will be far better off still can't believe that bloomberg violated a firm off the record statement will they put out an apology great day in north carolina where republicans will do very well the abc/washington post poll was by far the least accurate one 2 weeks out from the 2016 election i call it a suppression poll but by election day they brought us out of shame to about even they will never learn  just came out at 48percent approval rate despite the constant and intense fake news higher than election day and higher than president obama rasmussen was one of the most accurate election day polls
