they be not come into the usa we will close the border permanently if need be congress fund the wall child from parent as do bush etc because that be the policy and law I try to keep they together but the problem be when you do that vast number of additional people storm the border so with obama seperation be fine but with trump it be not fake 60 minute   do a phony story about child separation when they know we have the exact same policy as the obama administration in fact a picture of child in jail be use by other fake medium to show how bad cruel we be but it be in 2014 during o year
