another president lawyer has already stated that i did nothing wrong john bolton is a patriot and may know that i held back the money from ukraine because it is considered a corrupt country  i wanted to know why nearby european countries weren't putting up money also likewise i would the dc wolves and fake news media are reading far too much into people being forced by courts to testify before congress i am fighting for future presidents and the office of the president other than that i would actually like people to testify don mcgahn's respected when the military rips down an old  badly broken border wall in an important location  replaces it with a brand new 30 ft high steel  concrete wall nancy pelosi says we are not building a wall wrong and it is going up fast brandon judd just gave us great marks  i will always protect our great warfighters i've got your backs great job heather  poll shows dems losing interest in impeachment inquiry all across the board these polls are

impeaching trump for no reason will backfire into big 2020 victory for republicans  dow nasdaq sp 500 close at record highs  another new stock market record enjoy the democrats are getting hit and slammed on impeachment it is getting less and less popular by the day   support for impeachment is dropping like a rock down into the 20's in some polls dems should now get down to work and finally approve usmca and much more president trump is facing a process which is unprecedented for its unfairness sam dewey honors that he has earned including his trident pin admiral and now ambassador to norway ken braithwaite will be nominated by me to be the new secretary of the navy a man of great achievement and success i know ken will do an outstanding job contracting procedures were not addressed to my satisfaction therefore secretary of the navy richard spencer's services have been terminated by secretary of defense mark esper i thank richard for his service  commitment eddie will retire peacefully with all of the i was not pleased with the way that navy seal eddie gallagher's trial was handled by the navy he was treated very badly but despite this was completely exonerated on all major charges i then restored eddie's rank likewise large cost overruns from past administration's democrats going back to their districts for thanksgiving are getting absolutely hammered by their constituents over the phony impeachment scam republicans will have a great  election the whole russia thing was a hoax and the ukraine thing is a hoax and the democrats are a joke this is a disaster for them   the do nothing democrats are hurting our country and they don't care the impeachment scam is driving republican poll numbers up up up thank you shifty this is a great and well reseached book on justice k the ruth marcus book is a badly written  reseached disaster so many incorrect facts fake news just like the   witch hunt  but i did nothing wrong read the transcripts 2  100percent correct  agnes your great boy ronald is looking down very proud of you  exclusive elise stefanik reflects on her two-week whirlwind  the unspoken truth what impeachment exposed about trump and 2020  this is the real story behind the do nothing democrats  too bad we didn't have the g-7 here i offered to pick up the entire cost would have saved at least $35000000 for the usa best location very stupid people thought i would gain wrong looking at camp david will announce soon  polls have now turned very strongly against impeachment especially in swing states 75percent to 25percent thank you nancy pelosi adam schiff aoc and the rest of the democrats are not getting important legislation done hence the do nothing democrats usmca national defense authorization act gun safety prescription drug prices  infrastructure are dead in the water because of the dems navy seal eddie gallagher will be on  this morning at 7:30 am have no fear all will end well for everyone pushed hard to have apple build in usa  95percent approval rate in the republican party a record thank you thank you kevin for the nice words  sondland said trump told him none of this will move the needle for anyone and now dems in swing districts head home for thanksgiving to hear from voters pelosi  co are putting on a show to appease the democratic base instead of doing the work all americans need done any direct evidence that president trump did anything impeachable no one heard him order a quid pro quo no one offered a convincing reason why trump's interest in having ukraine probe potential cortuption warrants impeachment i want no quid pro quo ambassador new york post editorial worse than pointless all those hours of televised testimony plainly failed on their announced goal to change american's minds part of the problem is that democrats already leaked the best evidence they had more important not one witness offered daniel cameron who just won the ag race in the great commonwealth of kentucky is a young and very talented political star you will be hearing much from cameron in the years to come brennan too and the whistleblower also worked for susan rice it's an understatement to say that this is a witch hunt   they spied on my campaign the democrats dirty tricks have started this whole thing the whistleblower the guy who took his case to schiff's staff first is what really blows the lid off this entire saga he worked for biden on ukraine policy when biden was vp he worked for deep state henchman john joe concha the hill in emerson college poll impeachment among independents 49percent oppose 34percent support you see why pelosi is reluctant to go in with this dems have to go home and explain why they haven't done something on opioid crisis drug prices usmca the border etc adam schiff will be compelled to testify should the democrats decide despite the fact that my presidential conversations were totally appropriate perfect to go forward with the impeachment hoax polls have now turned very strongly against impeachment sondland said trump told him none of this will move the needle for anyone and now dems in swing districts head home for thanksgiving to hear from voters pelosi  co are putting on a show to appease the democratic base instead if doing the work all americans need done daniel cameron who just won the ag race in the great commonwealth of kentucky is a young and very talented political star you will be hearing much from cameron in the yesrs to come the support for impeachment is not there i think the democrats will have to come up with a new game plan   house republicans are showing real leadership and prepared to enact bipartisan solutions for drug prices do nothing democrats are playing partisan politics with your drug prices we are ready to work together if they actually want to get something done pelosi and her do nothing democrats drug pricing bill doesn't do the trick fewer cures fewer treatments time for the democrats to get serious about bipartisan solutions to lowering prescription drug prices for families while we had the first prescription drug price decrease in 50 years americans still pay far too much for drugs  other countries pay far less  that is wrong we will soon be putting more options on the table  and i will soon release a plan to let florida and other states import prescription drugs that are much cheaper than what we have now hard-working americans don't deserve to pay such high prices for the drugs they need we are fighting daily to make sure this happens thank you to  mitch mcconnell and  kevin mccarthy for their great leadership there has never been so much unity and spirit in the republican party as there is right now i will be interviewed on  this morning at 8:00 am i know that there's not much to talk about but we will try to keep the conversation going enjoy    former fbi employee accused of altering fisa documents hello here we go  rt  schiff's fact witnesses  thank you  and  great job  mark levin on impeachment hysteria  schiff's charade   schiff's fact witnesses  they want zero transparency thinking the world will not find out the death and tragedy that the iranian regime is causing iran has become so unstable that the regime has shut down their entire internet system so that the great iranian people cannot talk about the tremendous violence taking place within the country president trump said the ukraine president should just do the right thing no quid pro quo you shouldn't charge but you cannot convict a sitting president on the basis of conflicting and ambiguous evidence and destabilize the american government thank you ken ken starr former independent counsel does this reach the level of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors my assessment of the evidence so far no where close the evidence is conflicting  ambiguous ambassador sondland's testimony stated that i have been watching people making phone calls my entire life my hearing is and has been great never have i been watching a person making a call which was not on speakerphone and been able to hear or understand a conversation i've even tried but to no avail try it live read the two transcripts of ukrainian calls the navy will not be taking away warfighter and navy seal eddie gallagher's trident pin this case was handled very badly from the beginning get back to business nothing gives schiff jurisdiction over impeachment the new house resolution gives adam schiff the most dishonest man in politics the power unilaterally to release edited transcripts rule 10 gives chairman schiff absolutely no jurisdiction subpoenas issued as part of dems' impeachment inquiry are illegal sam dewey  but we are winning big and they will soon be on our turf corrupt politician adam schiff's lies are growing by the day keep fighting tough republicans you are dealing with human scum who have taken due process and all of the republican party's rights away from us during the most unfair hearings in american history i never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word impeachment the calls transcripts were perfect there was nothing said that was wrong no pressure on ukraine great corruption  dishonesty by schiff on the other side freed taliban hostages arrive in germany      we got them back president before what they are doing is not legal but i'm clean and when i release my financial statement my decision sometime prior to election it will only show one thing that i am much richer than people even thought and that is a good thing jobs jobs jobs bob mueller after spending two years and 45 million dollars went over all of my financials  my taxes and found nothing now the witch hunt continues with local new york democrat prosecutors going over every financial deal i have ever done this has never happened to a the republican party and me had a great day yesterday with respect to the phony impeachment hoax  yet when i got home to the white house  checked out the news coverage on much of television you would have no idea they were reporting on the same event fake  corrupt news during my visit yesterday to austin texas for the startup of the new mac pro  the discussion of a new one $billion campus also in texas i asked tim cook to see if he could get apple involved in building 5g in the us they have it all money technology vision  cookl why do    waste airtime on democrat rep eric swalwell who recently left the presidential primaries having attained a grand number of zero in the polls i don't even know how that is possible fox should stay with the people that got them there not losers poll trump leads top 2020 democrats in wisconsin  all four of gordon sondland's lawyers are democrat donors   despite this big win today for republicans watch    big news  if this were a prizefight they'd stop it today i opened a major apple manufacturing plant in texas that will bring high paying jobs back to america today nancy pelosi closed congress because she doesn't care about american workers i want nothing  i want nothing i want nothing i want no quid pro quo tell president zelensky to do the right thing later ambassador sondland said that i told him good go tell the truth this witch hunt must end now so bad for our country impeachment witch hunt is now over ambassador sondland asks us president me what do you want from ukraine i keep hearing all these different ideas  theories what do you want it was a very abrupt conversation he was not in a good mood he the president just said we join families of kevin king  tim weeks in celebrating their release from taliban captivity thanks to president ghani for his courageous support let's hope this leads to more good things on the peace front like a ceasefire that will help end this long war proud of my team nancy pelosi will go down as the least productive speaker of the house in history she is dominated by aoc plus 3 and the radical left mexico and canada after waiting for 6 months to be approved are ready to flee and who can blame them too bad white house confidence grows as hearings wear on   this is just an attempted takedown of the republican party by the do nothing democrats it will never work  the three year hoax continues  true great job   read the transcripts  thank you tennessee  congressman van drew d-nj we've spent millions of dollars in my opinion tons of money tons of time tons of hurt fracturing the nation apart i haven't seen this to be a good thing rt  a new poll has independents opposing the impeachment of president  10percent more this is not working with th a great day for republicans a great day for our country i agree but in the end we will win and save our country from certain destruction  nasdaq up 27percent this year alone rt  this is what was asked today was there a bribe no did anybody ask you to bribe anyone no was there extortion no t nancy pelosi just stated that it is dangerous to let the voters decide trump's fate   in other words she thinks i'm going to win and doesn't want to take a chance on letting the voters decide like al green she wants to change our voting system wow she's crazy the do nothing democrats have disgraced our great country  at my meeting with jay powell this morning i protested fact that our fed rate is

finished a very good  cordial meeting at the white house with jay powell of the federal reserve everything was discused including interest rates negative interest low inflation easing dollar strength  its effect on manufacturing trade with china eu  others etc all they do is bring up witnesses who didn't witness anything    nothing matters except the two transcripts of the presidential calls and the statement of no pressure put out by ukraine the impeachment started before he even became president    where is the fake whistleblower republicans  others must remember the ukrainian president and foreign minister both said that there was no pressure placed on them whatsoever also they didn't even know the money wasn't paid and got the money with no conditions but why isn't germany france

and foreign minister of ukraine nervous nancy pelosi who should be home cleaning up the dangerous  disgusting slum she is making of her district in san francisco where even the ambassador sondland did not tell us and certainly did not tell me about a connection between the assistance and the investigation the fake impeachment inquiry is now dead democrats must apologize to usa ukrainian foreign

clarita california through our ongoing communications with local state and federal authorities where's the fake whistleblower that the house democrats have done since she's become speaker other than chase donald trump this impeachment hoax is such a bad precedent and sooo bad for our country anywhere so we've now had 3 years of the democrats chasing donald trump nancy pelosi's worried about the american voter looking for someone to blame for that eventually look at her own story in the house what have they done the average american can't identify anything   wsj nancy pelosi had it right the first time when she did not want to go down the impeachment path make it a voting issue but no the left insisted on raising this to the gravity of a constitutional crisis  impeachment the hearings suggested it's not going that hearing was about a policy dispute robert ray regular people watching this cannot conclude that the president of the united states can be impeached  neither one of the democrat star witnesses at the impeachment hearings could point out an impeachable offense that's the result    walmart announces great numbers no impact from tariffs which are contributing $billions to our treasury inflation low do you hear that powell hit new stock market record again yesterday the 20th time this year with great potential for the future usa is where the action is companies and jobs are coming back like never before  asked the two star witnesses where is the impeachable event in that call both stared straight ahead with a blank look on their face remained silent  were unable to answer the question that would be the end of a case run by normal people but not shifty wow was just told that my son's book triggered is number one on the new york times bestseller list congratulations don thank you  it is a time of shame for our country the democrats know what they are doing is wrong  read the transcript never trumpers any laws or did anything wrong and they have to move away from quid pro quo because there was no quid and there was no quo ukraine got it's money 3 weeks early and there was no investigation   the most powerful tool the legislative branch has impeachment  they've turned it into a political cudgel which is not at all what the founders intended when you hear schiff use all these words like quid pro quo it is because they can't specify that donald trump broke nancy pelosi cares more about power than she does about principle she did not want to go down this road she realizes this is a huge loser for democrats the founders envisioned the worst people being in politics yet they couldn't envision this you have these people taking the democrats have stacked the deck against president trump and the republicans they have leaked out everything   millions of americans will see what a partisan sham this whole thing is rush limbaugh   also why is corrupt politician schiff allowed to hand over cross examination to a high priced outside lawyer did that lawyer ever work for me which would be a conflict to hurt donald trump and we the people that support him the left has never accepted the results of the 2016 election they never saw this coming this is not just about president trump they hate everyone he is representing    sean the amazing warrior this is a phony showtrial there is zero due process none it is yet another fraudulent hoax conspiracy theory it is another witch hunt this is what the socialist doemocrat party has become there's not one thing the democrats have done in the past 3 years except try the circus is coming to town the corrupt compromised coward  congenital liar adam schiff show on capital hill brought to you by his raging psychotic democrats  the top allies in the media mob everything you're going to see in the next two weeks is rigged this ridiculous impeachment is a travesty it's not an inquiry just read the transcript  daca recipients with arrest records 53792 that is a very large proportion of the total   not good but we will be able to make a deal with the dems a total impeachment scam by the do nothing democrats  many of the people in daca no longer very young are far from angels some are very tough hardened criminals president obama said he had no legal right to sign order but would anyway if supreme court remedies with overturn a deal will be made with dems for them to stay economy is booming seems set to have yet another record day i will be releasing the transcript of the first and therefore more important phone call with the ukrainian president before week's end ukrainian energy company and more millions taken from china and now reports of other companies and countries also giving him big money are certainly looking very corrupt to put it mildly to me both bidens should be forced to testify in this no due process scam no pressure put on him to investigate sleepy joe biden even though as president i have an obligation to look into corruption and biden's actions on tape about firing the prosecutor and his son's taking millions of dollars with no knowledge or talent from a why is such a focus put on 2nd and 3rd hand witnesses many of whom are never trumpers or whose lawyers are never trumpers when all you have to do is read the phone call transcript with the ukrainian president and see first hand he and others also stated that there was a great try by  we are all proud of you vote for sean spicer on dancing with the stars he is a great and very loyal guy who is working very hard he is in the quarterfinals all the way with sean    this isn't about ukraine this isn't about impeachment this is about subverting democracy  so true and led by angry and dishonest people who hate themselves and must hate our country want that to be an impeachable offense good luck with that   the president has until september 30th to give this aid to ukraine he gets it out on september 11th 3 weeks before the deadline so we give our ally aid and joe biden is not investigated remember that they get the aid and we get nothing in return the democrats schiff and the dems have created this whole thing they reverse engineer it they've been vowing to impeach for three years why should we listen to them why should we want to    in order to continue being the most transparent president in history i will be releasing sometime this week the transcript of the first and therefore most important phone call i had with the president of ukraine i am sure you will find it tantalizing just like schiff fabricated my phone call he will fabricate the transcripts that he is making and releasing schiff is giving republicans no witnesses no lawyer  no due process it is a totally one sided witch hunt this can't be making the democrats look good such a farce read the transcript it is perfect to think i signed the whistleblower protection act  where is the whistleblower who gave so much false information must testify along with schiff and others today we come together as one nation to salute the veterans of the united states armed forces  the greatest warriors ever to walk on the face of the earth our veterans risked everything for us now it is our duty to serve and protect them every day of our lives  the chinese say about trump's trade war  tariffs ‘he brought us to the table' this is the most prosperous economy the world has ever seen and it's going to be a very prosperous economy jamie dimon on   thank you president trump  the republican party shifty adam schiff will only release doctored transcripts we haven't even seen the documents and are restricted from get this having a lawyer republicans should put out their own transcripts schiff must testify as to why he made up a statement from me and read it to all the lawyer for the whistleblower takes away all credibility from this big impeachment scam it should be ended and the whistleblower his lawyer and corrupt politician schiff should be investigared for fraud so with one rally by me at the end of the campaign i lift the poll numbers of kentucky governor matt bevin by 19 points he just misses every other republican in the commonwealth wins big and the fake news blames me for a bad night ok by the way mississippi won everything will be meeting with representatives of the vaping industry together with medical professionals and

showtrial indeed allowing a long drawn out trial in the senate would merely validate and perpetuate the fraud begun in the house the crisis is of the democrats own making and it's up to republicans to make sure this never happens the dems have selectively leaked nor was there any corrupt intent on the part of the president remember the president knew that that call was being heard and documented by many people anyone with intent would be a tad more discreet don't you think this farce should now is the time for republicans to stand together and defend the leader of their party against these smears it would be one thing if there were any indication of an underlying crime but there is not-not in the transcripts and not in the secret witness testimony that congratulations to the washington nationals on a great season and an incredible world series game 7 was amazing  thank you daily wire very cute recreation but the live version of conan will be leaving the middle east for the white house sometime next week  the do nothing democrats have gone crazy very bad for usa  the democrats have been on this path for 3 years the first headline i sawbefore the president was sworn in was that

unfairly by the democrats because he is doing an unbelievable job and fulfilling every one of his promises now they are trying to recall him because his agenda is the economy jobs and protecting the united states military congress needs to do its work we need to fund our armed forces   mitch mcconnell  the dems are a lost cause in 2020 we need a big beautiful win all three  our country cannot afford for the democrats in congress to take a one year vacation from any productive legislation just because they would rather obsess over impeachment isis  other radical terrorists are not going to hit the pause button because democrats won't fund precisely the same program that the democrats are trying to  impeach president trump for supposedly slow walking tomorrow right here in the senate they the dems say they're going to filibuster for the exact same program  mitch mcconnell do nothing democrats yesterday's never trumper witness could find no quid pro quo in the transcript of the phone call there were many people listening to the call how come they including the president of ukraine found nothing wrong with it witch hunt a federal judge is allowing the nick sandman libel suit to move forward against the thoroughly disgusting washington post which is no longer available at the white house he could now have a good chance of winning go nick it does appear it has to do with nancy pelosi retaining her speakership in the next congress she would like that so she's going to put it to a vote because that's what her political left really wants    a disgraceful use of impeachment will backfire the greatest economy in american history the call with the ukrainian president was a totally appropriate one as he said no pressure this impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the witch hunt hoax which has been going on since before i even got elected rupublicans go with substance and close it out republicans are very unified and energized in our fight on the impeachment hoax with the do nothing democrats and now  are starting to go after the substance even more than the very infair process because just a casual reading of the transcript leads everybody to see that nervous nancy pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the republican party our polls show that it is going to be just the opposite the do nothing dems will lose many seats in 2020 they have a death wish led by a corrupt politician adam schiff over in europe and japan they have negative rates they get paid to borrow money don't we have to follow our competitors   yes we do the fed doesn't have a clue we have unlimited potential only held back by the federal reserve but we are winning anyway consumer confidence number very good housing sales in september up nicely economy rocks a great new book just out the plot against the president the true story of how congressman devin nunez uncovered the biggest political scandal in us history shows very bad and corrupt people on the other side check it out just confirmed that abu bakr al-baghdadi's number one replacement has been terminated by american troops most likely would have taken the top spot now he is also dead 95percent approval rating in the republican party a record thank you supposedly according to the corrupt media the ukraine call concerned today's never trumper witness was he on the same call that i was can't be possible please ask him to read the transcript of the call witch hunt how many more never trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is read the transcript i knew people were listening in on the call why would i say something inappropriate which was fine with me but why so many the do nothing democrats are working hard to make everyone forget the best economy ever the monumental weekend raid tax cuts the rebuilding of our military etc the impeachment hoax is a disgrace read the transcript where's the whistleblower just read the transcript everything else is made up garbage by shifty schiff and the never trumpers a great book by a great guy get it now  correct a total scam  why are people that i never even heard of testifying about the call just read the call transcript and the impeachment hoax is over ukrain said no pressure  this is a big win for america and also for president trump  the only crimes in the impeachment hoax were committed by shifty adam schiff when he totally made up my phone conversation with the ukrainian president and read it to congress together with numerous others on shifty's side schiff should be impeached and worse there is no underlying crime in that transcript   100percent correct and the whistleblower disappeared after i released the transcript of the call where is the whistleblower that is why this is now called the impeachment hoax the do nothing dems are doing nothing americans know by now that the impeachment inquiry is just another hoax and silent coup to remove the president from office jj crovatto  don't worry jj schiff is a leaker  corrupt politician who made up what i said on the call in order to hurt the republican party  me nervous nancy pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the republican party our polls show that it is going to be just the oppidite the do nothing dems will lose many seats in 2020 they have a death wish led by a corrupt politician adam schiff can you believe that shifty adam schiff the biggest leaker in dc and a corrupt politician is upset that we didn't inform him before we raided and killed the  terrorist in the world wouldn't be surprised if the do nothing democrats impeach me over that drain the swamp so nice thank you  we have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog name

made up what i said on the call we should all work together to clean up these hazardous waste and homeless sites before the whole city rots away very bad and dangerous conditions also severely impacting the pacific ocean and water supply pelosi must work on this mess and turn her district around i can't believe that nancy pelosi's district in san francisco is in such horrible shape that the city itself is in violation of many sanitary  environmental orders causing it to owe the federal government billions of dollars and all she works on is impeachment not a single american citizen has been charged with anything related to russian collusion not one person   it was all an illegal witch hunt had a beautiful dinner last night at camp david in celebration of the 10th wedding anniversary

thank you   great book  wow  my lawyers should sue the democrats and shifty adam schiff for fraud the entire impeachment scam was based on my perfect ukrainian call and the whistleblowers account of that call which turned out to be false a fraud once i released the actual call their entire case fell apart the democrats must end this scam now witch hunt democrats just announced that they no longer want the whistleblower to testify but everything was about the whistleblower they no longer want the second whistleblower either which they don't want because the account of my call bore no relationship to the call itself to tim the button on the iphone was far better than the swipe in the basement of the united states capitol they cannot win at the ballot box their sham for the past 3 years continues the good news is that the american people get it which will be proven once again on november 3 2020 i appreciate the support of senator   mitch mcconnell and their great senate

middle east wrong for 20 years ask what we are getting out of the deal i simply say the oil and we are bringing our soldiers back home isis secured usa has gained trillions of dollars in wealth since november 2016 all others way down our power is economic before having to use our newly rebuilt military a much better alternative oil is secured our soldiers have left and are leaving syria for other places then turkey fully understands not to fire on the kurds as they leave what will be known as the safe zone for other fairly nearby areas i don't have to repeat that large scale sanctions will be imposed for violations going well isis secured by kurds with turkey ready as backup so congressman tim ryan of ohio has finally dropped out of the race for president registering zero in the polls  unable to even qualify for the debate stage see tim it's not so easy out there if you don't know what you're doing he wasn't effective for usa workers just talk another big dropout of the presidential race was along with 0percent tim ryan 0percent  such talk and bravado from both and nothing to show they stood for nothing and the voters couldn't stand by them obnoxious and greedy politicians never make it in the end rt  today  is receiving the bipartisan justice award for his historic work on criminal justice reformat the sa rt  let's call this sham what it really is an  against  purely political proce where is the whistleblower and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the ukrainian president why did the ig allow this to happen who is the so-called informant schiff who was so inaccurate a giant scam i really enjoyed my conversation with general  he appreciates what we have done and i appreciate what the kurds have done perhaps it is time for the kurds to start heading to the oil region the oil fields discussed in my speech on turkey/kurds yesterday were held by isis until the united states took them over with the help of the kurds we will never let a reconstituted isis have those fields thank you to house republicans for being tough smart and understanding in detail the greatest witch hunt in american history it has been going on since long before i even got elected the insurance policy a total scam the federal reserve is derelict in its duties if it doesn't lower the rate and even ideally stimulate take a look around the world at our competitors germany and others are  actually getting paid to borrow money fed was way too fast to raise and way too slow to cut don't hurt them please  it is the only thing the do nothing dems are doing  just a continuation of the witch hunt  kiddingly we're building a wall in coloradothen stated we're not building a wall in kansas but they get the benefit of the wall we're building on the border refered to people in the very packed auditorium from colorado  kansas getting the benefit of the border wall rt    promises made promises kept   it was wonderful to be back in pittsburgh pennsylvania with the incredible patriots who fuel our factories light up our homes power our industries and fill our hearts with true american pride   it would be really great if the people within the trump administration all well-meaning and good i hope could stop hiring never trumpers who are worse than the do nothing democrats nothing good will ever come from them does anybody think this is fair even though there was no quid pro quo i'm sure they would like to try worse than the dems never trumper republican john bellinger represents never trumper diplomat bill taylor who i don't know in testimony before congress do nothing democrats allow republicans zero representation zero due process and zero transparency the never trumper republicans though on respirators with not many left are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our country than the do nothing democrats watch out for them they are human scum thank you general mazloum for your kind words and courage please extend my warmest regards to the kurdish people i look forward to seeing you soon  where's the whistleblower big success on the turkey/syria border safe zone created ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us captured isis prisoners secured i will be making a statement at 11:00 am from the white house thank you feel empowered there's a movement happening on these campuses like i've never seen before when you have 3000 students wanting to get into an event that couldn't get in that's pretty remarkable   turning point usa   keep america great order a couple of months ago saying that any school that does not uphold the first amendment rights of its students will lose federal funding we have seen a huge change in how the universities interact with us as a national  local student organization our studends young campus conservatives are flocking to turning point usa  other conservative speaker events all over the country and in record numbers thousands of students are turning out i just want to compliment the president of the united states for signing that historic executive republicans are going to fight harder than ever to win back the house because of what the do nothing democrats have done to our country neither he taylor or any other witness has provided testimony that the ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld you can't have a quid pro quo with no quo congressman john ratcliffe  where is the whistleblower the do nothing dems case is dead it never ends the do nothing dems are terrible  thank you steve  the democrats scam goes on and on they do nothing  the witch hunt continues  the do nothing dems have nothing but time  wrong never even discussed this with kellyanne conway or steve mnuchin just more fake news  wrong never even discussed this with kellyanne conway ot steve mnuchin just more fake news  good news seems to be happening with respect to turkey syria and the middle east further reports to come later great job tim  the democrats are trying to draw out this inquiry because they don't have the support donald trump is guilty only of winning the 2016 election   can't believe that nervous nancy pelosi isn't moving faster on usmca her people want it they don't know why she isn't putting it up for a bipartisan vote taking too long 95percent approval rating in the republican party thank you thank you republicans 185 out of 185 present voted for us last night really good so some day if a democrat becomes president and the republicans win the house even by a tiny margin they can impeach the president without due process or fairness or any legal rights all republicans must remember what they are witnessing here a lynching but we will win    i want to know about hillary clinton with the dossier i want to know if there was fisa abuse we're still waiting for that report    a majority do not want him impeached and removed from office 94percent of the people in these battleground states who voted for president trump want him to continue as president that's squarely in his corner  that's a revealing poll don't you think that matters i thought a very revealing poll was done by the new york times by about a 10 point margin those in battleground states polled are against impeaching the president and if nancy pelosi doesn't take note of that maybe she is the third rate politician   the ambassador to the european union has already testified he said there was no quid pro quo he said the president had told him that    congratulations to  on a wonderful and hard fought victory canada is well served i look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries thank you liz shows great republican support  thank you dan and kevin great vote  will be interviewed by  tonight at 9:00 pm on  enjoy doral in miami would have been the best place to hold the g-7 and free but too much heat from the do nothing radical left democrats  their partner the fake news media i'm surprised that they allow me to give up my $400000 plus presidential salary we'll find someplace else censure at least corrupt adam schiff after what he got caught doing any pol who does not so vote cannot be honestare you listening dems great new book by wonderful and very street smart author dan bongino exonerated the failed takedown of president donald trump by the swamp dan hits all of the crooked points of the greatest witch hunt in political history nevertheless the scam continues thank you john so nice  rt  they still pretend they cannot see all of this  the are hypocrites we know keep up with the good work you have my a great democrat scam  adam schiff is a corrupt politician  congratulations barbara  to the democrats impeachment is partisan politics dressed up as principle   so interesting that when i announced trump national doral in miami would be used for the hosting of the g-7 and then rescinded due to do nothing democrat/fake news anger very few in media mentioned that no profits would be taken or would be given free if legally permissible fiction to congress and the american people  i demand his deposition he is a fraud just like the russia hoax was and the ukraine hoax is now when do the do nothing democrats pay a price for what they are doing to our country  when do the republicans finally fight back because their so-called story didn't come even close to matching up with the exact transcript of the phone call was it a corrupt adam schiff con why didn't the ig see this when do we depose shifty schiff to find out why he fraudulently made up my phone call and read this this scam going on right now by the democrats against the republican party and me was all about a perfect phone call i had with the ukrainian president he's already stated no pressure where is the whistleblower or the 2nd whistleblower or the informant all gone pelosi is now leading a delegation of 9 including corrupt adam schiff to jordan to check out syria she should find out why obama drew the red line in the sand  then did nothing losing syria  all respect i did something 58 missiles one million died under obama's mistake the ceasefire is holding up very nicely there are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly new areas being resettled with kurds us soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zone we have secured the oil mark esper secretary of defense ending endless wars the wall is making a very big difference even dems in area are happy  so now crooked hillary is at it again she is calling congresswoman tulsi gabbard a russian favorite and jill stein a russian asset as you may have heard i was called a big russia lover also actually i do like russian people i like all people hillary's gone crazy never give up we are doing great we are winning  therefore based on both media  democrat crazed and irrational hostility we will no longer consider trump national doral miami as the host site for the g-7 in 2020 we will begin the search for another site including the possibility of camp david immediately thank you its own 50 to 70 unit building would set up better than other alternatives i announced that i would be willing to do it at no profit or if legally permissible at zero cost to the usa but as usual the hostile media  their democrat partners went crazy i thought i was doing something very good for our country by using trump national doral in miami for hosting the g-7 leaders it is big grand on hundreds of acres next to miami international airport has tremendous ballrooms  meeting rooms and each delegation would have mark esperanto secretary of defense the ceasefire is holding up very nicely there are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly new areas being resettled with the kurds usa soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zones we have secured the oil bringing soldiers home the president never told me to withhold any money until the ukrainians did anything related to the server the only reason we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption yesterday's mick mulvaney statement see you there  crooked hillary clinton just called the respected environmentalist and green party candidate jill stein a russian asset they need a green party more than ever after looking at the democrats disastrous environmental program it is only about this  just another fake suppression poll this time from  of course    thank you tom great interview on   a great book by kimberley strassel  i don't see anything that constitutes an impeachable offense nothing here rises to the level of impeachment the democrats are making a mistake with this secrecy kenn starr former special prosecutor thank you very much working hard  i agree  texas is great  there has never been a greater fraud on congress shifty schiff is corrupt go andy  such a disgrace that the do nothing democrats are doing just as their name suggests doing nothing usmca anyone  rt  free beacon reminds us of lefty double standard between brewer pelosi finger wags  susan rice who was a disaster to president obama as national security advisor is now telling us her opinion on what to do in syria remember red line in the sand that was obama millions killed no thanks susan you were a disaster pelosi and impeachment there have already been 3 votes and they've all failed miserably here's why there may not be a fourth 137 democrats voted against on the last vote     many of those voting in favor will be beaten in 2020 congressman michael mccaul schiff's inquiry defies democracy   because the house has already voted against the impeachment proceeding the current inquiry is totally invalid the current sham of a so-called investigation is nothing more than an unconstitutional power grab it needs to end      corrupt adam schiff corrupt congressman adam schiff is angry that ambassadors that he thought would be good for his fraudulent witch hunt are turning out to be good for me some really good he's got all meetings locked down no transparency only his illegal leaks a very dishonest sleazebag republicans must stick together and fight  think of how many lives we saved in syria and turkey by getting a ceasefire yesterday thousands and thousands and maybe many more he is also my friend at the same time i am pleased to nominate deputy secretary dan brouillette to be the new secretary of energy dan's experience in the sector is unparalleled a total professional i have no doubt that dan will do a great job i want to thank secretary of energy rick perry for the outstanding job he has done he will be leaving at the end of the year to pursue other interests rick was a great governor of texas and a great secretary of energy can you believe i am doing this important work for our country and have to deal with corrupt adam schiff and the do nothing democrats at the same time it was not intended to be this way for a president defeat terrorism  i have just been notified that some european nations are now willing for the first time to take the isis fighters that came from their nations this is good news but should have been done after we captured them anyway big progress being made this thinking years ago instead it was always held together with very weak bandaids  in an artificial manner there is good will on both sides  a really good chance for success the us has secured the oil  the isis fighters are double secured by kurds  turkey just spoke to president  of turkey he told me there was minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated he very much wants the ceasefire or pause to work likewise the kurds want it and the ultimate solution to happen too bad there wasn't the usa  democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism and blatant corruption the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and the american dream   tonight we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the democrat party the fake news media and the rogue bureaucrats of the deep state the only message these radicals will understand is a crushing defeat on november 3 2020   the radical left tolerates no dissent it permits no opposition it accepts no compromise and it has absolutely no respect for the will of the american people they are coming after me because i am fighting for you    thank you dallas texas i love you    just arrived at the american airlines center in dallas texas will be out

unconventional path people have been trying to make this deal for many years millions of lives will be saved congratulations to all this deal could never have been made 3 days ago there needed to be some tough love in order to get it done great for everybody proud of all great news out of turkey news conference shortly with  and  thank you to  millions of lives will be saved this number based on

greatest witch hunt in american history  my warmest condolences to the family and many friends of congressman elijah cummings i got to see first hand the strength passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader his work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard if not impossible to replace this is the real story thank you jim  i am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops  bring them home from the ridiculous  costly endless wars and be scorned democrats always liked that position until i took it democrats always liked walls until i built them do you see what's happening here about 500000 human beings were killed in syria while barack obama was president  leading for a political settlement to that civil war media has been more outraged in the last 72 hours over our syria policy than they were at any point during 7 years of slaughter bucksexton rt  voters are rejecting the dems' baseless obstruction  socialist agenda and they're making their voices heard loud  clear su hope all house republicans and honest house democrats will vote to censure rep adam schiff tomorrow for his brazen and unlawful act of fabricating making up a totally phony conversation with the ukraine president and us president me most have never seen such a thing years of bad government such a sorry thing to see  what has happened here with the anthony wiener laptop the server all of the emails between huma abedin and hillary clinton the deleted clinton emails what is going on   joe d  victoria t thank you you dallas texas see you tomorrow night at the american

independence  not government coercion domination  control we were born free and will stay free as long as i am your president republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this impeachment witch hunt no lawyers no questions no transparency the good news is that the radical left dems have no case it is all based on their fraud and fabrication our record economy would crash just like in 1929 if any of those clowns became president 95percent approval rating in the republican party thank you just won two congressional seats in north carolina   a governors runoff in louisiana which republicans should now win because of impeachment fraud we will easily take back the house add in the senate  again win pres what is happening to president trump with impeachment is a constitutional travesty   the likes of which we have never seen before it is adam schiff and nancy pelosi who should be impeached for fraud you would think there is no way that any of the democrat candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become president of the united states now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal  absurd impeachment of one of the most successful presidents we now have the greatest economy in history  a great group of champions  looks good to me   it also brings shifty's fraudulent made up call which he read to the united states congress pretending it to be the words of president trump which they were not nancy pelosi is involved in this fraud in that she confirmed his fraudulent words on  and much more shifty adam schiff wants to rest his entire case on a whistleblower who he now says can't testify  the reason he can't testify is that he is afraid to do so because his account of the presidential telephone call is a fraud  totally different from the actual transcribed call the  amazing comeback reminds us to never give up  and never lose faith when you work hard support each other believe in yourself and give it everything you've got victory is always within reach   congratulations   now that we have found out that  is a virtual fraud rumor has it that jeff zucker will be resigining momentarily join me in dallas texas this thursday october

problems reminds me of crooked hillary and her 33000 deleted emails not recoverable democrats are allowing no transparency at the witch hunt hearings if republicans ever did this they would be excoriated by the fake news let the facts come out from the charade of people most of whom i do not know they are interviewing for 9 hours each not selective leaks shifty schiff now seems to think they don't need the whistleblower who started the whole scam the reason is that the whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the transcrpt also the second whistleblower is no longer even mentioned project veritas-obtained undercover videos highlight jeff zucker's  campaign to destroy trump videos reveal  bias   does this sound like a good or even great lawsuit a big scandal at  news they got caught using really gruesome fake footage of the turks bombing in syria a real disgrace tomorrow they will ask softball questions to sleepy joe biden's son hunter like why did ukraine  china pay you millions when you knew nothing payoff shifty schiff now seems to think they don't need the whistleblower who started the whole scam the reason is that the whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the transcript also the second whistleblower is no longer even mentioned the house gone rogue i want to remind you a little bit about the ring leader in this whole rogue operation against the president of the united states   it doesn't speak for the full house because the full house hasn't spoken the democrat party is pushing this impeachment this is a democrat party impeachment as i have been saying a silent coup effort   the democrat party has hijacked the house of representatives   statement from president donald j trump regarding turkey's actions in northeast syria  i would much rather focus on our southern border which abuts and is part of the united states of america and by the way numbers are way down and the wall is being built some people want the united states to protect the 7000 mile away border of syria presided over by bashar al-assad our enemy at the same time syria and whoever they chose to help wants naturally to protect the kurds and assad to protect the land of our enemy anyone who wants to assist syria in protecting the kurds is good with me whether it is russia china or napoleon bonaparte i hope they all do great we are 7000 miles away after defeating 100percent of the isis caliphate i largely moved our troops out of syria let syria and assad protect the kurds and fight turkey for their own land i said to my generals why should we be fighting for syria don't the europeans have a lot of responsibility  thank you katie i offered isis prisoners to the european countries from where they came and was rejected on numerous occasions they probably figured that the us would bear the tremendous cost as always to his credit the europeans didn't step up to deal with this isis problem  it's a lot of the reason why we are in this situation today now angela merkel of germany is finally stepping up and telling turkey to back off great new book resistance at all costs how trump haters are breaking america out by kimberley strassel of the wall street journal kim has treated us fairly and for that i am very appreciative check it out today it is great of the correction which they knew about full well fox news pollster braun research misrepresented impeachment poll analysis  the fox impeachment poll has turned out to be incorrect this was announced on friday despite this the corrupt new york times used this poll in one of its stories no mention america first wow hunter biden is being forced to leave a chinese company now watch the fake news wrap their greasy and very protective arms around him only softball questions of him please will be looking into the scott hapgood case and the island of anguilla something looks and sounds very wrong i know anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved     vote for good guy  tonight on dancing with the stars he has always been there for us happy columbus day the same people who got us into the middle east mess are the people who most want to stay there kurds may be releasing some to get us involved easily recaptured by turkey or european nations from where many came but they should move quickly big sanctions on turkey coming do people really think we should go to war with nato member turkey never ending wars will end brian kilmeade over at  got it all wrong we are not going into another war between people who have been fighting with each other for 200 years europe had a chance to get their isis prisoners but didn't want the cost let the usa pay they said former democrat senator harry reid just stated that donald trump is very smart much more popular than people think is underestimated and will be hard to beat in the 2020 election thank you harry i agree democrat's game was foiled when we caught schiff fraudulently making up my ukraine conversation when i released the exact conversation transcript and when ukrainian president and the foreign minister said there was no pressure very normal talk a total impeachment scam adam schiff now doesn't seem to want the whistleblower to testify no must testify to explain why he got my ukraine conversation sooo wrong not even close did schiff tell him to do that we must determine the whistleblower's identity to determine why this was done to the usa the democrats are trashing this president  in the process trashing the us constitution frankly the american people need to wake up to the reality that the democrats are so drunk on power that they're willing to destroy this constitutional republic   serial killers get more due process than the democrats give to the president of the united states  somebody please explain to chris wallace of fox who will never be his father and my friend mike wallace that the phone conversation i had with the president of ukraine was a congenial  good one it was only schiff's made up version of that conversation that was bad the us has the worst of the isis prisoners turkey and the kurds must not let them escape europe should have taken them back after numerous requests they should do it now they will never come to or be allowed in the united states  on  is doing a big show tonight on the democrat's impeachment scam 10:00 pm no guests just mark he is angry like so many others at 9:00 pm on  steve hilton is looking into the crooked bidens where's hunter by the way don't call me again i'll call you when you've done what i've asked' a reminder that wasn't just stupid it was false     i never said this schiff made it up and read it to congress  the american people end witch hunt congressman adam schiff who when seeing the real ukraine phone call transcript decided he'd better make up one of his own ‘i'm going to say this only seven times so you better listen good i want you to make up dirt on my political opponent understand lots of it and china has already begun agricultural purchases from our great patriot farmers  ranchers i agreed not to increase tariffs from 25percent to 30percent on october 15th they will remain at 25percent the relationship with china is very good we will finish out the large phase one part of the deal then head directly into phase two the phase one deal can be finalized  signed soon my deal with china is that they will immediately start buying very large quantities of our agricultural product not wait until the deal is signed over the next 3 or 4 weeks they have already started likewise financial services and other deal aspects start preparing the democrats are going to lose a lot of house seats because of their fraudulent use of impeachment schiff fabricated phone call a crime democrat senate seats will also be put at risk even some that were supposedly safe look at louisiana last night north carolina last week happy birthday   we have become a far greater economic power than ever before and we are using that power for world peace where's hunter he has totally disappeared now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries media is awol dealing with  and many members of congress including democrats about imposing powerful sanctions on turkey treasury is ready to go additional legislation may be sought there is great consensus on this turkey has asked that it not be done stay tuned the kurds and turkey have been fighting for many years turkey considers the pkk the worst terrorists of all others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other let them we are monitoring the situation closely endless wars do you remember two years ago when iraq was going to fight the kurds in a different part of syria many people wanted us to fight with the kurds against iraq who we just fought for i said no and the kurds left the fight twice now the same thing is happening with turkey very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the turkish border for a change those that mistakenly got us into the middle east wars are still pushing to fight they have no idea what a bad decision they have made why are they not asking for a declaration of war the media is not talking about the big republican victory last night in louisiana where a sitting democrat governor was forced into a runoff by not getting 50percent big upset now  who will be a great governor will win a despicable human being  congratulations to the great state of louisiana a big night you will soon have a new and wonderful governor  your taxes and car insurance payments will go down the same people that got us into the middle east quicksand 8 trillion dollars and many thousands of lives and millions of lives when you count the other side are now fighting to keep us there don't listen to people that haven't got a clue they have proven to be inept the governor of louisiana john bel edwards has done a poor job now he is in a runoff with a great republican  thank you louisiana 66percent down to 47percent after i explained what a bad job the governor was doing the endless wars must end start thinking about getting bigger tractors  that is the real story  happy national farmers day  so now they are after the legendary crime buster and greatest mayor in the

amendment fantastic being with you last night other aspects of the deal are also great technology financial services 16-20 billion in boeing planes etc but wow the farmers really hit pay dirt      thank you to all republicans in congress for your invaluable help the deal i just made with china is by far the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our great patriot farmers in the history of our country in fact there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced our farmers will figure it out thank you china the case of major mathew golsteyn is now under review at the white house mathew is a highly decorated green beret who is being tried for killing a taliban bombmaker we train our boys to be killing machines then prosecute them when they kill  schiff aides worked

add a great new republican governor to the beautiful louisiana mix see you tonight one of the great things about the china deal is the fact that for various reasons we do not have to go through the

get republicans to vote for either of our two great republican candidates and force a run off with john bel edwards who has done a really poor job of tax cutting car insurance cost worst in usa  is

of minnesota in 2020    a great evening in minneapolis minnesota with incredible american patriots thank you  the joint statement released with president bolsonaro in march makes absolutely clear that i support brazil beginning the process for full oecd membership the united states stands by that statement and stands by  this article is fake news  wow thank you minneapolis minnesota  on my way   we have one of three choices send in thousands of troops and win militarily hit turkey very hard financially and with sanctions or mediate a deal between turkey and the kurds we defeated 100percent of the isis caliphate and no longer have any troops in the area under attack by turkey in syria we did our job perfectly now turkey is attacking the kurds who have been fighting each other for 200 years big day of negotiations with china they want to make a deal but do i i meet with the vice premier tomorrow at the white house why isn't the ig investigating his so-called whistleblower all bad info the president of the ukraine just stated again in the strongest of language that president trump applied no pressure and did absolutely nothing wrong he used the strongest language possible that should end this democrat scam but it won't because the dems  media are fixed thank you to  one america news for your fair coverage and brilliant reporting it is appreciated by many people trying so hard to find a new consistent and powerful voice see you tonight at the big rally in minneapolis the area and start a new war all over again turkey is a member of nato others say stay out let the kurds fight their own battles even with our financial help i say hit turkey very hard financially  with sanctions if they don't play by the rules i am watching closely turkey has been planning to attack the kurds for a long time they have been fighting forever we have no soldiers or military anywhere near the attack area i am trying to end the endless wars talking to both sides some want us to send tens of thousands of soldiers to where is hunter biden he has disappeared while the fake news protects his crooked daddy  court justice  i turned him down he's been terrible ever since shep smith  who gave crooked hillary the debate questions  got fired from   others  doesn't deliver for us anymore it is so different than it used to be oh well i'm president from the day i announced i was running for president i have never had a good  poll whoever their pollster is they suck but  is also much different than it used to be in the good old days with people like andrew napolitano who wanted to be a supreme ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky told reporters thursday his controversial july call with president trump involved no bribe blackmail or quid pro quo as impeachment-minded democrats claim this should immediately end the talk of impeachment  in case the kurds or turkey lose control the united states has already taken the 2 isis militants tied to beheadings in syria known as the beetles out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the us they are the worst of the worst impeached for what having created the greatest economy in the history of our country building our strongest ever military cutting taxes too much  a different take  i don't think it's a whistleblower at all i think this is an anonymous source for the democratic staff in the house of representatives this is an insult to real whistleblowers actual whistleblowers go on to have their whole lives upended john kiriakou   the hardest thing i have to do as president  sleepy joe biden  so pathetic to see sleepy joe biden who with his son hunter and to the detriment of the american taxpayer has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars calling for my impeachment and i did nothing wrong joe's failing campaign gave him no other choice only 25 percent want the president impeached which is pretty low considering the volume of fake news coverage but pretty high considering the fact that i did nothing wrong it is all just a continuation of the greatest scam and witch hunt in the history of our country so why is someone a good or great president if they needed to spy on someone else's campaign in order to win that didn't work out so well and if they were unable to fill 142 important federal judgeships a record by far handing them all to me to choose will have 182 soon daca stand with all of its negative legal implications the republicans and democrats will have a deal to let them stay in our country in very short order it would actually benefit daca and be done the right way president obama said that he did not have the right to sign daca that it will never hold up in court he signed it anyway if the supreme court upholds daca it gives the president extraordinary powers far greater than ever thought if they do what is right and do not let crooked hillary should try it again  true should have never been there in the first place  why doesn't the icig do something about this scam he should have never let it start a dem hoax  adam schiff is a disgrace to our country  so true don and this was a big lie look what happened to friends of trump for less can't let this pass  but we are now for the first time giving companies a better alternative  great support from gop in fighting the radical left do nothing democrats  they don't have a clue but i do the usa is doing great despite the fed  no pressure at all said ukraine very congenial a perfect call the whistleblower and others spoke before seeing the transcript now they must apologize to me and stop this ridiculous impeachment the so-called whistleblower before knowing i was going to release the exact transcript stated that my call with the ukrainian president was crazy frightening and completely lacking in substance related to national security this is a very big lie read the transcript the do nothing democrats are con artists only looking to hurt the republican party and president their total focus is 2020 nothing more and nothing less the good news is that we will win in the history of our country we went to war under a false  now disproven premise weapons of mass destruction there were none now we are slowly  carefully bringing our great soldiers  military home our focus is on the big picture the usa is greater than ever before the united states has spent eight trillion dollars fighting and policing in the middle east thousands of our great soldiers have died or been badly wounded millions of people have died on the other side going into the middle east is the worst decision ever made fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years usa should never have been in middle east moved our 50 soldiers out turkey must take over captured isis fighters that europe refused to have returned the stupid endless wars for us are ending  so make all member countries pay not just the united states  he should be impeached for fraud  the whistleblower's lawyer is a big democrat the whistleblower has ties to one of my democrat opponents why does the icig allow this scam to continue the whistleblower's facts have been so incorrect about my no pressure conversation with the ukrainian president and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a democrat candidate that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly this is no whistleblower a total scam by the do nothing democrats for the good of the country this wirch hunt should end now  so amazing  wow just breaking the big deal whistleblower had a ‘professional tie' to 2020 democratic candidate washington examiner   in other words was working with someone who was potentially running against me why wasn't this reported by the icig a witch hunt scam so why is someone a good or great president if they needed to spy on someone else's campaign in order to win that didn't work out so well and if they were unable to fill 142 important federal judgeships a record by far handing them all to me to chose will have 182 soon bob mueller was pursuing the fbi director job when he met with president trump in 2017 administration officials say   bret baier and jake gibson  this is true even though mueller denied it the greatest witch hunt in the history of the usa  gasoline prices in the state of california are much higher than anywhere else in the nation $250 vs $450 i guess those very expensive and unsafe cars that they are mandating just aren't doing the trick don't worry california relief is on the way the state doesn't get it if there is a runoff in louisiana you will have a great new republican governor who will cut your taxes and car insurance and do a fabulous job for you and your family vote republican the party of honest abe lincoln big rally in louisiana on friday night must force a runoff with a liberal democrat governor john bel edwards who has let your taxes and car insurance get too high and will never protect your 2nd amendment vote for one of our two great republicans on saturday force a runoff this is just the beginning thank you to   the us border is secure  in fact the cops for trump t-shirt web site crashed because of incredible volume but is now back up and running proceeds go to the police union charities see you on thursday night in minneapolis radical left dem mayor of minneapolis jacob frey is doing everything possible to stifle free speech despite a record sell-out crowd at the target center presidents clinton and obama paid almost nothing the minneapolis police have been incredible friday night in louisiana will be great big crowd expected republicans must get out and vote for either of our two incredible candidates    so we can stop left leaning governor john bel edwards from getting over 50percent we will easily win the runoff  hasn't adam schiff been fully discredited by now do we have to continue listening to his lies get your great t-shirts cops for trump at   really nice thank you to minneapolis police officers  union  someone please tell the radical left mayor of minneapolis that he can't price out free speech probably illegal i stand strongly  proudly with the great police officers and law enforcement of minneapolis and the great state of minnesota see you thursday night thank you to lt bob kroll of the great minneapolis police department for your kind words on  the police are fighting the radical left mayor and his ridiculous uniform ban actually i love the cops for trump shirts want to bring some home i am with you 100percent i think that crooked hillary clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from uber left elizabeth warren only one condition the crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how  why she deleted 33000 emails after getting c subpoena to see importantly ambassador sondland's tweet which few report stated i believe you are incorrect about president trump's intentions the president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind that says it all i would love to send ambassador sondland a really good man and great american to testify but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court where republican's rights have been taken away and true facts are not allowed out for the public understands that while we only had 50 soldiers remaining in that section of syria and they have been removed any unforced or unnecessary fighting by turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency we are helping the kurds financially/weapons we may be in the process of leaving syria but in no way have we abandoned the kurds who are special people and wonderful fighters likewise our relationship with turkey a nato and trading partner has been very good turkey already has a large kurdish population and fully good health at my request pastor brunson who had many years of a long prison term remaining also remember and importantly that turkey is an important member in good standing of nato he is coming to the us as my guest on november 13th  so many people conveniently forget that turkey is a big trading partner of the united states in fact they make the structural steel frame for our f-35 fighter jet they have also been good to deal with helping me to save many lives at idlib province and returning in very the lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters 72000 ticket requests already dump frey and omar make america great again  thank you joni  adam should be impeached  great book  rt  lawmakers in both chambers have demanded that ic ig michael atkinson explain why he backdated to august secret changes he mad there are no felonies there are no impeachable offenses the constitution's very clear that you need bribery treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors you can't be impeached for the conduct that's been alleged in this case  dershowitz   a scam thank you   the captured isis fighters and families the us has done far more than anyone could have ever expected including the capture of 100percent of the isis caliphate it is time now for others in the region some of great wealth to protect their own territory the usa is great as i have stated strongly before and just to reiterate if turkey does anything that i in my great and unmatched wisdom consider to be off limits i will totally destroy and obliterate the economy of turkey i've done before they must with europe and others watch over down watching over a quagmire  spending big dollars to do so when i took over our military was totally depleted now it is stronger than ever before the endless and ridiculous wars are ending we will be focused on the big picture knowing we can always go back  blast i was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars where our great military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don't even like the usa the two most unhappy countries at this move are russia  china because they love seeing us bogged the radical left democrats have failed on all fronts so now they are pushing local new york city and state democrat prosecutors to go get president trump a thing like this has never happened to any president before not even close doesn't even include the almost $2000 that the families got from the trump tax cut stephen moore freedomworks  that means $5000 to $6000 more in disposable yearly income that americans have right now because of president trump heritage foundation these numbers are blockbusters just since donald trump took office median family incomrs are up over $4100 in 8 years under president obama they only went up $1000 in one third the time president trump has increased incomes 4 times as much and that incomes much higher under trump than bush obama  and almost everything else is better also except i am driving the deep state and the radical left do nothing democrats crazy ig declassified information contradicts the whistleblower   but why are people surprised the partisan whistleblower was very wrong on what was said on my perfect no pressure call with the ukrainian president bring in another whistleblower from the bench we just won the big court case on net neutrality rules a great win for the future and speed of the internet will lead to many big things including 5g congratulations to the fcc and its chairman ajit pai figure the situation out and what they want to do with the captured isis fighters in their neighborhood they all hate isis have been enemies for years we are 7000 miles away and will crush isis again if they come anywhere near us almost 3 years but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous endless wars many of them tribal and bring our soldiers home we will fight where it is to our benefit and only fight to win turkey europe syria iran iraq russia and the kurds will now have to again said no thinking as usual that the us is always the sucker on nato on trade on everything the kurds fought with us but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so they have been fighting turkey for decades i held off this fight for including capturing thousands of isis fighters mostly from europe but europe did not want them back they said you keep them usa i said no we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in us prisons at tremendous cost they are yours for trials they the united states was supposed to be in syria for 30 days that was many years ago we stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight when i arrived in washington isis was running rampant in the area we quickly defeated 100percent of the isis caliphate this makes nervous nancy every bit as guilty as liddle' adam schiff for high crimes and misdemeanors and even treason i guess that means that they along with all of those that evilly colluded with them must all be immediately impeached nancy pelosi knew of all of the many shifty adam schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon congress and the american people in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan whistleblower  lawyer  forgot to report that we are helping the great farmers of the usa to the tune of 28 billion dollars for the last two years paid for out of tariffs paid to the united states by china for targeting the farmer they devalued their currency therefore paying the cost unemployment rate just dropped to 35percent the lowest in more that 50 years is that an impeachable event for your president gerry baker of   do you think what you've seen rises to the level of impeachment ken starr clinton special prosecutor i don't sleepy eyes chuck todd of meet the press had a total meltdown in his interview with highly reaspected senator  seems that a not very bright chuck just wasn't getting the answers he was looking for in order to make me look as bad as possible i did nothing wrong join me at the target center in minneapolis minnesota this thursday october 10th at 7:00pm tickets   good job i must say by bob woodward on deface the

a runoff and have a great new republican governor voting on saturday information for rally to follow  and by the way i would love running against 1percent joe biden i just don't think it's going to happen sleepy joe won't get to the starting gate  based on all of the money he  his family probably extorted joe should hang it up i wouldn't want him dealing with china  u the biden family was paid off pure and simple the fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable sleepy joe said he never spoke to the ukrainian company and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and hunter and separately got 15 billion dollars from china despite no experience and for no apparent reason there is no way these can be legitimate transactions as lawyers  others have stated as president i have an obligation to look into possible or probable corruption it is incredible to watch and read the fake news and how they pull out all stops to protect sleepy joe biden and his thrown out of the military son hunter who was handed $100000 a month plusplus from a ukrainian based company even though he had no experience in energy the democrats are lucky that they don't have any mitt romney types they may be lousy politicians with really bad policies open borders sanctuary cities etc but they stick together 95percent approval rating in republican party thank you the do nothing democrats are being exposed  the great scam is being revealed  the first so-called second hand information whistleblower got my phone conversation almost completely wrong so now word is they are going to the bench and another whistleblower is coming in from the deep state also with second hand info meet with shifty keep them coming president trump would be negligent if he did not bring this matter biden up if the vp of the us is self enriching  engaged in criminal behavior at a minimum corrupt behavior it ought to be looked at peter schweizer author secret empires  schiff and the do nothing dems have lost all credibilitybut the corrupt media is working hard to keep them in the game  mitt get off the stage you've had your turn twice  so crooked hillary clinton can delete and acid wash 33000 emails after getting a subpoena from the united states congress but i can't make one totally appropriate telephone call to the president of ukraine witch hunt no kevin jeff flake is better  i'm hearing that the great people of utah are considering their vote for their pompous senator mitt romney to be a big mistake i agree he is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the do nothing democrats  not only are the do nothing democrats interfering in the 2020 election but they are continuing to interfere in the 2016 election they must be stopped schiff is a fraud   this is the real story   mitt romney never knew how to win he is a pompous ass who has been fighting me from the beginning except when he begged me for my endorsement for his senate run i gave it to him and when he begged me to be secretary of state i didn't give it to him he is so bad for r's somebody please wake up mitt romney and tell him that my conversation with the ukrainian president was a congenial and very appropriate one and my statement on china pertained to corruption not politics if mitt worked this hard on obama he could have won sadly he choked the so-called whistleblower's account of my perfect phone call is way off not even close schiff and pelosi never thought i would release the transcript of the call got them by surprise they got caught this is a fraud against the american people the media is fixed and corrupt it bears no relationship to the truth the    are pure fiction totally dishonest reporting new extreme dems now running the party  thank you  and   shifty schiff duped by russian pranksters  too bad  thank you   report ‘whistleblower' never disclosed contact with house intel panel to inspector general great book  pelosi blatantly lies during  interview about schiff's reading of ukraine transcript where is the lamestream media on this  thanks jim would be great to just run our country  ex-envoy testified ukraine or the president of ukraine never raised quid pro quo concerns with him source    the president of ukraine also stated that he was not pressured by me in any way end of case of ukraine and cannot find any reason to charge the president with high crimes  misdemeanors this is just a phony witch hunt perpetuated by democrats to get rid of trump because they cannot beat him in a fair election  richard ketay it isn't often i get angry at the dirty politics of the democrats in congress but this time i am enraged and hope this impeachment charade will backfire on reps pelosi  schiff  the democrats i have read thoroughly the telephone conversation between trump  the president along with pelosi and her boss aoc the do nothing democrat leader  join me at the target center in minneapolis minnesota

statement of the president of the united states me he did it to fool congress and the public in order to make me look bad he is a sick puppy adam schiff's connection to the whistleblower is coming to light   these facts and others make it impossible for the ridiculous impeachment scam to go forward schiff has also committed a crime perhaps treason in making up a horrible statement and reading lyin' shifty schiff  when your making an unsubstantiated charge that the president of the united states is making a request having to do with quid pro quo this witness has blown a big hole into that statementthe ambassador put a dagger in the heart of schiffs fairytale  rep lee zeldin  i have just officially nominated poland for entry into the visa waiver program with this decades long-awaited announcement we are in the final steps of the process which when complete would grant polish nationals visa-free business and tourism travel to the us  vice versa at the request of  i have declared a

for all wow this is big stuff  i think it's outrages that a whistleblower is a cia agent  ed rollins  the witness was asked at least 20 times and there definitely was no quid pro quo     their whole case was built around this now they no longer mention when your making an unsubstantiated statement that the president is making a claim having to do with quid pro quo this witness has blown a big hole into that statement the ambassador put a dagger in the heart of schiffs fairytale  rep lee zeldin the whistleblower who had the facts wrong about the phone call reached out and more to the democrat controlled house intelligence committee schiff never told us about this breaking news unemployment rate at 35percent drops to a 50 year low wow america lets impeach your president even though he did nothing wrong as president i have an obligation to end corruption even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries it is done all the time this has nothing to do with politics or a political campaign against the bidens this does have to do with their corruption the washington times ukraine envoy blows ‘massive hole' into democrat accusations republicans at hearing find no trump pressure the ukrainian president also strongly stated that no pressure was put on him case closed nancy pelosi today on  actually said that adam schiffty schiff didn't fabricate my words in a major speech before congress she either had no idea what she was saying in other words lost it or she lied even clinton lover  strongly called her out sue her they do nothing dems are trying to nullify an election joe digenova  this isn't about a campaign this is about corruption on a massive scale  we are simultaneously fighting the fake news media and their partner the democrat party

have time to get it done  rt  today at the villages in florida it was my great honor to sign an executive order on protecting and improving medicar another big loss for the do nothing dems  as the president of the united states i have an absolute right perhaps even a duty to investigate or have investigated corruption and that would include asking or suggesting other countries to help us out blowing massive holes inside of the theory the narrative that chairman schiff has been providing to the public   the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country  today at the villages in florida it was my great honor to sign an executive order on protecting and improving medicare for our nation's seniors today's action is only the latest of many important steps we are taking to dramatically improve healthcare for the american people  it was just a congenial phone call but its become so big i've never seen the media work so hard with so little    witch hunt thank you  really well done  drain the swamp  this is yet again an example of democrats projecting their criminal acts on president trump president trump is an innocent man it is a lawless coup attempt against a duly elected president   trump fundraising haul shows impeachment backfiring on dems  there wasn't anything said wrong in my conversation with the ukrainian president this is a democrat scam great time at the villages in florida today sorry we couldn't get everybody in i will be back soon  election interference 95percent approval rating in the republican party and record setting fundraising that has taken

had such support  book is doing really well a study in unfairness to a potentially great justice  thank you hugh  a great book by a brilliant author buy it now  great job richard  keep up the great

badly on trade due to tariffs trade barriers and more this case going on for years a nice victory rt  look at this photograph  democrats want to steal the election   he loves our military and supports

second amendment look at this photograph  schiff house intel chairman got early account of whistle-blower's accusations schiff is a fraud   the do nothing democrats should be focused on building up our country not wasting everyone's time and energy on bullshit which is what they have been doing ever since i got overwhelmingly elected in 2016 223-306 get a better candidate this time you'll need it adam schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains honor and strength of secretary of state mike pompeo for a lowlife like schiff who completely fabricated my words and read them to congress as though they were said by me to demean a first in class at west point is sad democrats are trying to undo the election regardless of facts  nancy pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices  working on the desperately needed usmca she is incapable of working on either it is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment the do nothing democrats are stuck in mud all of this impeachment nonsense which is going nowhere is driving the stock market and your 401k's down but that is exactly what the democrats want to do they are willing to hurt the country with only the 2020 election in mind now the press is trying to sell the fact that i wanted a moat stuffed with alligators and snakes with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top at our southern border i may be tough on border security but not that tough the press has gone crazy fake news nancy pelosi and the democrats haven't met the standards of impeachment they have to be very careful here jeanne zaino   all the do nothing democrats are focused on is impeaching the president for having a very good conversation with the ukrainian president i knew that many people were listening even have a transcript they have been at this stuff from the day i got elected bad for country congressman adam schiff should resign for the crime of after reading a transcript of my conversation with the president of ukraine it was perfect fraudulently fabricating a statement of the president of the united states and reading it to congress as though mine he is sick massive sections of the wall are being built at our southern border it is going up rapidly and built to the highest standards and specifications of the border patrol experts it is actually an amazing structure our us military is doing a great job i won the right to be a presidential candidate in california in a major court decision handed down yesterday it was filed against me by the radical left governor of that state to tremendous media hoopla the victory however was barely covered by the fake news no surprise louisiana republicans must go out and vote republican in your governor's race a republican will win if you can force a runoff early voting has started your 2nd amendment and much else is at stake now the press is trying to sell the fact that i wanted a moot stuffed with alligators and snakes with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top at our southern border i may be tough on border security but not that tough the press has gone crazy fake news the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country  people their vote their freedoms their second amendment religion military border wall and their god-given rights as a citizen of the united states of america as i learn more and more each day i am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment it is a coup intended to take away the power of the a nancy pelosi/chuck schumer democrat john bel edwards who does nothing but stymie all of the things we are doing to make america great again don't be fooled john bel edwards will never be for us early voting has already started  republicans of louisiana it is really important for you to go out and vote on october 12th for either eddie rispone or ralph abraham both great which will lead to a runoff against why isn't congressman adam schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to congress as if this statement which was very dishonest and bad for me was directly made by the president of the united states this should never be allowed as i predicted jay powell and the federal reserve have allowed the dollar to get so strong especially relative to all other currencies that our manufacturers are being negatively affected fed rate too high they are their own worst enemies they don't have a clue pathetic the whistleblower and also the person who gave all of the false information to him this is simply about a phone conversation that could not have been nicer warmer or better no pressure at all as confirmed by  ukrainian pres it is just another democrat hoax so if the so-called whistleblower has all second hand information and almost everything he has said about my perfect call with the ukrainian president is wrong much to the embarrassment of pelosi  schiff why aren't we entitled to interview  learn everything about the congratulatory phone call with the ukrainian president was perfect unless you heard liddle' adam schiff's fraudulently made up version of the call this is just another fake news media together with their partner the democrat party hoax rt  our new data shows  approval rating has increased since this same time a week ago the american peop congratulations to president xi and the chinese people on the 70th anniversary of the people's republic of china great job just in time  you cannot judge my stock market performance since the

the 20th chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general mark milley  the fake news media wants to stay as far away as possible from the ukraine and china deals made by the bidens a corrupt media is so bad for our country in actuality the media may be even more corrupt than the bidens which is hard to do very simple i was looking for corruption and also why germany france and others in the european union don't do more for ukraine why is it always the usa that does so much and puts up so much money for ukraine and other countries by the way the bidens were corrupt they made this whole thing up impeachment is also a pre-emptive strike for what they think is coming on the obama administration's handling of the 2016 election jim mclaughlin highly respected pollster   president trump's job approval numbers have just reached the highest level since his inauguration around 50percent and you can add to that many votes from voters that don't talk about their vote once they saw the president's numbers going up they said ‘we gotta do something' so  who changed the long standing whistleblower rules just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report drain the swamp again the president of ukraine said there was no zero pressure put on him by me case closed again the president of the ukraine said there was no zero pressure put on him by me end of case place in trade it's taking shape in military competition johnathan ward author and china expert we are winning and we will win they should not have broken the deal we had with them happy birthday china after many years the united states is finally waking up to beijing's plans and ambitions to pass us as the dominant economic  military superpower in the 21st century what's happening now is that the us is finally responding thank you president trump this is taking rep adam schiff illegally made up a fake  terrible statement pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the ukrainian president and read it aloud to congress and the american people it bore no relationship to what i said on the call arrest for treason the fake whistleblower complaint is not holding up it is mostly about the call to the ukrainian president which in the name of transparency i immediately released to congress   the public the whistleblower knew almost nothing its 2nd hand description of the call is a fraud china trade turmoil china urging a calm and rational solution   china is doing very poorly while the usa under your favorite president's leadership continues to soar to new heights and despite the do nothing democrats we have just begun the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country this is about proving that donald trump was framed by the democrats   if the democrats are successful in removing the president from office which they will never be it will cause a civil war like fracture in this nation from which our country will never heal pastor robert jeffress  election and negate the votes of millions of evangelicals in the process they know the only impeachable offense that president trump has committed was beating hillary clinton in 2016 that's the unpardonable sin for which the democrats will never forgive him rid of donald j trump and the democrats don't care if they burn down and destroy this nation in the process i have never seen the evangelical christians more angry over any issue than this attempt to illegitimately remove this president from office overturn the 2016 nancy pelosi and the democrats can't put down the impeachment match they know they couldn't beat him in 2016 against hillary clinton and they're increasingly aware of the fact that they won't win against him in 2020 and impeachment is the only tool they have to get state department has stepped up hillary clinton email probe   you mean the 33000 emails that she has deleted and acid washed so they can never be found even though she said that all 33000 pertained only to her daughter's wedding and her yoga we are going to have an election very shortly rep jeff van drew democrat of new jersey   thank you just another witch hunt by nancy pelosi and the do nothing democrats all that's swirling around us now is impeachment we talk about it day and night it's what's on the news there is nothing that has turned up that is impeachable our founding fathers set impeachment to be extremely rare we need to get good stuff done let the people vote these radical left do nothing democrats are doing great harm to our country they are lying  cheating like never before in our country's history in order to destabilize the united states of america  it's upcoming 2020 election they  the fake news media are dangerous  bad in addition i want to meet not only my accuser who presented second  third hand information but also the person who illegally gave this information which was largely incorrect to the whistleblower was this person spying on the us president big consequences his lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great chamber he wrote down and read terrible things then said it was from the mouth of the president of the united states i want schiff questioned at the highest level for fraud  treason like every american i deserve to meet my accuser especially when this accuser the so-called whistleblower represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way then schiff made up what i actually said by lying to congress wishing a happy new year

doing namely the usmca vote prescription drug price reduction gun safety infrastructure and much more wow they got caught end the witch hunt now  fraudulently and illegally inserted his made up  twisted words into my call with the ukrainian president to make it look like i did something very wrong he then boldly read those words to congress and millions of people defaming  libeling me he must resign from congress the whistleblower's complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new president of ukraine the so-called whistleblower knew practically nothing in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic  wrong just like liddle' adam schiff the conversation with the new and very good ukraine president who told the fake news at the united nations that he was not pressured by me in any way shape or form should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent witch hunt others ended in ashes how do you impeach a president who has

years to hurt the republican party and president has just said that the whistleblower even though he or she only had second hand information is credible how can that be with zero info and a known bias democrat scam adam schiff has zero credibility another fantasy to hurt the republican party a whistleblower with second hand information another fake news story see what was said on the very nice no pressure call another witch hunt that and many other reasons is why republicans will win north carolina  is there a case for impeachment absolutely not there is no high crime or misdemeanor no crime

true but it will never work  is their a case for impeachment absolutely not there is no high crimes or misdemeanors no treason no extortion no treason rd robert ray respected taken out of ukraine and china additionally i demand transparency from democrats that went to ukraine and attempted to force the new president to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat i have informed  kevin mccarthy and all republicans in the house that i fully support transparency on so-called whistleblower information but also insist on transparency from joe biden and his son hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily wow ukraine whistleblower's lead attorney donated to biden  he president trump didn't specifically mention the explicit quid pro quo ofunless you investigate thiswe're going to withhold military aid to you pamela brown you don't see a direct quid pro quo in this  democrats wrote to the ukrainian government in may 2018 urging it to continue investigations into president donald trump's alleged collusion with russia in the 2016 presidential campaign  collusion later found not to exist  will the democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the ukrainian president they should a perfect call got them by surprise the democrats have been talking about impeaching donald trump since before he was inaugurated     and for no reason other than the great success we are having with the economy the military vets tax and regulation cuts healthcare and so much more there has been no president in the history of our country who has been treated so badly as i have the democrats are frozen with hatred and fear they get nothing done this should never be allowed to happen to another president witch hunt great new book by the brilliant andrew mccarthy ball of collusion the plot to rig an election and destroy a presidency get it and some other great new books which i will soon be recommending they tell you about the crooked pols and the witch hunt that has now been exposed thank you  and   thank you   he trump has already been suffering from this type of a witch hunt since before his inauguration if it's not one thing it's another it's a disgrace    sooooo true   thank you  -- totally agree  they dems are scrambling for a theme and narrative they've gone everywhere from russian hoax to russian collusionand now they've come to thisthey think they should have won the 2016 election they think in their bizarre brains that they did  mark levin media trying to protect biden ignoring massive democrat scandal  attorney for anti-trump ‘whistleblower' worked for hillary clinton chuck schumer  secretary of state pompeo recieved permission from ukraine government to release the transcript of the telephone call i had with their president they don't know either what the big deal is a total witch hunt scam by the democrats presidential harassment they never even saw the transcript of the call a total witch hunt pelosi nadler schiff and of course maxine waters can you believe this such an important day at the united nations so much work and so much success and the democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news witch hunt garbage so bad for our country the democrats are so focused on hurting the republican party and the president that they are unable to get anything done because of it including legislation on gun safety lowering of prescription drug prices infrastructure etc so bad for our country thank you  you will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call no pressure and unlike joe biden and his son no quid pro quo this is nothing more than a continuation of the greatest and most destructive witch hunt of all time i am currently at the united nations representing our country but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with president zelensky of ukraine hopefully they will work it out and quickly  true a wonderful meeting  she seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future so nice to see   bombshell information reports that the so-called whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge of that phone conversation with ukraine's president wow  it is all a democrat/adam schiff scam doing this for 3 years now and found nothing   94percent approval rating in the republican party thank you thank you working hard  this is the real corruption that the fake news media refuses to even acknowledge  know the correct facts is he on our country's side where does he come from is this all about schiff  the democrats again after years of being wrong the very thing that they are accusing president trump of doing which i didn't do was actually done by joe biden continues to be a double standard     these people are stone cold crooked also who is this so-called whistleblower who doesn't just leaving the great state of ohio for new york and a few big days at the united nations your country will be well represented breaking news the ukrainian government just said they weren't pressured at all during the nice call sleepy joe biden on the other hand forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son's company by threat of not giving big dollars to ukraine that's the real story now the fake news media says i pressured the ukrainian president at least 8 times during my telephone call with him this supposedly comes from a so-called whistleblower who they say doesn't even have a first hand account of what was said more democrat/crooked media con incredible  the usa loves india  justice kavanaugh should sue the failing new york times for all they are worth look forward to being with our great india loving community  the  is trying to make someone justice kavanaugh into an evil person when they don't have the information to back it up it is a false hoax    zero people were fired at the times why will be in houston to be with my friend will be a great day in texas  they are trying to destroy and influence justice kavanaugh a very good man   100percent correct and they should be fully exposed for what they are i go along with joe  go across the world and you'll see either very low interest rates or negative rates the president wants to be competitive with these other countries on this but i don't think he'll fire jay powell even if i should we should always be paying less interest than others the real story involves hunter biden going around the world and collecting large payments from foreign governments and foreign oligarchs peter schweizer  laura ingraham hunter made a fortune in ukraine and in china he knew nothing about energy or anything else when someone gets nominated overwhelmingly and then wins the election as he did then he gets to set the national agenda the press is just outrages this  story is the most irresponsible thing i've ever seen    i agree they also lose too much the fake news media nowadays not only doesn't check for the accuracy of the facts they knowingly make up the facts they even make up sources in order to protect their partners the democrats it is so wrong but they don't even care anymore they have gone totally crazy the lamestream media had a very bad week they pushed numerous phony stories and got caught especially the failing new york times which has lost more money over the last 10 years than any paper in history and the amazon washington post they are the enemy of the people ukraine foreign minister disputes reports of any pressure from trump this conversation was long friendly and it touched on many questions   correct if your looking for something done wrong just look at the tape of sleepy joe he is being protected by the media they're trying to turn what was a biden scandal into a trump scandal  the problem is trump did nothing wrong with a foreign leader was this person officially asked to listen to the conversation or was he or she secretly listening in  it appears that an american spy in one of our intelligence agencies may have been spying on our own president the complaint suggests that this intel agent was listening in on trump's conversation the pretend ukraine scandal is an another malicious seditious effort to protect the obama/clinton gang criminal classified leaks and spying targeting trump  again  some of the best economic numbers our country has ever experienced are happening right now this is despite a crooked and demented deep state and a probably illegal democrat/fake news media partnership the likes of which the world has never seen make america great again now that the democrats and the fake news media have gone bust on every other of their witch hunt schemes they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others call it the ukraine witch hunt while at the same time trying to protect sleepy joe biden will fail again this is the real and only story  story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation i had with the new president of the ukraine nothing was said that was in any way wrong but biden's demand on the other hand was a complete and total disaster the fake news knows this but doesn't want to report the fake news media and their partner the democrat party want to stay as far away as possible from the joe biden demand that the ukrainian government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son or they won't get a very large amount of us money so they fabricate a they're trying to turn what was a biden scandal into a trump scandal  the problem is trump did nothing wrong i want to express my gratitude to america's magnificent  for tonight's exquisite evening where we celebrated more than a century of loyal and devoted friendship between🇺🇸🇦🇺both of our nations are blessed by uncommon courage unfailing commitment and unyielding character  rachel campos-duffy has written a wonderful book for children paloma wants to be lady freedom she and her husband sean duffy have done so much for our country buy this book great for the kids  thank you working hard  🇺🇸🇦🇺  statement strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation that they would not have also come forward do you know the reason why they did not because there was nothing said wrong it was pitch perfect the radical left democrats and their fake news media partners headed up again by little adam schiff and batting zero for 21 against me are at it again they think i may have had a dicey conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a highly partisan whistleblowers oh no really big political news perhaps the biggest story in years part time mayor of new york city   who was polling at a solid zero but had tremendous room for growth has shocking dropped out of the presidential race nyc is devastated he's coming home the us economy is the envy of the world as europe and asia slide ever toward recession but the left is trying to avoid talking about the trump economy   the best is yet to come great news  just renewed her deal with fox i don't care how much they paid her they got a beautiful bargain congratulations to both nice meeting with mark zuckerberg of  in the oval office today   because of my administration drug prices are down for the first time in almost 50 years  but the american people need congress to help i like sen grassley's drug pricing bill very much and it's great to see speaker pelosi's bill today let's get it done in a bipartisan way presidential harassment knowing all of this is anybody dumb enough to believe that i would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially heavily populated call i would only do what is right anyway and only do good for the usa another fake news story out there it never ends virtually anytime i speak on the phone to a foreign leader i understand that there may be many people listening from various us agencies not to mention those from the other country itself no problem great progress on the border wall  all polls and some brand new polls show very little support for impeachment such a waste of time especially with sooo much good that could be done including prescription drug price reduction healthcare infrastructure etc thank you  jay powell and the federal reserve fail again no guts no sense no vision  a terrible communicator happy 72nd birthday to our great     far safer and much less expensive many more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard meaning significantly more jobs jobs jobs automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to california you will be out of business  advantage and also due to the fact that older highly polluting cars will be replaced by new extremely environmentally friendly cars there will be very little difference in emissions between the california standard and the new us standard but the cars will be the trump administration is revoking california's federal waiver on emissions in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer while at the same time making the cars substantially safer this will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety i am pleased to announce that i will name robert c o'brien currently serving as the very successful special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the state department as our new national security advisor i have worked long  hard with robert he will do a great job i have just instructed the secretary of the treasury to substantially increase sanctions on the country of iran so nice that our country is now energy independent the usa is in better shape than ever before

that the democrats are hurting our country and getting nothing done shameful    no lindsey it was a sign of strength that some people just don't understand  the new york times is now blaming an editor for the horrible mistake they made in trying to destroy or influence justice brett kavanaugh it wasn't the editor the times knew everything they are sick and desperate losing in so many ways such a beautiful opening statement by corey lewandowski thank you corey  just departed new mexico for california where we are delivering results  that story kavanaugh is nowhere near the standard that should be met in publishing a story   the new york times is at its lowest point in its long and storied history not only is it losing a lot of money but it is a journalistic disaster being laughed at even in the most liberal of enclaves it has become a very sad joke all all over the world witch hunt hurt them if you want to stop the drug smugglers human traffickers and vicious ms-13 gang members from threatening our communities and poisoning our youth you have only one choice  you must elect more republicans   we are all united by the same love of country the same devotion to family and the same

management the times is dead long live the new york times i call for the resignation of everybody at the new york times involved in the kavanaugh smear story and while you're at it the russian witch hunt hoax which is just as phony they've taken the old grey lady and broken her down destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation how many stories are wrong almost all of the stories the new york times has done are inaccurate and wrong   the new york times should close its doors and throw away the keys the women mentioned in the kavanaugh story said she didn't even remember the event congratulations   this afternoon at the  it was my great honor to present our nation's highest civilian honor the presidential medal of freedom to american baseball legend  congratulations on this extraordinary achievement mo  thank you working hard   big crowd expected in new mexico tonight where we will win your border wall is getting stronger each and every day  see you in a few hours  in a short while i will be presenting the new york   the greatest relief pitcher closer of all time with the presidential medal of freedom in the east room of the  for the privilege of being your president and doing the best job that has been done in many decades i am far beyond somebody paying for a hotel room for the evening or filling up a gas tank at an airport i do not own these radical left democrats are crazy obama netflix they failed on the mueller report they failed on robert mueller's testimony they failed on everything else so now the democrats are trying to build a case that i enrich myself by being president good idea except i will and have always expected to lose billions of dollars democrats would rather talk about gun control than get something done governor john sununu   the big questions are will they move the goalposts and is this just a ploy to take your guns away i hope not on both counts but i'll be able to figure it out remember when iran shot down a drone saying knowingly that it was in their airspace when in fact it was nowhere close they stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on saudi arabia we'll see just out kavanaugh accuser doesn't recall incident   do you believe what these horrible people will do or say they are looking to destroy and influence his opinions but played the game badly they should be sued what's happening to justice kavanaugh is a disgrace this guy is not a good man he is a great man he has to go to his church with his family while these terrible reports are being written about him a disgrace dan bongino  the new york times walks back report on kavanaugh assault claim   the one who is actually being assaulted is justice kavanaugh assaulted by lies and fake news this is all about the lamestream media working with their partner the dems the united states because of the federal reserve is paying a much higher interest rate than other competing countries they can't believe how lucky they are that jay powell  the fed don't have a clue and now on top of it all the oil hit big interest rate drop stimulus producer prices in china shrank most in 3 years due to china's big devaluation of their currency coupled with monetary stimulus federal reserve not watching will fed ever get into the game dollar strongest ever really bad for exports no inflationhighest interest rates because we have done so well with energy over the last few years thank you mr president we are a net energy exporter  now the number one energy producer in the world we don't need middle eastern oil  gas  in fact have very few tankers there but will help our allies 'these conservative judicial appointments will impact our nation for years to come' said lindsey graham republican of south carolina who leads the judiciary committee and who has been speeding through trump nominees the entire court system is changing at a record pace the  this week the senate passed a milestone in confirming the 150th federal judge of mr trump's administration to a lifetime appointment far outstripping barack obama's pace and fulfilling pledges by mr trump and mr o'connell to remake the federal judiciary work that way i have a better idea look at the obama book deal or the ridiculous netflix deal then look at all the deals made by the dems in congress the congressional slush fund and lastly the ig reports take a look at them those investigations would be over fast house judiciary has given up on the mueller report sadly for them after two years and $40000000 spent zero collusion zero obstruction so they say ok lets look at everything else and all of the deals that trump has done over his lifetime but it doesn't one my way to new mexico  see you all shortly at the    we cannot have what happened to this president happen again joe digenova  it is time for justice to come barreling in   can you imagine that with everything going on in this world the witch hunt though on a respirator is still whimpering along a disgrace the fake news is saying that i am willing to meet with iran no conditions that is an incorrect statement as usual here we go again with general motors and the united auto workers get together and make a deal plenty of oil saudi arabia oil supply was attacked there is reason to believe that we know the culprit are locked and loaded depending on verification but are waiting to hear from the kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied i have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in texas and various other states based on the attack on saudi arabia which may have an impact on oil prices i have authorized the release of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve if needed in a to-be-determined amount then on top of it all kathleen parker of all people wrote in case you were wondering trump won the debate true but what is going on at the  not fake news can't believe the  wrote a positive front page story unity issue has parties pointing to trump gop goes all in while democrats clash over ideology  tactics mr president we are with you the entire way republicans havecoalesced around trump i am fighting the fake corrupt news

150th federal judge this week can't let brett kavanaugh give radical left democrat liberal plus opinions based on threats of impeaching him over made up stories sound familiar false allegations and lies this is the game they play fake and corrupt news is working overtime  brett kavanaugh should start suing people for libel or the justice department should come to his rescue the lies being told about him are unbelievable false accusations without recrimination when does it stop they are trying to influence his opinions can't let that happen thank you  and  great interview brett kavanaugh should start suing people for liable or the justice department should come to his rescue the lies being told about him are unbelievable false accusations without recrimination when does it stop they

impeachment he is an innocent man who has been treated horribly such lies about him they want to scare him into turning liberal all based on nothing the dems can't get anything positive done and probably don't want to  thank you billy  thank you  my great honor  that is true and the usa is winning again  amazing  the taliban has never been hit harder than it is being hit right now killing 12 people including one great american soldier was not a good idea there are much better ways to set up a negotiation the taliban knows they made a big mistake and they have no idea how to recover i'm ok

important election we will win very stupidly negotiated trade deals and illegal immigration are a tremendous cost and burden to our country they are both coming along very well and someday in the not too distant future america will see a very positive change remember america first illegal immigration costs the usa over 300 billion dollars a year there is no reason for this and things are being set in motion to have this number come way down democrats could end loopholes and it would be a whole lot easier and faster but it will all happen anyway ig report which showed him to be a disgraced  dirty cop republicans have unified like never before you don't impeach presidents for doing a good great job no obstruction no collusion only treasonous crimes committed by the other side and led by the democrats sad became number 1 in world  independent in energy will soon have record number of judges 2 sc justices done more than any president in first 2 1/2 years despite phony  fraudulent witch hunt illegally led against him win on mueller report mueller testimony  james comey how do you impeach a president who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our country all time best unemployment numbers especially for blacks hispanics asians  women more people working today than ever before rebuilt military  choice for vets rt  if reports are accurate that the doj is recommending charges against former fbi deputy director andy mccabe i'm not surp hello baltimore  in fact my views on venezuela and especially cuba were far stronger than those of john bolton he was holding me back  this should have been over with after the mueller report came out   we can't beat him so lets impeach him democrat rep al green dems have never gotten over the fact that president trump won the election  mccarthy some really big court wins on the border lately it is expected that china will be buying large amounts of our agricultural products european central bank acting quickly cuts rates 10 basis points they are trying and succeeding in depreciating the euro against the very strong dollar hurting us exports and the fed sits and sits and sits they get paid to borrow money while we are paying interest thank you brandon  thank you  the wall is going up very fast despite total obstruction by democrats in congress and elsewhere  the wall is being built after victories against the democrats in various courts  the southern border is becoming very strong despite the obstruction by democrats not agreeing to do anything on loopholes or asylum i had an excellent telephone conversation with andrés manuel lópez obrador president of mexico talking about southern border security and various other things of mutual interest for the people of our respective countries on october 1st we have agreed as a gesture of good will to move the increased tariffs on 250 billion dollars worth of goods 25percent to 30percent from october 1st to october 15th at the request of the vice premier of china liu he and due to the fact that the people's republic of china will be celebrating their 70th anniversary big united states supreme court win for the border on asylum  today and every day we pledge to honor our history to treasure our liberty to uplift our communities to live up to our values to prove worthy of our heroes and above all to never forget   leaving the white house soon to speak at the pentagon my great honor if it weren't for the never ending fake news about me and with all that i have done more than any other president in the first 2 1/2 years i would be leading the partners of the lamestream media by 20 points sorry but true this is a phony suppression poll meant to build up their democrat partners i haven't even started campaigning yet and am constantly fighting fake news like russia russia russia look at north carolina last night dan bishop down big in the polls wins easier than 2016 in a hypothetical poll done by one of the worst pollsters of them all the amazon washington post/abc which predicted i would lose to crooked hillary by 15 points how did that work out sleepy joe pocahontas and virtually all others would beat me in the general election the usa should always be paying the the lowest rate no inflation it is only the naïveté of jay powell and the federal reserve that doesn't allow us to do what other countries are already doing a once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of boneheads the federal reserve should get our interest rates down to zero or less and we should then start to refinance our debt interest cost could be brought way down while at the same time substantially lengthening the term we have the great currency power and balance sheet china suspends tariffs on some us products being hit very hard supply chains breaking up as many companies move or look to move to other countries much more expensive to china than originally thought    greg murphy won big 62percent to 37percent in north carolina 03  the fake news barely covered the race the win was far bigger than anticipated there was just nothing the fakers could say to diminish or demean the scope of this victory so we had two big victories tonight greg  dan alice  stewart thank you for the nice words while on  concerning the two big republican congressional victories you'd be great on a network with much higher ratings keep up the good work    were all set to have a big victory until dan bishop won north carolina 09 now you will hear them barely talk about or cover the race fake news never wins big night for the republican party congratulations to all greg murphy is a big winner in north carolina 03 much bigger margins than originally anticipated congratulations greg dan bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago he then asked me for help we changed his strategy together and he ran a great race big rally last night now it looks like he is going to win    are moving their big studio equipment and talent out stay tuned dan bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago he then asked me for help we changed his strategy together and he ran a great race big rally last night now it looks like he is going to win    are moving their big studio equipment and to talent out stay tuned senator ben sasse has done a wonderful job representing the people of nebraska he is great with our vets the military and your very important second amendment strong on crime and the border ben has my complete and total endorsement i am pleased to endorse governor mike parson of missouri he is very popular strong and knows what he is doing  he gets it based on the fact that mike has announced he will run again in 2020 for governor mike parson has my complete and total endorsement excellent interview by  on  on  very interesting and secure perspective on life one down one to go  greg murphy is projected to win in the great state of north carolina  incredible progress being made at the southern border  i asked john for his resignation which was given to me this morning i thank john very much for his service i will be naming a new national security advisor next week i informed john bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the white house i disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions as did others in the administration and therefore vote today for dan bishop will be great for north carolina and our country one of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the fake and corrupt news media is the phony polling information they put out many of these polls are fixed or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad internal polling looks great the best ever abc/washington post poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the 2016 election when my lawyers protested they took a 12 point down and brought it to almost even by election day it was a fake poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets sad north carolina vote for dan bishop today we need him badly in washington last night in north carolina was incredible  great job by the us coast guard  thank you  great job  beautiful evening in fayetteville tonight big day in north carolina tomorrow make sure you get out and vote for dan bishop in  and greg murphy in   thank you fayetteville north carolina make sure you get out and vote tomorrow for dan bishop in  and greg murphy in   north carolina  vote for dan bishop in  and greg murphy in  tomorrow make it a great day for republicans received an update on air force one at mcas cherry point in north carolina regarding damage caused by hurricane dorian  departing mcas cherry point in north carolina for fayetteville north carolina this is amazing  speaking to governor  of south carolina on my way to north carolina for a big rally for dan bishop  running for congress vote tomorrow   to every one of the heroes we recognized today  thank you and god bless you all  we have been serving as policemen in afghanistan and that was not meant to be the job of our great soldiers the finest on earth over the last four days we have been hitting our enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years the economy where there is no recession much to the regret of the lamestream media they are working overtime to help the democrats win in 2020 but that will never happen americans are too smart the look of turmoil in the white house of which there is none i view much of the media as simply an arm of the democrat party they are corrupt and they are extremely upset at how well our country is doing under my leadership including a lot of fake news is being reported that i overruled the vp and various advisers on a potential camp david meeting with the taliban this story is false i always think it is good to meet and talk but in this case i decided not to the dishonest media likes to create the trump administration has achieved more in the first 2 1/2 years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our country we get zero media credit for what we have done and are doing but the people know and that's all that is important i had nothing to do with the decision of our great  mike pence to stay overnight at one of the trump owned resorts in doonbeg ireland mike's family has lived in doonbeg for many years and he thought that during his very busy european visit he would stop and see his family i know nothing about an air force plane landing at an airport which i do not own and have nothing to do with near turnberry resort which i do own in scotland and filling up with fuel with the crew staying overnight at turnberry they have good taste nothing to do with me that this administration has done they don't talk about the great economy the big tax and regulation cuts the rebuilding of the military choice at our va our vets judges and supreme court justices the border wall going up lowest crime numbers 2nd a and so much more as bad as  is comcast msnbc is worse their ratings are also way down because they have lost all credibility i believe their stories about me are not 93percent negative but actually 100percent negative they are incapable of saying anything positive despite all of the great things but most importantly  is bad for the usa their international division spews bad information  fake news all over the globe this is why foreign leaders are always asking me why does the media hate the us sooo much it is a fraudulent shame  all comes from the top great news that an activist investor is now involved with att as the owner of very low ratings  perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the fake news emanating from its non-credible anchors also i hear that because of its bad ratings it is losing a fortune 94percent approval rating in the republican party a record thank you house republicans should allow chairs of committees to remain for longer than 6 years it forces great people and real leaders to leave after serving the dems have unlimited terms while that has its own problems it is a better way to go fewer people in the end will leave but then he ran for congress and won only to lose his re-elect after i tweeted my endorsement on election day for his opponent but now take heart he is back and running for president of the united states the three stooges all badly failed candidates will give it a go when the former governor of the great state of south carolina  was reported missing only to then say he was away hiking on the appalachian trail then was found in argentina with his flaming dancer friend it sounded like his political career was over it was north carolina vote for dan bishop tomorrow we need him badly in washington his opponent is a far left sanctuary cities supporter maria  john understood the dishonesty  deception from the very beginning  the importance or passage of criminal justice reform they only talk about the minor players or people that had nothing to do with itand the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed all they talk about now is impeaching president trump musician  and his filthy mouthed wife are talking now about how great it is but i didn't see them around when we needed help getting it passed anchor doesn't even bring up the subject of president trump or the republicans when talking about a man named  and many others were profusely grateful at that time i signed it into law no one else did  republicans deserve much credit but now that it is passed people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise guys like boring when all of the people pushing so hard for criminal justice reform were  unable to come even close to getting it done they came to me as a group and asked for my help i got it done with a group of senators  others who would never have gone for it obama couldn't come close the trump administrations has achieved more in the first 2 1/2 years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our country we get zero media credit for what we have done and are doing but the people know and that's all that is important congratulations to  pirro on having again the number one best selling book looking forward to being in the north carolina tomorrow night we're having a big rally for a great guy dan bishop strong on crime borders your military and our vets we need dan bishop in washington badly his opponent is weak on crime borders and against your 2nd a we are building the wall  leakin' lyin' james comey  only made it worse if they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks and would even kill 12 innocent people then they probably don't have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway how many more decades are they willing to fight an attack in kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers and 11 other people i immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations what kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position they didn't they unbeknownst to almost everyone the major taliban leaders and separately the president of afghanistan were going to secretly meet with me at camp david on sunday they were coming to the united states tonight unfortunately in order to build false leverage they admitted to fake news i would like very much to stop referring to this ridiculous story but the lamestream media just won't let it alone they always have to have the last word even though they know they are defrauding  deceiving the public the public knows that the media is corrupt the failing new york times stated in an article written by obama flunky peter baker who lovingly wrote obama bookeven after the president forecast the storm to include alabama this is not true i said very early on that it may even hit alabama a big difference our economy is doing great  jobs jobs jobs  congratulations to the great jerry west   thank you katie the us is doing great  russia and ukraine just swapped large numbers of prisoners very good news perhaps a first giant step to peace congratulations to both countries in 22 years of patrolling our southern border i have never seen mexico act like a true border security partner until president trump got involved and now they are stepping up to the plate and doing what they need to do brandon judd national border patrol the washington post's  mr off the record   two nasty lightweight reporters shouldn't even be allowed on the grounds of the white house because their reporting is so disgusting  fake also add the appointment of many federal judges this summer  i want to congratulate  mitch mcconnell and all republicans today i signed the 160th federal judge to the bench within a short period of time we will be at over 200 federal judges including many in the appellate courts  two great new us supreme court justices i would also like to thank papa doug manchester hopefully the next ambassador to the bahamas for the incredible amount of time money and passion he has spent on helping to bring safety to the bahamas much work to be done by the bahamian government we will help  thank you to bahamian prime minister hubert minnis for your very gracious and kind words in saying that without the help of the united states and me their would have been many more casualties i give all credit to fema the us coast guard  the brave people of the bahamas china just enacted a major stimulus plan with all the tariffs they are paying to the usa billions and billions of dollars they need it in the meantime our federal reserve sits back and does nothing promises made promises kept  that were not hit  and that are in good condition any cruise ship companies willing to act as stationary housing etc i am sure would be appreciated the   and all others along with other countries that have been helping have been asked to move people in the badly hit sections of the bahamas to other sections of the bahamas the washington post's lost summer  china is eating the tariffs billions pouring into usa targeted patriot farmers getting massive dollars from the incoming tariffs good jobs numbers no inflationfed china having worst year in decades talks happening good for all the economy is great the only thing adding to uncertainty is the fake news great job by fema law enforcement first responders us coast guard and all keep going we all appreciate what you are doing partner should start playing it straight it would be so much better for our country this nonsense has never happened to another president four days of corrupt reporting still without an apology but there are many things that the fake news media has not apologized to me for like the witch hunt or spygate the lamestream media and their democrat the fake news media was fixated on the fact that i properly said at the beginnings of hurricane dorian that in addition to florida  other states alabama may also be grazed or hit they went crazy hoping against hope that i made a mistake which i didn't check out maps larry kudlow on  now our great  has just written a book that will add to the tremendous success of her last number one best seller it's called radicals resistance and revenge the left's plot to remake america it is a fantastic book go get it  great interview of sarah sanders by  she is a terrific person with a great future congratulations to  and his sister on a great success what a wonderful thing to do i agree with  the fed should lower rates they were way too early to raise and way too late to cut and big dose quantitative tightening didn't exactly help either where did i find this guy jerome oh well you can't win them all daca will be going before the supreme court it is a document that even president obama didn't feel he had the legal right to sign he signed it anyway rest assured that if the sc does what all say it must based on the law a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all president obama never had the legal right to sign daca and he indicated so at the time of signing but in any event how can he have the right to sign and i don't have the right to unsigned totally illegal document which would actually give the president new powers have the discretion to end the program that president obama began in his discretion that program was unlawful to begin with i think it's very unlikely that the scotus is going to issue an order reinstating what it believes is an unlawful program daca is unlawful  the immigration law institute's christopher hajec says the supreme court has to look st whether daca is lawful what they are looking at now is whether trump's recision of daca is lawful must consider lawfulness of daca itself looks very odd that president trump doesn't that our economy is very strong if the fed would lower rates to where the bond market says they should be then i really wouldn't worry about a recession   i think president trump is set in his ways because he doesn't see any weakening i mean look at the joblessness report today what i'm surprised at is how strong the consumer is i think the chinese need it a deal more than we do it's statistical i just think looking forward to watching  sanders tomorrow morning on  by far the  rated show on morning cable at 8:30am sarah will be an incredible addition to  great job done by   senator  and all of the those from florida that were so brilliantly involved including   law enforcement and first responders thank you all just got off the phone with governor brian kemp  of georgia happy to hear that things are looking good for everyone i stand by ready to assist along with our great team at   we're with you all the way just spoke to governor  of south carolina regarding hurricane dorian i informed henry that we are monitoring south carolina and stand by ready to assist be safe everyone we are totally with you just talked to governor roy cooper of north carolina as hurricane dorian ominously comes up the east coast we are monitoring it at the  ready to assist via our great team over at  who are already on site we are with you all the way north carolina be safe i was with you all the way alabama the fake news media was not  just as i said alabama was originally projected to be hit the fake news denies it  his dedication to israel and to seeking peace between israel and the palestinians won't be forgotten he will be missed thank you jason after almost 3 years in my administration jason greenblatt will be leaving to pursue work in the private sector jason has been a loyal and great friend and fantastic lawyer really good jobs numbers alabama was going to be hit or grazed and then hurricane dorian took a different path up along the east coast the fake news knows this very well that's why they're the fake news said what she did even being on a much higher rated show she would have been thrown off television will fake news nbc allow a mccarthy style racist to continue abc fired roseanne watch the double standard bad actress debra the mess messing is in hot water she wants to create a blacklist of trump supporters  is being accused of mccarthyism is also being accused of being a racist because of the terrible things she said about blacks and mental illness if roseanne barr instead it turned north and went up the coast where it continues now in the one model through florida the great state of alabama would have been hit or grazed in the path it took no read my full fema statement what i said was accurate all fake news in order to demean in the early days of the hurricane when it was predicted that dorian would go through miami or west palm beach even before it reached the bahamas certain models strongly suggested that alabama  georgia would be hit as it made its way through florida  to the gulf thank you rad looking great  thank you terrence best employment numbers in history for african americans  information does come out charlie hurt washington times   facts and that should terrify every american regardless of their political stripe the idea that all of that information hasn't already been revealed shows how dastardly these people are and how terrified they are about what's going to happen when that absolutely nothing is more important than going back  getting to the bottom of the origins of the investigation we had an administration using america's spying apparatus to spy on a political opponent at the height of a presidential election those are all known undisputed this was the originally projected path of the hurricane in its early stages as you can see almost all models predicted it to go through florida also hitting georgia and alabama i accept the fake news apologies  state rep greg murphy is running for congress in north carolina district 3 we really need greg in washington he is great w/ the military our vets  your 2a strong on crime and the border has had my total endorsement for a long time please vote for greg on september 10th 7 the badly flawed paris climate agreement protects the polluters hurts americans and cost a fortune not on my watch8 i want crystal clean water and the cleanest and the purest air on the planet  we've now got that 6 the democrats' destructive environmental proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump don't the democrats care about fighting american poverty 4 the us now leads the world in energy productionbut 5 who's got the world's cleanest and safest air and water america 1 which country has the largest carbon emission reductionamerica2 who has dumped the most carbon into the air   china3 91percent of the world's population are exposed to air pollution above the world health organization's suggested level   none are in the usa 8 facts that  will ignore in tonight's climate forum we can't have a system where we run our entire economy for the benefit of other countries which have long charged us big tariffs don't keep ducking the reality the us has been subject to tariff terrorism for 50 years but a real deal can be done sam zell  trump is doing to china is not lost on the rest of the world europe has had among the most protectionist policies forever they're sitting there and saying gee are we next maybe you are we've got to change the rules the us can't defend the world and pay for it the chinese are very adept at not accepting anything you've got to be very tough and that's what trump is doing it's in china's interest to correct and i think we'll end up with a solution that's dramatically better than we have today frankly i think the impact of what us winning trade war with china in dollars cnbc we can't have a system where we run our entire economy for the benefit of other countries which have long charged us big tariffs don't keep ducking the reality the us has been subject to tariff terrorism for 50 years but a real deal can be done sam zell  trump is doing to china is not lost on the rest of the world europe has had among the most protectionist policies forever they're sitting there and saying gee are we next maybe you are we've got to change the rules the us can't defend the world and pay for it the chinese are very adept at not accepting anything you've got to be very tough and that's what trump is doing it's in china's interest to correct and i think we'll end up with a solution that's dramatically better than we have today frankly i think the impact of what on the president of the united states   to declassify is so important because if this were a democrat president or a democrat candidate that was spied on the way president trump was spied on this would be a scandal that would make watergate look like nothing illegal spying i am so tired of hearing the rationalization of the left in the country because they hate donald trump inexplicably and without foundation they choose to hate america the democrats have truly become the party of hate  the truth is that we have a nation that is disgusted with the fbi we have a crisis of confidence in the number one law enforcement agency in this country thanks comey  it's a scandal  at the request of senator thom tillis i am getting the north carolina emergency declaration completed and signed tonight hope you won't need it the us may be getting a little bit lucky with respect to hurricane dorian but please don't let down your guard as it heads up the coast lots of very bad and unpredictable things can happen on the other hand the bahamas have been devastated we are sending crews to help  knife crime which is totally out of control in london people are afraid to even walk the streets he is a terrible mayor who should stay out of our business the incompetent mayor of london sadiq khan was bothered that i played a very fast round of golf yesterday many pols exercise for hours or travel for weeks me i run through one of my courses very inexpensive president obama would fly to hawaii kahn should focus on based on the ig report the whole witch hunt against me and my administration was a giant and illegal scam the house of representatives should now get back to work on drug prices healthcare infrastructure and all else the mueller report showed no collusion no obstruction germany and so many other countries have negative interest rates they get paid for loaning money and our federal reserve fails to act remember these are also our weak currency competitors for all of the geniuses out there many who have been in other administrations and taken to the cleaners by china that want me to get together with the eu and others to go after china trade practices remember the eu  all treat us very unfairly on trade also will change and then think what happens to china when i win deal would get much tougher in the meantime china's supply chain will crumble and businesses jobs and money will be gone we are doing very well in our negotiations with china while i am sure they would love to be dealing with a new administration so they could continue their practice of ripoff usa$600 b/year16 months plus is a long time to be hemorrhaging jobs and companies on a long-shot trade agreement      making great progress for our farmers approved e-15 year round big additional list to be submitted  approved within two weeks will be even better for ethanol and we save our small refineries brazil will allow more american ethanol to enter the country without tariffs a decision that brazilian mills are celebrating the seemingly counter-intuitive reaction stems from the tone of ongoing negotiations between the south american nation and the us for a knife crime which is totally out of control in london people are afraid to even walk the streets he is a terrible mayor who should stay out of our business the incompetent mayor of london sadique kahn was bothered that i played a very fast round of golf yesterday many pols exercise for hours or travel for weeks me i run through one of my courses very inexpensive president obama would fly to hawaii kahn should focus on when in fact under certain original scenarios it was in fact correct that alabama could have received some hurt always good to be prepared but the fake news is only interested in demeaning and belittling didn't play my whole sentence or statement bad people such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter  of  i suggested yesterday at fema that along with florida georgia south carolina and north carolina even alabama could possibly come into play which was true they made a big deal about this the good news is that we are winning our real opponent is not the democrats or the dwindling number of republicans that lost their way and got left behind our primary opponent is the fake news media in the history of our country they have never been so bad the lamestream media has gone totally crazy they write whatever they want seldom have sources even though they say they do never do fact checking anymore and are only looking for the kill they take good news and make it bad they are now beyond fake they are corrupt the amazon washington post did a story that i brought racist attacks against the squad no they brought racist attacks against our nation all i do is call them out for the horrible things they have said the democrats have become the party of the squad trump economics with president trump tariffs are bringing companies back to the usa like he said they would  swing states that went to trump in 2016 because he promised not to forget about them like the establishment had done for decades and their trust in president trump paid off as they saw their incomes riseand it's the lowest paid workers who have gained the most with average hourly wages growth has far outpaced what we saw with president obama across all industries from mining and construction to leisure  hospitality with president trump we see income growth in states like iowa ohio pennsylvania wisconsin nevada florida the last three years of trump policy have finally brought real hope and real change unemployment this year hit a 50 year low with president trump we've seen the lowest ever african american and hispanic unemployment the booming trump economy has pushed up workers wages they are liars and in my opinion traitors  talking about comey and his dwindling group of friends and watched nafta is the worst trade deal ever made terrible for labor and richard let it stand no wonder unions are losing so much the workers will vote for me in 2020 lowest unemployment most jobs ever and should stop paying exorbitant $dues not worth it just watched afl-cio president richard trumka on  and thought to myself how different he is on tv than he is when he is with me at the white house likes what we are doing until the cameras go on we got robbed on trade and everything else while his dems just sat back since my election many trillions of dollars of worth has been created for our country and the stock market is up over 50percent if you followed the advice of the failing new york times columnist paul krugman you'd be doing very poorly you'd be angry and hurt he never got it adds up to the most ambitious pro-worker policy agenda this country has ever seen the president promised jobs jobs jobs and that is exactly what he is delivering    when you put everything together the pro growth tax  regulation cuts help to retrain workers the tariffs which encourage manufacturers to come back to america along with president trumps tough approach on immigration strong stance on illegals promoting merit based it when in fact under certain original scenarios it was in fact correct that alabama could have received some hurt always good to be prepared but the fake news is only interested in demeaning and belittling didn't play my whole sentence or statement bad people such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter  of  i suggested yesterday at fema that along with florida georgia south carolina and north carolina even alabama could possibly come into play which was true they made a big deal about this trade agreement       making great progress for our farmers approved e-15 year round big additional list to be submitted and approved within two weeks will be even better for ethanol and we save our small refineries brazil will allow more american ethanol to enter the country without tariffs a decision that brazilian mills are celebrating the seemingly counter-intuitive reaction stems from the tone of ongoing negotiations between the south american nation and the us for a this judge thomas ambro majotity opinion and thank god for a president like donald j trump who will appoint judges like this he will soon have appointed 180 new federal judges not even including two great new supreme court justices   we hold that legislative prayer is government speech not open to attack via those channels third circuit court of appeals lou that's why this next election is so important the soul of america they want to take religion out of american lives thank god for judges like pray for the people in the bahamas being hit like never before category 5  almost 200 mph winds great job by texas law enforcement and first responders in handling the terrible shooting tragedy yesterday thank you also to the fbi  and all others a very tough and sad situation in addition to florida south carolina north carolina georgia and alabama will most likely be hit much harder than anticipated looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever already category 5 be careful god bless everyone this is only the beginning  i have not forgotten that when it was announced that i was going to do the apprentice and when it then became a big hit helping nbc's failed lineup greatly  came up to me at an upfront  profusely thanked me even calling me sir how times have changed comey and mccabe and more are dirty cops joe digenova reports are coming comey very vulnerable but where is the supreme court where is justice roberts if you lie to a court you should be held in contempt so if you abused the fisa you must be held accountable i hope justice roberts will take action jason chaffetz fox james comey has been rebuked at the highest level with much more to come an ig report doesn't get any stronger calling him dangerous insubordinate thank goodness that donald trump was elected because if he wasn't elected these people would still be in power two more is about american freedom redirect the supply chain there is no reason to buy everything from china peter morici economist tariffs will not impact american consumers that much because the chinese currency has gone down which gives our importers a discount importers can find suppliers outside of china absolutely worth it we don't want to be servants to the chinese this
